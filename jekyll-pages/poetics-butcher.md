<h2>ARISTOTLE'S POETICS</h2>

</div><div id="link2H_4_0003" class="book_section">
<h2>I</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  I propose to treat of Poetry in itself and of its various kinds, noting the essential quality of each; to inquire into the structure of the plot as requisite to a good poem; into the number and nature of the parts of which a poem is composed; and similarly into whatever else falls within the same inquiry.</div><div class="sentence"> Following, then, the order of nature, let us begin with the principles which come first.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Epic poetry and Tragedy, Comedy also and Dithyrambic: poetry, and the music of the flute and of the lyre in most of their forms, are all in their general conception modes of imitation.</div><div class="sentence"> They differ, however, from one: another in three respects,—the medium, the objects, the manner or mode of imitation, being in each case distinct.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  For as there are persons who, by conscious art or mere habit, imitate and represent various objects through the medium of colour and form, or again by the voice; so in the arts above mentioned, taken as a whole, the imitation is produced by rhythm, language, or 'harmony,' either singly or combined.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  Thus in the music of the flute and of the lyre, 'harmony' and rhythm alone are employed; also in other arts, such as that of the shepherd's pipe, which are essentially similar to these.</div><div class="sentence"> In dancing, rhythm alone is used without 'harmony'; for even dancing imitates character, emotion, and action, by rhythmical movement.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  There is another art which imitates by means of language alone, and that either in prose or verse—which, verse, again, may either combine different metres or consist of but one kind—but this has hitherto been without a name.</div><div class="sentence"> For there is no common term we could apply to the mimes of Sophron and Xenarchus and the Socratic dialogues on the one hand; and, on the other, to poetic imitations in iambic, elegiac, or any similar metre.</div><div class="sentence"> People do, indeed, add the word 'maker' or 'poet' to the name of the metre, and speak of elegiac poets, or epic (that is, hexameter) poets, as if it were not the imitation that makes the poet, but the verse that entitles them all indiscriminately to the name.</div><div class="sentence"> Even when a treatise on medicine or natural science is brought out in verse, the name of poet is by custom given to the author; and yet Homer and Empedocles have nothing in common but the metre, so that it would be right to call the one poet, the other physicist rather than poet.</div><div class="sentence"> On the same principle, even if a writer in his poetic imitation were to combine all metres, as Chaeremon did in his Centaur, which is a medley composed of metres of all kinds, we should bring him too under the general term poet.</div><div class="sentence"> So much then for these distinctions.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  There are, again, some arts which employ all the means above mentioned, namely, rhythm, tune, and metre.</div><div class="sentence"> Such are Dithyrambic and Nomic poetry, and also Tragedy and Comedy; but between them the difference is, that in the first two cases these means are all employed in combination, in the latter, now one means is employed, now another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  Such, then, are the differences of the arts with respect to the medium of imitation.</div></div>

</div><div id="link2H_4_0004" class="book_section">
<h2>II</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  Since the objects of imitation are men in action, and these men must be either of a higher or a lower type (for moral character mainly answers to these divisions, goodness and badness being the distinguishing marks of moral differences), it follows that we must represent men either as better than in real life, or as worse, or as they are.</div><div class="sentence"> It is the same in painting.</div><div class="sentence"> Polygnotus depicted men as nobler than they are, Pauson as less noble, Dionysius drew them true to life.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Now it is evident that each of the modes of imitation above mentioned will exhibit these differences, and become a distinct kind in imitating objects that are thus distinct.</div><div class="sentence"> Such diversities may be found even in dancing, flute-playing, and lyre-playing.</div><div class="sentence"> So again in language, whether prose or verse unaccompanied by music.</div><div class="sentence"> Homer, for example, makes men better than they are; Cleophon as they are; Hegemon the Thasian, the inventor of parodies, and Nicochares, the author of the Deiliad, worse than they are.</div><div class="sentence"> The same thing holds good of Dithyrambs and Nomes; here too one may portray different types, as Timotheus and Philoxenus differed in representing their Cyclopes.</div><div class="sentence"> The same distinction marks off Tragedy from Comedy; for Comedy aims at representing men as worse, Tragedy as better than in actual life.</div></div>

</div><div id="link2H_4_0005" class="book_section">
<h2>III</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  There is still a third difference—the manner in which each of these objects may be imitated.</div><div class="sentence"> For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  These, then, as we said at the beginning, are the three differences which distinguish artistic imitation,—the medium, the objects, and the manner.</div><div class="sentence"> So that from one point of view, Sophocles is an imitator of the same kind as Homer—for both imitate higher types of character; from another point of view, of the same kind as Aristophanes—for both imitate persons acting and doing.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence, some say, the name of 'drama' is given to such poems, as representing action.</div><div class="sentence"> For the same reason the Dorians claim the invention both of Tragedy and Comedy.</div><div class="sentence"> The claim to Comedy is put forward by the Megarians,—not only by those of Greece proper, who allege that it originated under their democracy, but also by the Megarians of Sicily, for the poet Epicharmus, who is much earlier than Chionides and Magnes, belonged to that country.</div><div class="sentence"> Tragedy too is claimed by certain Dorians of the Peloponnese.</div><div class="sentence"> In each case they appeal to the evidence of language.</div><div class="sentence"> The outlying villages, they say, are by them called {kappa omega mu alpha iota}, by the Athenians {delta eta mu iota}: and they assume that Comedians were so named not from {kappa omega mu 'alpha zeta epsilon iota nu}, 'to revel,' but because they wandered from village to village (kappa alpha tau alpha / kappa omega mu alpha sigma), being excluded contemptuously from the city.</div><div class="sentence"> They add also that the Dorian word for 'doing' is {delta rho alpha nu}, and the Athenian, {pi rho alpha tau tau epsilon iota nu}.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  This may suffice as to the number and nature of the various modes of imitation.</div></div>

</div><div id="link2H_4_0006" class="book_section">
<h2>IV</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  Poetry in general seems to have sprung from two causes, each of them lying deep in our nature.</div><div class="sentence"> First, the instinct of imitation is implanted in man from childhood, one difference between him and other animals being that he is the most imitative of living creatures, and through imitation learns his earliest lessons; and no less universal is the pleasure felt in things imitated.</div><div class="sentence"> We have evidence of this in the facts of experience.</div><div class="sentence"> Objects which in themselves we view with pain, we delight to contemplate when reproduced with minute fidelity: such as the forms of the most ignoble animals and of dead bodies.</div><div class="sentence"> The cause of this again is, that to learn gives the liveliest pleasure, not only to philosophers but to men in general; whose capacity, however, of learning is more limited.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus the reason why men enjoy seeing a likeness is, that in contemplating it they find themselves learning or inferring, and saying perhaps, 'Ah, that is he.'</div><div class="sentence"> For if you happen not to have seen the original, the pleasure will be due not to the imitation as such, but to the execution, the colouring, or some such other cause.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature.</div><div class="sentence"> Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, metres being manifestly sections of rhythm.</div><div class="sentence"> Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Poetry now diverged in two directions, according to the individual character of the writers.</div><div class="sentence"> The graver spirits imitated noble actions, and the actions of good men.</div><div class="sentence"> The more trivial sort imitated the actions of meaner persons, at first composing satires, as the former did hymns to the gods and the praises of famous men.</div><div class="sentence"> A poem of the satirical kind cannot indeed be put down to any author earlier than Homer; though many such writers probably there were.</div><div class="sentence"> But from Homer onward, instances can be cited,—his own Margites, for example, and other similar compositions.</div><div class="sentence"> The appropriate metre was also here introduced; hence the measure is still called the iambic or lampooning measure, being that in which people lampooned one another.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus the older poets were distinguished as writers of heroic or of lampooning verse.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  As, in the serious style, Homer is pre-eminent among poets, for he alone combined dramatic form with excellence of imitation, so he too first laid down the main lines of Comedy, by dramatising the ludicrous instead of writing personal satire.</div><div class="sentence"> His Margites bears the same relation to Comedy that the Iliad and Odyssey do to Tragedy.</div><div class="sentence"> But when Tragedy and Comedy came to light, the two classes of poets still followed their natural bent: the lampooners became writers of Comedy, and the Epic poets were succeeded by Tragedians, since the drama was a larger and higher form of art.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  Whether Tragedy has as yet perfected its proper types or not; and whether it is to be judged in itself, or in relation also to the audience,—this raises another question.</div><div class="sentence"> Be that as it may, Tragedy—as also Comedy—was at first mere improvisation.</div><div class="sentence"> The one originated with the authors of the Dithyramb, the other with those of the phallic songs, which are still in use in many of our cities.</div><div class="sentence"> Tragedy advanced by slow degrees; each new element that showed itself was in turn developed.</div><div class="sentence"> Having passed through many changes, it found its natural form, and there it stopped.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  Aeschylus first introduced a second actor; he diminished the importance of the Chorus, and assigned the leading part to the dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> Sophocles raised the number of actors to three, and added scene-painting.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover, it was not till late that the short plot was discarded for one of greater compass, and the grotesque diction of the earlier satyric form for the stately manner of Tragedy.</div><div class="sentence"> The iambic measure then replaced the trochaic tetrameter, which was originally employed when the poetry was of the Satyric order, and had greater affinities with dancing.</div><div class="sentence"> Once dialogue had come in, Nature herself discovered the appropriate measure.</div><div class="sentence"> For the iambic is, of all measures, the most colloquial: we see it in the fact that conversational speech runs into iambic lines more frequently than into any other kind of verse; rarely into hexameters, and only when we drop the colloquial intonation.</div><div class="sentence"> The additions to the number of 'episodes' or acts, and the other accessories of which tradition; tells, must be taken as already described; for to discuss them in detail would, doubtless, be a large undertaking.</div></div>

</div><div id="link2H_4_0007" class="book_section">
<h2>V</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  Comedy is, as we have said, an imitation of characters of a lower type, not, however, in the full sense of the word bad, the Ludicrous being merely a subdivision of the ugly.</div><div class="sentence"> It consists in some defect or ugliness which is not painful or destructive.</div><div class="sentence"> To take an obvious example, the comic mask is ugly and distorted, but does not imply pain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  The successive changes through which Tragedy passed, and the authors of these changes, are well known, whereas Comedy has had no history, because it was not at first treated seriously.</div><div class="sentence"> It was late before the Archon granted a comic chorus to a poet; the performers were till then voluntary.</div><div class="sentence"> Comedy had already taken definite shape when comic poets, distinctively so called, are heard of.</div><div class="sentence"> Who furnished it with masks, or prologues, or increased the number of actors,—these and other similar details remain unknown.</div><div class="sentence"> As for the plot, it came originally from Sicily; but of Athenian writers Crates was the first who, abandoning the 'iambic' or lampooning form, generalised his themes and plots.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Epic poetry agrees with Tragedy in so far as it is an imitation in verse of characters of a higher type.</div><div class="sentence"> They differ, in that Epic poetry admits but one kind of metre, and is narrative in form.</div><div class="sentence"> They differ, again, in their length: for Tragedy endeavours, as far as possible, to confine itself to a single revolution of the sun, or but slightly to exceed this limit; whereas the Epic action has no limits of time.</div><div class="sentence"> This, then, is a second point of difference; though at first the same freedom was admitted in Tragedy as in Epic poetry.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  Of their constituent parts some are common to both, some peculiar to Tragedy, whoever, therefore, knows what is good or bad Tragedy, knows also about Epic poetry.</div><div class="sentence"> All the elements of an Epic poem are found in Tragedy, but the elements of a Tragedy are not all found in the Epic poem.</div></div>

</div><div id="link2H_4_0008" class="book_section">
<h2>VI</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  Of the poetry which imitates in hexameter verse, and of Comedy, we will speak hereafter.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us now discuss Tragedy, resuming its formal definition, as resulting from what has been already said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Tragedy, then, is an imitation of an action that is serious, complete, and of a certain magnitude; in language embellished with each kind of artistic ornament, the several kinds being found in separate parts of the play; in the form of action, not of narrative; through pity and fear effecting the proper purgation of these emotions.</div><div class="sentence"> By 'language embellished,' I mean language into which rhythm, 'harmony,' and song enter.</div><div class="sentence"> By 'the several kinds in separate parts,' I mean, that some parts are rendered through the medium of verse alone, others again with the aid of song.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Now as tragic imitation implies persons acting, it necessarily follows, in the first place, that Spectacular equipment will be a part of Tragedy.</div><div class="sentence"> Next, Song and Diction, for these are the medium of imitation.</div><div class="sentence"> By 'Diction' I mean the mere metrical arrangement of the words: as for 'Song,' it is a term whose sense every one understands.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, Tragedy is the imitation of an action; and an action implies personal agents, who necessarily possess certain distinctive qualities both of character and thought; for it is by these that we qualify actions themselves, and these—thought and character—are the two natural causes from which actions spring, and on actions again all success or failure depends.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence, the Plot is the imitation of the action: for by plot I here mean the arrangement of the incidents.</div><div class="sentence"> By Character I mean that in virtue of which we ascribe certain qualities to the agents.</div><div class="sentence"> Thought is required wherever a statement is proved, or, it may be, a general truth enunciated.</div><div class="sentence"> Every Tragedy, therefore, must have six parts, which parts determine its quality—namely, Plot, Character, Diction, Thought, Spectacle, Song.</div><div class="sentence"> Two of the parts constitute the medium of imitation, one the manner, and three the objects of imitation.</div><div class="sentence"> And these complete the list.</div><div class="sentence"> These elements have been employed, we may say, by the poets to a man; in fact, every play contains Spectacular elements as well as Character, Plot, Diction, Song, and Thought.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  But most important of all is the structure of the incidents.</div><div class="sentence"> For Tragedy is an imitation, not of men, but of an action and of life, and life consists in action, and its end is a mode of action, not a quality.</div><div class="sentence"> Now character determines men's qualities, but it is by their actions that they are happy or the reverse.</div><div class="sentence"> Dramatic action, therefore, is not with a view to the representation of character: character comes in as subsidiary to the actions.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence the incidents and the plot are the end of a tragedy; and the end is the chief thing of all.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, without action there cannot be a tragedy; there may be without character.</div><div class="sentence"> The tragedies of most of our modern poets fail in the rendering of character; and of poets in general this is often true.</div><div class="sentence"> It is the same in painting; and here lies the difference between Zeuxis and Polygnotus.</div><div class="sentence"> Polygnotus delineates character well: the style of Zeuxis is devoid of ethical quality.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, if you string together a set of speeches expressive of character, and well finished in point of diction and thought, you will not produce the essential tragic effect nearly so well as with a play which, however deficient in these respects, yet has a plot and artistically constructed incidents.</div><div class="sentence"> Besides which, the most powerful elements of emotional: interest in Tragedy Peripeteia or Reversal of the Situation, and Recognition scenes—are parts of the plot.</div><div class="sentence"> A further proof is, that novices in the art attain to finish: of diction and precision of portraiture before they can construct the plot.</div><div class="sentence"> It is the same with almost all the early poets.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  The Plot, then, is the first principle, and, as it were, the soul of a tragedy: Character holds the second place.</div><div class="sentence"> A similar fact is seen in painting.</div><div class="sentence"> The most beautiful colours, laid on confusedly, will not give as much pleasure as the chalk outline of a portrait.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus Tragedy is the imitation of an action, and of the agents mainly with a view to the action.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  Third in order is Thought,—that is, the faculty of saying what is possible and pertinent in given circumstances.</div><div class="sentence"> In the case of oratory, this is the function of the Political art and of the art of rhetoric: and so indeed the older poets make their characters speak the language of civic life; the poets of our time, the language of the rhetoricians.</div><div class="sentence"> Character is that which reveals moral purpose, showing what kind of things a man chooses or avoids.</div><div class="sentence"> Speeches, therefore, which do not make this manifest, or in which the speaker does not choose or avoid anything whatever, are not expressive of character.</div><div class="sentence"> Thought, on the other hand, is found where something is proved to be, or not to be, or a general maxim is enunciated.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  Fourth among the elements enumerated comes Diction; by which I mean, as has been already said, the expression of the meaning in words; and its essence is the same both in verse and prose.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span> <div class="sentence">  Of the remaining elements Song holds the chief place among the embellishments.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span> <div class="sentence">  The Spectacle has, indeed, an emotional attraction of its own, but, of all the parts, it is the least artistic, and connected least with the art of poetry.</div><div class="sentence"> For the power of Tragedy, we may be sure, is felt even apart from representation and actors.</div><div class="sentence"> Besides, the production of spectacular effects depends more on the art of the stage machinist than on that of the poet.</div></div>

</div><div id="link2H_4_0009" class="book_section">
<h2>VII</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  These principles being established, let us now discuss the proper structure of the Plot, since this is the first and most important thing in Tragedy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Now, according to our definition, Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is complete, and whole, and of a certain magnitude; for there may be a whole that is wanting in magnitude.</div><div class="sentence"> A whole is that which has a beginning, a middle, and an end.</div><div class="sentence"> A beginning is that which does not itself follow anything by causal necessity, but after which something naturally is or comes to be.</div><div class="sentence"> An end, on the contrary, is that which itself naturally follows some other thing, either by necessity, or as a rule, but has nothing following it.</div><div class="sentence"> A middle is that which follows something as some other thing follows it.</div><div class="sentence"> A well constructed plot, therefore, must neither begin nor end at haphazard, but conform to these principles.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, a beautiful object, whether it be a living organism or any whole composed of parts, must not only have an orderly arrangement of parts, but must also be of a certain magnitude; for beauty depends on magnitude and order.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence a very small animal organism cannot be beautiful; for the view of it is confused, the object being seen in an almost imperceptible moment of time.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor, again, can one of vast size be beautiful; for as the eye cannot take it all in at once, the unity and sense of the whole is lost for the spectator; as for instance if there were one a thousand miles long.</div><div class="sentence"> As, therefore, in the case of animate bodies and organisms a certain magnitude is necessary, and a magnitude which may be easily embraced in one view; so in the plot, a certain length is necessary, and a length which can be easily embraced by the memory.</div><div class="sentence"> The limit of length in relation to dramatic competition and sensuous presentment, is no part of artistic theory.</div><div class="sentence"> For had it been the rule for a hundred tragedies to compete together, the performance would have been regulated by the water-clock,—as indeed we are told was formerly done.</div><div class="sentence"> But the limit as fixed by the nature of the drama itself is this: the greater the length, the more beautiful will the piece be by reason of its size, provided that the whole be perspicuous.</div><div class="sentence"> And to define the matter roughly, we may say that the proper magnitude is comprised within such limits, that the sequence of events, according to the law of probability or necessity, will admit of a change from bad fortune to good, or from good fortune to bad.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  Unity of plot does not, as some persons think, consist in the Unity of the hero.</div><div class="sentence"> For infinitely various are the incidents in one man's life which cannot be reduced to unity; and so, too, there are many actions of one man out of which we cannot make one action.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence, the error, as it appears, of all poets who have composed a Heracleid, a Theseid, or other poems of the kind.</div><div class="sentence"> They imagine that as Heracles was one man, the story of Heracles must also be a unity.</div><div class="sentence"> But Homer, as in all else he is of surpassing merit, here too—whether from art or natural genius—seems to have happily discerned the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> In composing the Odyssey he did not include all the adventures of Odysseus—such as his wound on Parnassus, or his feigned madness at the mustering of the host—incidents between which there was no necessary or probable connection: but he made the Odyssey, and likewise the Iliad, to centre round an action that in our sense of the word is one.</div><div class="sentence"> As therefore, in the other imitative arts, the imitation is one when the object imitated is one, so the plot, being an imitation of an action, must imitate one action and that a whole, the structural union of the parts being such that, if any one of them is displaced or removed, the whole will be disjointed and disturbed.</div><div class="sentence"> For a thing whose presence or absence makes no visible difference, is not an organic part of the whole.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  It is, moreover, evident from what has been said, that it is not the function of the poet to relate what has happened, but what may happen,—what is possible according to the law of probability or necessity.</div><div class="sentence"> The poet and the historian differ not by writing in verse or in prose.</div><div class="sentence"> The work of Herodotus might be put into verse, and it would still be a species of history, with metre no less than without it.</div><div class="sentence"> The true difference is that one relates what has happened, the other what may happen.</div><div class="sentence"> Poetry, therefore, is a more philosophical and a higher thing than history: for poetry tends to express the universal, history the particular.</div><div class="sentence"> By the universal, I mean how a person of a certain type will on occasion speak or act, according to the law of probability or necessity; and it is this universality at which poetry aims in the names she attaches to the personages.</div><div class="sentence"> The particular is—for example—what Alcibiades did or suffered.</div><div class="sentence"> In Comedy this is already apparent: for here the poet first constructs the plot on the lines of probability, and then inserts characteristic names;—unlike the lampooners who write about particular individuals.</div><div class="sentence"> But tragedians still keep to real names, the reason being that what is possible is credible: what has not happened we do not at once feel sure to be possible: but what has happened is manifestly possible: otherwise it would not have happened.</div><div class="sentence"> Still there are even some tragedies in which there are only one or two well known names, the rest being fictitious.</div><div class="sentence"> In others, none are well known, as in Agathon's Antheus, where incidents and names alike are fictitious, and yet they give none the less pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> We must not, therefore, at all costs keep to the received legends, which are the usual subjects of Tragedy.</div><div class="sentence"> Indeed, it would be absurd to attempt it; for even subjects that are known are known only to a few, and yet give pleasure to all.</div><div class="sentence"> It clearly follows that the poet or 'maker' should be the maker of plots rather than of verses; since he is a poet because he imitates, and what he imitates are actions.</div><div class="sentence"> And even if he chances to take an historical subject, he is none the less a poet; for there is no reason why some events that have actually happened should not conform to the law of the probable and possible, and in virtue of that quality in them he is their poet or maker.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Of all plots and actions the epeisodic are the worst.</div><div class="sentence"> I call a plot 'epeisodic' in which the episodes or acts succeed one another without probable or necessary sequence.</div><div class="sentence"> Bad poets compose such pieces by their own fault, good poets, to please the players; for, as they write show pieces for competition, they stretch the plot beyond its capacity, and are often forced to break the natural continuity.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  But again, Tragedy is an imitation not only of a complete action, but of events inspiring fear or pity.</div><div class="sentence"> Such an effect is best produced when the events come on us by surprise; and the effect is heightened when, at the same time, they follow as cause and effect.</div><div class="sentence"> The tragic wonder will thee be greater than if they happened of themselves or by accident; for even coincidences are most striking when they have an air of design.</div><div class="sentence"> We may instance the statue of Mitys at Argos, which fell upon his murderer while he was a spectator at a festival, and killed him.</div><div class="sentence"> Such events seem not to be due to mere chance.</div><div class="sentence"> Plots, therefore, constructed on these principles are necessarily the best.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  As the sequel to what has already been said, we must proceed to consider what the poet should aim at, and what he should avoid, in constructing his plots; and by what means the specific effect of Tragedy will be produced.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan.</div><div class="sentence"> It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.</div><div class="sentence"> It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change, of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor, again, that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity: for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it possesses no single tragic quality; it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor, again, should the downfall of the utter villain be exhibited.</div><div class="sentence"> A plot of this kind would, doubtless, satisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves.</div><div class="sentence"> Such an event, therefore, will be neither pitiful nor terrible.</div><div class="sentence"> There remains, then, the character between these two extremes,—that of a man who is not eminently good and just,-yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error or frailty.</div><div class="sentence"> He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous,—a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  A well constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.</div><div class="sentence"> The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.</div><div class="sentence"> It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.</div><div class="sentence"> The practice of the stage bears out our view.</div><div class="sentence"> At first the poets recounted any legend that came in their way.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses, on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible.</div><div class="sentence"> A tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art should be of this construction.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence they are in error who censure Euripides just because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily.</div><div class="sentence"> It is, as we have said, the right ending.</div><div class="sentence"> The best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competition, such plays, if well worked out, are the most tragic in effect; and Euripides, faulty though he may be in the general management of his subject, yet is felt to be the most tragic of the poets.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first.</div><div class="sentence"> Like the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and for the bad.</div><div class="sentence"> It is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators; for the poet is guided in what he writes by the wishes of his audience.</div><div class="sentence"> The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies—like Orestes and Aegisthus—quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain.</div></div>

<h2>XIV</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  Fear and pity may be aroused by spectacular means; but they may also result from the inner structure of the piece, which is the better way, and indicates a superior poet.</div><div class="sentence"> For the plot ought to be so constructed that, even without the aid of the eye, he who hears the tale told will thrill with horror and melt to pity at what takes place.</div><div class="sentence"> This is the impression we should receive from hearing the story of the Oedipus.</div><div class="sentence"> But to produce this effect by the mere spectacle is a less artistic method, and dependent on extraneous aids.</div><div class="sentence"> Those who employ spectacular means to create a sense not of the terrible but only of the monstrous, are strangers to the purpose of Tragedy; for we must not demand of Tragedy any and every kind of pleasure, but only that which is proper to it.</div><div class="sentence"> And since the pleasure which the poet should afford is that which comes from pity and fear through imitation, it is evident that this quality must be impressed upon the incidents.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Let us then determine what are the circumstances which strike us as terrible or pitiful.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Actions capable of this effect must happen between persons who are either friends or enemies or indifferent to one another.</div><div class="sentence"> If an enemy kills an enemy, there is nothing to excite pity either in the act or the intention,—except so far as the suffering in itself is pitiful.</div><div class="sentence"> So again with indifferent persons.</div><div class="sentence"> But when the tragic incident occurs between those who are near or dear to one another—if, for example, a brother kills, or intends to kill, a brother, a son his father, a mother her son, a son his mother, or any other deed of the kind is done—these are the situations to be looked for by the poet.</div><div class="sentence"> He may not indeed destroy the framework of the received legends—the fact, for instance, that Clytemnestra was slain by Orestes and Eriphyle by Alcmaeon but he ought to show invention of his own, and skilfully handle the traditional material.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us explain more clearly what is meant by skilful handling.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  The action may be done consciously and with knowledge of the persons, in the manner of the older poets.</div><div class="sentence"> It is thus too that Euripides makes Medea slay her children.</div><div class="sentence"> Or, again, the deed of horror may be done, but done in ignorance, and the tie of kinship or friendship be discovered afterwards.</div><div class="sentence"> The Oedipus of Sophocles is an example.</div><div class="sentence"> Here, indeed, the incident is outside the drama proper; but cases occur where it falls within the action of the play: one may cite the Alcmaeon of Astydamas, or Telegonus in the Wounded Odysseus.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, there is a third case,— (to be about to act with knowledge of the persons and then not to act.</div><div class="sentence"> The fourth case is) when some one is about to do an irreparable deed through ignorance, and makes the discovery before it is done.</div><div class="sentence"> These are the only possible ways.</div><div class="sentence"> For the deed must either be done or not done,—and that wittingly or unwittingly.</div><div class="sentence"> But of all these ways, to be about to act knowing the persons, and then not to act, is the worst.</div><div class="sentence"> It is shocking without being tragic, for no disaster follows.</div><div class="sentence"> It is, therefore, never, or very rarely, found in poetry.</div><div class="sentence"> One instance, however, is in the Antigone, where Haemon threatens to kill Creon.</div><div class="sentence"> The next and better way is that the deed should be perpetrated.</div><div class="sentence"> Still better, that it should be perpetrated in ignorance, and the discovery made afterwards.</div><div class="sentence"> There is then nothing to shock us, while the discovery produces a startling effect.</div><div class="sentence"> The last case is the best, as when in the Cresphontes Merope is about to slay her son, but, recognising who he is, spares his life.</div><div class="sentence"> So in the Iphigenia, the sister recognises the brother just in time.</div><div class="sentence"> Again in the Helle, the son recognises the mother when on the point of giving her up.</div><div class="sentence"> This, then, is why a few families only, as has been already observed, furnish the subjects of tragedy.</div><div class="sentence"> It was not art, but happy chance, that led the poets in search of subjects to impress the tragic quality upon their plots.</div><div class="sentence"> They are compelled, therefore, to have recourse to those houses whose history contains moving incidents like these.</div></div>

<h2>XV</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  In respect of Character there are four things to be aimed at.</div><div class="sentence"> First, and most important, it must be good.</div><div class="sentence"> Now any speech or action that manifests moral purpose of any kind will be expressive of character: the character will be good if the purpose is good.</div><div class="sentence"> This rule is relative to each class.</div><div class="sentence"> Even a woman may be good, and also a slave; though the woman may be said to be an inferior being, and the slave quite worthless.</div><div class="sentence"> The second thing to aim at is propriety.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a type of manly valour; but valour in a woman, or unscrupulous cleverness, is inappropriate.</div><div class="sentence"> Thirdly, character must be true to life: for this is a distinct thing from goodness and propriety, as here described.</div><div class="sentence"> The fourth point is consistency: for though the subject of the imitation, who suggested the type, be inconsistent, still he must be consistently inconsistent.</div><div class="sentence"> As an example of motiveless degradation of character, we have Menelaus in the Orestes: of character indecorous and inappropriate, the lament of Odysseus in the Scylla, and the speech of Melanippe: of inconsistency, the Iphigenia at Aulis,—for Iphigenia the suppliant in no way resembles her later self.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  As in the structure of the plot, so too in the portraiture of character, the poet should always aim either at the necessary or the probable.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus a person of a given character should speak or act in a given way, by the rule either of necessity or of probability; just as this event should follow that by necessary or probable sequence.</div><div class="sentence"> It is therefore evident that the unravelling of the plot, no less than the complication, must arise out of the plot itself, it must not be brought about by the 'Deus ex Machina'—as in the Medea, or in the Return of the Greeks in the Iliad.</div><div class="sentence"> The 'Deus ex Machina' should be employed only for events external to the drama,—for antecedent or subsequent events, which lie beyond the range of human knowledge, and which require to be reported or foretold; for to the gods we ascribe the power of seeing all things.</div><div class="sentence"> Within the action there must be nothing irrational.</div><div class="sentence"> If the irrational cannot be excluded, it should be outside the scope of the tragedy.</div><div class="sentence"> Such is the irrational element in the Oedipus of Sophocles.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, since Tragedy is an imitation of persons who are above the common level, the example of good portrait-painters should be followed.</div><div class="sentence"> They, while reproducing the distinctive form of the original, make a likeness which is true to life and yet more beautiful.</div><div class="sentence"> So too the poet, in representing men who are irascible or indolent, or have other defects of character, should preserve the type and yet ennoble it.</div><div class="sentence"> In this way Achilles is portrayed by Agathon and Homer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  These then are rules the poet should observe.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor should he neglect those appeals to the senses, which, though not among the essentials, are the concomitants of poetry; for here too there is much room for error.</div><div class="sentence"> But of this enough has been said in our published treatises.</div></div>

</div><div id="link2H_4_0018" class="book_section">
<h2>XVI</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  What Recognition is has been already explained.</div><div class="sentence"> We will now enumerate its kinds.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  First, the least artistic form, which, from poverty of wit, is most commonly employed recognition by signs.</div><div class="sentence"> Of these some are congenital,—such as 'the spear which the earth-born race bear on their bodies,' or the stars introduced by Carcinus in his Thyestes.</div><div class="sentence"> Others are acquired after birth; and of these some are bodily marks, as scars; some external tokens, as necklaces, or the little ark in the Tyro by which the discovery is effected.</div><div class="sentence"> Even these admit of more or less skilful treatment.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus in the recognition of Odysseus by his scar, the discovery is made in one way by the nurse, in another by the swineherds.</div><div class="sentence"> The use of tokens for the express purpose of proof—and, indeed, any formal proof with or without tokens—is a less artistic mode of recognition.</div><div class="sentence"> A better kind is that which comes about by a turn of incident, as in the Bath Scene in the Odyssey.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Next come the recognitions invented at will by the poet, and on that account wanting in art.</div><div class="sentence"> For example, Orestes in the Iphigenia reveals the fact that he is Orestes.</div><div class="sentence"> She, indeed, makes herself known by the letter; but he, by speaking himself, and saying what the poet, not what the plot requires.</div><div class="sentence"> This, therefore, is nearly allied to the fault above mentioned:—for Orestes might as well have brought tokens with him.</div><div class="sentence"> Another similar instance is the 'voice of the shuttle' in the Tereus of Sophocles.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  The third kind depends on memory when the sight of some object awakens a feeling: as in the Cyprians of Dicaeogenes, where the hero breaks into tears on seeing the picture; or again in the 'Lay of Alcinous,' where Odysseus, hearing the minstrel play the lyre, recalls the past and weeps; and hence the recognition.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  The fourth kind is by process of reasoning.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus in the Choephori: 'Some one resembling me has come: no one resembles me but Orestes: therefore Orestes has come.'</div><div class="sentence"> Such too is the discovery made by Iphigenia in the play of Polyidus the Sophist.</div><div class="sentence"> It was a natural reflection for Orestes to make, 'So I too must die at the altar like my sister.'</div><div class="sentence"> So, again, in the Tydeus of Theodectes, the father says, 'I came to find my son, and I lose my own life.'</div><div class="sentence"> So too in the Phineidae: the women, on seeing the place, inferred their fate:—'Here we are doomed to die, for here we were cast forth.'</div><div class="sentence"> Again, there is a composite kind of recognition involving false inference on the part of one of the characters, as in the Odysseus Disguised as a Messenger.</div><div class="sentence"> A said (that no one else was able to bend the bow;... hence B (the disguised Odysseus) imagined that A would) recognise the bow which, in fact, he had not seen; and to bring about a recognition by this means that the expectation A would recognise the bow is false inference.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  But, of all recognitions, the best is that which arises from the incidents themselves, where the startling discovery is made by natural means.</div><div class="sentence"> Such is that in the Oedipus of Sophocles, and in the Iphigenia; for it was natural that Iphigenia should wish to dispatch a letter.</div><div class="sentence"> These recognitions alone dispense with the artificial aid of tokens or amulets.</div><div class="sentence"> Next come the recognitions by process of reasoning.</div></div>

</div><div id="link2H_4_0019" class="book_section">
<h2>XVII</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  In constructing the plot and working it out with the proper diction, the poet should place the scene, as far as possible, before his eyes.</div><div class="sentence"> In this way, seeing everything with the utmost vividness, as if he were a spectator of the action, he will discover what is in keeping with it, and be most unlikely to overlook inconsistencies.</div><div class="sentence"> The need of such a rule is shown by the fault found in Carcinus.</div><div class="sentence"> Amphiaraus was on his way from the temple.</div><div class="sentence"> This fact escaped the observation of one who did not see the situation.</div><div class="sentence"> On the stage, however, the piece failed, the audience being offended at the oversight.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, the poet should work out his play, to the best of his power, with appropriate gestures; for those who feel emotion are most convincing through natural sympathy with the characters they represent; and one who is agitated storms, one who is angry rages, with the most life-like reality.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence poetry implies either a happy gift of nature or a strain of madness.</div><div class="sentence"> In the one case a man can take the mould of any character; in the other, he is lifted out of his proper self.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  As for the story, whether the poet takes it ready made or constructs it for himself, he should first sketch its general outline, and then fill in the episodes and amplify in detail.</div><div class="sentence"> The general plan may be illustrated by the Iphigenia.</div><div class="sentence"> A young girl is sacrificed; she disappears mysteriously from the eyes of those who sacrificed her; She is transported to another country, where the custom is to offer up all strangers to the goddess.</div><div class="sentence"> To this ministry she is appointed.</div><div class="sentence"> Some time later her own brother chances to arrive.</div><div class="sentence"> The fact that the oracle for some reason ordered him to go there, is outside the general plan of the play.</div><div class="sentence"> The purpose, again, of his coming is outside the action proper.</div><div class="sentence"> However, he comes, he is seized, and, when on the point of being sacrificed, reveals who he is.</div><div class="sentence"> The mode of recognition may be either that of Euripides or of Polyidus, in whose play he exclaims very naturally:—'So it was not my sister only, but I too, who was doomed to be sacrificed'; and by that remark he is saved.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  After this, the names being once given, it remains to fill in the episodes.</div><div class="sentence"> We must see that they are relevant to the action.</div><div class="sentence"> In the case of Orestes, for example, there is the madness which led to his capture, and his deliverance by means of the purificatory rite.</div><div class="sentence"> In the drama, the episodes are short, but it is these that give extension to Epic poetry.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus the story of the Odyssey can be stated briefly.</div><div class="sentence"> A certain man is absent from home for many years; he is jealously watched by Poseidon, and left desolate.</div><div class="sentence"> Meanwhile his home is in a wretched plight—suitors are wasting his substance and plotting against his son.</div><div class="sentence"> At length, tempest-tost, he himself arrives; he makes certain persons acquainted with him; he attacks the suitors with his own hand, and is himself preserved while he destroys them.</div><div class="sentence"> This is the essence of the plot; the rest is episode.</div></div>

</div><div id="link2H_4_0020" class="book_section">

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  Every tragedy falls into two parts,—Complication and Unravelling or Denouement.</div><div class="sentence"> Incidents extraneous to the action are frequently combined with a portion of the action proper, to form the Complication; the rest is the Unravelling.</div><div class="sentence"> By the Complication I mean all that extends from the beginning of the action to the part which marks the turning-point to good or bad fortune.</div><div class="sentence"> The Unravelling is that which extends from the beginning of the change to the end.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus, in the Lynceus of Theodectes, the Complication consists of the incidents presupposed in the drama, the seizure of the child, and then again, The Unravelling extends from the accusation of murder to the end.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  There are four kinds of Tragedy, the Complex, depending entirely on Reversal of the Situation and Recognition; the Pathetic (where the motive is passion),—such as the tragedies on Ajax and Ixion; the Ethical (where the motives are ethical),—such as the Phthiotides and the Peleus.</div><div class="sentence"> The fourth kind is the Simple (We here exclude the purely spectacular element), exemplified by the Phorcides, the Prometheus, and scenes laid in Hades.</div><div class="sentence"> The poet should endeavour, if possible, to combine all poetic elements; or failing that, the greatest number and those the most important; the more so, in face of the cavilling criticism of the day.</div><div class="sentence"> For whereas there have hitherto been good poets, each in his own branch, the critics now expect one man to surpass all others in their several lines of excellence.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  In speaking of a tragedy as the same or different, the best test to take is the plot.</div><div class="sentence"> Identity exists where the Complication and Unravelling are the same.</div><div class="sentence"> Many poets tie the knot well, but unravel it ill.</div><div class="sentence"> Both arts, however, should always be mastered.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, the poet should remember what has been often said, and not make an Epic structure into a Tragedy—by an Epic structure I mean one with a multiplicity of plots—as if, for instance, you were to make a tragedy out of the entire story of the Iliad.</div><div class="sentence"> In the Epic poem, owing to its length, each part assumes its proper magnitude.</div><div class="sentence"> In the drama the result is far from answering to the poet's expectation.</div><div class="sentence"> The proof is that the poets who have dramatised the whole story of the Fall of Troy, instead of selecting portions, like Euripides; or who have taken the whole tale of Niobe, and not a part of her story, like Aeschylus, either fail utterly or meet with poor success on the stage.</div><div class="sentence"> Even Agathon has been known to fail from this one defect.</div><div class="sentence"> In his Reversals of the Situation, however, he shows a marvellous skill in the effort to hit the popular taste,—to produce a tragic effect that satisfies the moral sense.</div><div class="sentence"> This effect is produced when the clever rogue, like Sisyphus, is outwitted, or the brave villain defeated.</div><div class="sentence"> Such an event is probable in Agathon's sense of the word: 'it is probable,' he says, 'that many things should happen contrary to probability.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  The Chorus too should be regarded as one of the actors; it should be an integral part of the whole, and share in the action, in the manner not of Euripides but of Sophocles.</div><div class="sentence"> As for the later poets, their choral songs pertain as little to the subject of the piece as to that of any other tragedy.</div><div class="sentence"> They are, therefore, sung as mere interludes, a practice first begun by Agathon.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet what difference is there between introducing such choral interludes, and transferring a speech, or even a whole act, from one play to another?</div></div>

A mute, that which with such impact has by itself no sound, but joined to a vowel sound becomes audible, as G and D. These are distinguished according to the form assumed by the mouth and the place where they are produced; according as they are aspirated or smooth, long or short; as they are acute, grave, or of an intermediate tone; which inquiry belongs in detail to the writers on metre.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  A Syllable is a non-significant sound, composed of a mute and a vowel: for GR without A is a syllable, as also with A,—GRA.</div><div class="sentence"> But the investigation of these differences belongs also to metrical science.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  A Noun is a composite significant sound, not marking time, of which no part is in itself significant: for in double or compound words we do not employ the separate parts as if each were in itself significant.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus in Theodorus, 'god-given,' the {delta omega rho omicron nu} or 'gift' is not in itself significant.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  A Verb is a composite significant sound, marking time, in which, as in the noun, no part is in itself significant.</div><div class="sentence"> For 'man,' or 'white' does not express the idea of 'when'; but 'he walks,' or 'he has walked' does connote time, present or past.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  Inflexion belongs both to the noun and verb, and expresses either the relation 'of,' 'to,' or the like; or that of number, whether one or many, as 'man' or 'men '; or the modes or tones in actual delivery, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> a question or a command.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Did he go?'</div><div class="sentence"> and 'go' are verbal inflexions of this kind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  A Sentence or Phrase is a composite significant sound, some at least of whose parts are in themselves significant; for not every such group of words consists of verbs and nouns—'the definition of man,' for example—but it may dispense even with the verb.</div><div class="sentence"> Still it will always have some significant part, as 'in walking,' or 'Cleon son of Cleon.'</div><div class="sentence"> A sentence or phrase may form a unity in two ways,—either as signifying one thing, or as consisting of several parts linked together.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus the Iliad is one by the linking together of parts, the definition of man by the unity of the thing signified.]</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Epic poetry has, however, a great—a special—capacity for enlarging its dimensions, and we can see the reason.</div><div class="sentence"> In Tragedy we cannot imitate several lines of actions carried on at one and the same time; we must confine ourselves to the action on the stage and the part taken by the players.</div><div class="sentence"> But in Epic poetry, owing to the narrative form, many events simultaneously transacted can be presented; and these, if relevant to the subject, add mass and dignity to the poem.</div><div class="sentence"> The Epic has here an advantage, and one that conduces to grandeur of effect, to diverting the mind of the hearer, and relieving the story with varying episodes.</div><div class="sentence"> For sameness of incident soon produces satiety, and makes tragedies fail on the stage.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  Homer, admirable in all respects, has the special merit of being the only poet who rightly appreciates the part he should take himself.</div><div class="sentence"> The poet should speak as little as possible in his own person, for it is not this that makes him an imitator.</div><div class="sentence"> Other poets appear themselves upon the scene throughout, and imitate but little and rarely.</div><div class="sentence"> Homer, after a few prefatory words, at once brings in a man, or woman, or other personage; none of them wanting in characteristic qualities, but each with a character of his own.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  The element of the wonderful is required in Tragedy.</div><div class="sentence"> The irrational, on which the wonderful depends for its chief effects, has wider scope in Epic poetry, because there the person acting is not seen.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus, the pursuit of Hector would be ludicrous if placed upon the stage—the Greeks standing still and not joining in the pursuit, and Achilles waving them back.</div><div class="sentence"> But in the Epic poem the absurdity passes unnoticed.</div><div class="sentence"> Now the wonderful is pleasing: as may be inferred from the fact that every one tells a story with some addition of his own, knowing that his hearers like it.</div><div class="sentence"> It is Homer who has chiefly taught other poets the art of telling lies skilfully.</div><div class="sentence"> The secret of it lies in a fallacy, For, assuming that if one thing is or becomes, a second is or becomes, men imagine that, if the second is, the first likewise is or becomes.</div><div class="sentence"> But this is a false inference.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence, where the first thing is untrue, it is quite unnecessary, provided the second be true, to add that the first is or has become.</div><div class="sentence"> For the mind, knowing the second to be true, falsely infers the truth of the first.</div><div class="sentence"> There is an example of this in the Bath Scene of the Odyssey.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  Accordingly, the poet should prefer probable impossibilities to improbable possibilities.</div><div class="sentence"> The tragic plot must not be composed of irrational parts.</div><div class="sentence"> Everything irrational should, if possible, be excluded; or, at all events, it should lie outside the action of the play (as, in the Oedipus, the hero's ignorance as to the manner of Laius' death); not within the drama,—as in the Electra, the messenger's account of the Pythian games; or, as in the Mysians, the man who has come from Tegea to Mysia and is still speechless.</div><div class="sentence"> The plea that otherwise the plot would have been ruined, is ridiculous; such a plot should not in the first instance be constructed.</div><div class="sentence"> But once the irrational has been introduced and an air of likelihood imparted to it, we must accept it in spite of the absurdity.</div><div class="sentence"> Take even the irrational incidents in the Odyssey, where Odysseus is left upon the shore of Ithaca.</div><div class="sentence"> How intolerable even these might have been would be apparent if an inferior poet were to treat the subject.</div><div class="sentence"> As it is, the absurdity is veiled by the poetic charm with which the poet invests it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  The diction should be elaborated in the pauses of the action, where there is no expression of character or thought.</div><div class="sentence"> For, conversely, character and thought are merely obscured by a diction that is over brilliant.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  With respect to critical difficulties and their solutions, the number and nature of the sources from which they may be drawn may be thus exhibited.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  The poet being an imitator, like a painter or any other artist, must of necessity imitate one of three objects,—things as they were or are, things as they are said or thought to be, or things as they ought to be.</div><div class="sentence"> The vehicle of expression is language,—either current terms or, it may be, rare words or metaphors.</div><div class="sentence"> There are also many modifications of language, which we concede to the poets.</div><div class="sentence"> Add to this, that the standard of correctness is not the same in poetry and politics, any more than in poetry and any other art.</div><div class="sentence"> Within the art of poetry itself there are two kinds of faults, those which touch its essence, and those which are accidental.</div><div class="sentence"> If a poet has chosen to imitate something, (but has imitated it incorrectly) through want of capacity, the error is inherent in the poetry.</div><div class="sentence"> But if the failure is due to a wrong choice if he has represented a horse as throwing out both his off legs at once, or introduced technical inaccuracies in medicine, for example, or in any other art the error is not essential to the poetry.</div><div class="sentence"> These are the points of view from which we should consider and answer the objections raised by the critics.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  First as to matters which concern the poet's own art.</div><div class="sentence"> If he describes the impossible, he is guilty of an error; but the error may be justified, if the end of the art be thereby attained (the end being that already mentioned), if, that is, the effect of this or any other part of the poem is thus rendered more striking.</div><div class="sentence"> A case in point is the pursuit of Hector.</div><div class="sentence"> If, however, the end might have been as well, or better, attained without violating the special rules of the poetic art, the error is not justified: for every kind of error should, if possible, be avoided.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, does the error touch the essentials of the poetic art, or some accident of it?</div><div class="sentence"> For example,—not to know that a hind has no horns is a less serious matter than to paint it inartistically.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  Further, if it be objected that the description is not true to fact, the poet may perhaps reply,—'But the objects are as they ought to be': just as Sophocles said that he drew men as they ought to be; Euripides, as they are.</div><div class="sentence"> In this way the objection may be met.</div><div class="sentence"> If, however, the representation be of neither kind, the poet may answer,—This is how men say the thing is.'</div><div class="sentence"> This applies to tales about the gods.</div><div class="sentence"> It may well be that these stories are not higher than fact nor yet true to fact: they are, very possibly, what Xenophanes says of them.</div><div class="sentence"> But anyhow, 'this is what is said.'</div><div class="sentence"> Again, a description may be no better than the fact: 'still, it was the fact'; as in the passage about the arms: 'Upright upon their butt-ends stood the spears.'</div><div class="sentence"> This was the custom then, as it now is among the Illyrians.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, in examining whether what has been said or done by some one is poetically right or not, we must not look merely to the particular act or saying, and ask whether it is poetically good or bad.</div><div class="sentence"> We must also consider by whom it is said or done, to whom, when, by what means, or for what end; whether, for instance, it be to secure a greater good, or avert a greater evil.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  Other difficulties may be resolved by due regard to the usage of language.</div><div class="sentence"> We may note a rare word, as in {omicron upsilon rho eta alpha sigma / mu epsilon nu / pi rho omega tau omicron nu}, where the poet perhaps employs {omicron upsilon rho eta alpha sigma} not in the sense of mules, but of sentinels.</div><div class="sentence"> So, again, of Dolon: 'ill-favoured indeed he was to look upon.'</div><div class="sentence"> It is not meant that his body was ill-shaped, but that his face was ugly; for the Cretans use the word {epsilon upsilon epsilon iota delta epsilon sigma}, 'well-favoured,' to denote a fair face.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, {zeta omega rho omicron tau epsilon rho omicron nu / delta epsilon / kappa epsilon rho alpha iota epsilon}, 'mix the drink livelier,' does not mean `mix it stronger' as for hard drinkers, but 'mix it quicker.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  Sometimes an expression is metaphorical, as 'Now all gods and men were sleeping through the night,'—while at the same time the poet says: 'Often indeed as he turned his gaze to the Trojan plain, he marvelled at the sound of flutes and pipes.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'All' is here used metaphorically for 'many,' all being a species of many.</div><div class="sentence"> So in the verse,—'alone she hath no part...,' {omicron iota eta}, 'alone,' is metaphorical; for the best known may be called the only one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, the solution may depend upon accent or breathing.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus Hippias of Thasos solved the difficulties in the lines,—{delta iota delta omicron mu epsilon nu (delta iota delta omicron mu epsilon nu) delta epsilon / omicron iota,} and { tau omicron / mu epsilon nu / omicron upsilon (omicron upsilon) kappa alpha tau alpha pi upsilon theta epsilon tau alpha iota / omicron mu beta rho omega}.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span> <div class="sentence">  Or again, the question may be solved by punctuation, as in Empedocles,—'Of a sudden things became mortal that before had learnt to be immortal, and things unmixed before mixed.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span> <div class="sentence">  Or again, by ambiguity of meaning,—as {pi alpha rho omega chi eta kappa epsilon nu / delta epsilon / pi lambda epsilon omega / nu upsilon xi}, where the word {pi lambda epsilon omega} is ambiguous.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span> <div class="sentence">  Or by the usage of language.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus any mixed drink is called {omicron iota nu omicron sigma}, 'wine.'</div><div class="sentence"> Hence Ganymede is said 'to pour the wine to Zeus,' though the gods do not drink wine.</div><div class="sentence"> So too workers in iron are called {chi alpha lambda kappa epsilon alpha sigma}, or workers in bronze.</div><div class="sentence"> This, however, may also be taken as a metaphor.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, when a word seems to involve some inconsistency of meaning, we should consider how many senses it may bear in the particular passage.</div><div class="sentence"> For example: 'there was stayed the spear of bronze'—we should ask in how many ways we may take 'being checked there.'</div><div class="sentence"> The true mode of interpretation is the precise opposite of what Glaucon mentions.</div><div class="sentence"> Critics, he says, jump at certain groundless conclusions; they pass adverse judgment and then proceed to reason on it; and, assuming that the poet has said whatever they happen to think, find fault if a thing is inconsistent with their own fancy.</div><div class="sentence"> The question about Icarius has been treated in this fashion.</div><div class="sentence"> The critics imagine he was a Lacedaemonian.</div><div class="sentence"> They think it strange, therefore, that Telemachus should not have met him when he went to Lacedaemon.</div><div class="sentence"> But the Cephallenian story may perhaps be the true one.</div><div class="sentence"> They allege that Odysseus took a wife from among themselves, and that her father was Icadius not Icarius.</div><div class="sentence"> It is merely a mistake, then, that gives plausibility to the objection.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span> <div class="sentence">  In general, the impossible must be justified by reference to artistic requirements, or to the higher reality, or to received opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> With respect to the requirements of art, a probable impossibility is to be preferred to a thing improbable and yet possible.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, it may be impossible that there should be men such as Zeuxis painted.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Yes,' we say, 'but the impossible is the higher thing; for the ideal type must surpass the reality.'</div><div class="sentence"> To justify the irrational, we appeal to what is commonly said to be.</div><div class="sentence"> In addition to which, we urge that the irrational sometimes does not violate reason; just as 'it is probable that a thing may happen contrary to probability.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span> <div class="sentence">  Things that sound contradictory should be examined by the same rules as in dialectical refutation whether the same thing is meant, in the same relation, and in the same sense.</div><div class="sentence"> We should therefore solve the question by reference to what the poet says himself, or to what is tacitly assumed by a person of intelligence.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span> <div class="sentence">  The element of the irrational, and, similarly, depravity of character, are justly censured when there is no inner necessity for introducing them.</div><div class="sentence"> Such is the irrational element in the introduction of Aegeus by Euripides and the badness of Menelaus in the Orestes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span> <div class="sentence">  Thus, there are five sources from which critical objections are drawn.</div><div class="sentence"> Things are censured either as impossible, or irrational, or morally hurtful, or contradictory, or contrary to artistic correctness.</div><div class="sentence"> The answers should be sought under the twelve heads above mentioned.</div></div>

</div><div id="link2H_4_0028" class="book_section">
<h2>XXVI</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  The question may be raised whether the Epic or Tragic mode of imitation is the higher.</div><div class="sentence"> If the more refined art is the higher, and the more refined in every case is that which appeals to the better sort of audience, the art which imitates anything and everything is manifestly most unrefined.</div><div class="sentence"> The audience is supposed to be too dull to comprehend unless something of their own is thrown in by the performers, who therefore indulge in restless movements.</div><div class="sentence"> Bad flute-players twist and twirl, if they have to represent 'the quoit-throw,' or hustle the coryphaeus when they perform the 'Scylla.'</div><div class="sentence"> Tragedy, it is said, has this same defect.</div><div class="sentence"> We may compare the opinion that the older actors entertained of their successors.</div><div class="sentence"> Mynniscus used to call Callippides 'ape' on account of the extravagance of his action, and the same view was held of Pindarus.</div><div class="sentence"> Tragic art, then, as a whole, stands to Epic in the same relation as the younger to the elder actors.</div><div class="sentence"> So we are told that Epic poetry is addressed to a cultivated audience, who do not need gesture; Tragedy, to an inferior public.</div><div class="sentence"> Being then unrefined, it is evidently the lower of the two.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Now, in the first place, this censure attaches not to the poetic but to the histrionic art; for gesticulation may be equally overdone in epic recitation, as by Sosi-stratus, or in lyrical competition, as by Mnasitheus the Opuntian.</div><div class="sentence"> Next, all action is not to be condemned any more than all dancing—but only that of bad performers.</div><div class="sentence"> Such was the fault found in Callippides, as also in others of our own day, who are censured for representing degraded women.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, Tragedy like Epic poetry produces its effect even without action; it reveals its power by mere reading.</div><div class="sentence"> If, then, in all other respects it is superior, this fault, we say, is not inherent in it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  And superior it is, because it has all the epic elements—it may even use the epic metre—with the music and spectacular effects as important accessories; and these produce the most vivid of pleasures.</div><div class="sentence"> Further, it has vividness of impression in reading as well as in representation.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover, the art attains its end within narrower limits; for the concentrated effect is more pleasurable than one which is spread over a long time and so diluted.</div><div class="sentence"> What, for example, would be the effect of the Oedipus of Sophocles, if it were cast into a form as long as the Iliad?</div><div class="sentence"> Once more, the Epic imitation has less unity; as is shown by this, that any Epic poem will furnish subjects for several tragedies.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus if the story adopted by the poet has a strict unity, it must either be concisely told and appear truncated; or, if it conform to the Epic canon of length, it must seem weak and watery.</div><div class="sentence"> (Such length implies some loss of unity,) if, I mean, the poem is constructed out of several actions, like the Iliad and the Odyssey, which have many such parts, each with a certain magnitude of its own.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet these poems are as perfect as possible in structure; each is, in the highest degree attainable, an imitation of a single action.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  If, then, Tragedy is superior to Epic poetry in all these respects, and, moreover, fulfils its specific function better as an art for each art ought to produce, not any chance pleasure, but the pleasure proper to it, as already stated it plainly follows that Tragedy is the higher art, as attaining its end more perfectly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  Thus much may suffice concerning Tragic and Epic poetry in general; their several kinds and parts, with the number of each and their differences; the causes that make a poem good or bad; the objections of the critics and the answers to these objections.</div></div>
