<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  The Ion is the shortest, or nearly the shortest, of all the writings which bear the name of Plato, and is not authenticated by any early external testimony.</div><div class="sentence"> The grace and beauty of this little work supply the only, and perhaps a sufficient, proof of its genuineness.</div><div class="sentence"> The plan is simple; the dramatic interest consists entirely in the contrast between the irony of Socrates and the transparent vanity and childlike enthusiasm of the rhapsode Ion.</div><div class="sentence"> The theme of the Dialogue may possibly have been suggested by the passage of Xenophon's Memorabilia in which the rhapsodists are described by Euthydemus as 'very precise about the exact words of Homer, but very idiotic themselves.'</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Aristotle, Met.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Ion the rhapsode has just come to Athens; he has been exhibiting in Epidaurus at the festival of Asclepius, and is intending to exhibit at the festival of the Panathenaea.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates admires and envies the rhapsode's art; for he is always well dressed and in good company—in the company of good poets and of Homer, who is the prince of them.</div><div class="sentence"> In the course of conversation the admission is elicited from Ion that his skill is restricted to Homer, and that he knows nothing of inferior poets, such as Hesiod and Archilochus;—he brightens up and is wide awake when Homer is being recited, but is apt to go to sleep at the recitations of any other poet.</div><div class="sentence"> 'And yet, surely, he who knows the superior ought to know the inferior also;—he who can judge of the good speaker is able to judge of the bad.</div><div class="sentence"> And poetry is a whole; and he who judges of poetry by rules of art ought to be able to judge of all poetry.'</div><div class="sentence"> This is confirmed by the analogy of sculpture, painting, flute-playing, and the other arts.</div><div class="sentence"> The argument is at last brought home to the mind of Ion, who asks how this contradiction is to be solved.</div><div class="sentence"> The solution given by Socrates is as follows:—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  The rhapsode is not guided by rules of art, but is an inspired person who derives a mysterious power from the poet; and the poet, in like manner, is inspired by the God.</div><div class="sentence"> The poets and their interpreters may be compared to a chain of magnetic rings suspended from one another, and from a magnet.</div><div class="sentence"> The magnet is the Muse, and the ring which immediately follows is the poet himself; from him are suspended other poets; there is also a chain of rhapsodes and actors, who also hang from the Muses, but are let down at the side; and the last ring of all is the spectator.</div><div class="sentence"> The poet is the inspired interpreter of the God, and this is the reason why some poets, like Homer, are restricted to a single theme, or, like Tynnichus, are famous for a single poem; and the rhapsode is the inspired interpreter of the poet, and for a similar reason some rhapsodes, like Ion, are the interpreters of single poets.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  Ion is delighted at the notion of being inspired, and acknowledges that he is beside himself when he is performing;—his eyes rain tears and his hair stands on end.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates is of opinion that a man must be mad who behaves in this way at a festival when he is surrounded by his friends and there is nothing to trouble him.</div><div class="sentence"> Ion is confident that Socrates would never think him mad if he could only hear his embellishments of Homer.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates asks whether he can speak well about everything in Homer.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Yes, indeed he can.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'What about things of which he has no knowledge?'</div><div class="sentence"> Ion answers that he can interpret anything in Homer.</div><div class="sentence"> But, rejoins Socrates, when Homer speaks of the arts, as for example, of chariot-driving, or of medicine, or of prophecy, or of navigation—will he, or will the charioteer or physician or prophet or pilot be the better judge?</div><div class="sentence"> Ion is compelled to admit that every man will judge of his own particular art better than the rhapsode.</div><div class="sentence"> He still maintains, however, that he understands the art of the general as well as any one.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Then why in this city of Athens, in which men of merit are always being sought after, is he not at once appointed a general?'</div><div class="sentence"> Ion replies that he is a foreigner, and the Athenians and Spartans will not appoint a foreigner to be their general.</div><div class="sentence"> 'No, that is not the real reason; there are many examples to the contrary.</div><div class="sentence"> But Ion has long been playing tricks with the argument; like Proteus, he transforms himself into a variety of shapes, and is at last about to run away in the disguise of a general.</div><div class="sentence"> Would he rather be regarded as inspired or dishonest?'</div><div class="sentence"> Ion, who has no suspicion of the irony of Socrates, eagerly embraces the alternative of inspiration.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  The Ion, like the other earlier Platonic Dialogues, is a mixture of jest and earnest, in which no definite result is obtained, but some Socratic or Platonic truths are allowed dimly to appear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  The elements of a true theory of poetry are contained in the notion that the poet is inspired.</div><div class="sentence"> Genius is often said to be unconscious, or spontaneous, or a gift of nature: that 'genius is akin to madness' is a popular aphorism of modern times.</div><div class="sentence"> The greatest strength is observed to have an element of limitation.</div><div class="sentence"> Sense or passion are too much for the 'dry light' of intelligence which mingles with them and becomes discoloured by them.</div><div class="sentence"> Imagination is often at war with reason and fact.</div><div class="sentence"> The concentration of the mind on a single object, or on a single aspect of human nature, overpowers the orderly perception of the whole.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet the feelings too bring truths home to the minds of many who in the way of reason would be incapable of understanding them.</div><div class="sentence"> Reflections of this kind may have been passing before Plato's mind when he describes the poet as inspired, or when, as in the Apology, he speaks of poets as the worst critics of their own writings—anybody taken at random from the crowd is a better interpreter of them than they are of themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> They are sacred persons, 'winged and holy things' who have a touch of madness in their composition (Phaedr.</div><div class="sentence"> ), and should be treated with every sort of respect (Republic), but not allowed to live in a well-ordered state.</div><div class="sentence"> Like the Statesmen in the Meno, they have a divine instinct, but they are narrow and confused; they do not attain to the clearness of ideas, or to the knowledge of poetry or of any other art as a whole.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  In the Protagoras the ancient poets are recognized by Protagoras himself as the original sophists; and this family resemblance may be traced in the Ion.</div><div class="sentence"> The rhapsode belongs to the realm of imitation and of opinion: he professes to have all knowledge, which is derived by him from Homer, just as the sophist professes to have all wisdom, which is contained in his art of rhetoric.</div><div class="sentence"> Even more than the sophist he is incapable of appreciating the commonest logical distinctions; he cannot explain the nature of his own art; his great memory contrasts with his inability to follow the steps of the argument.</div><div class="sentence"> And in his highest moments of inspiration he has an eye to his own gains.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  The old quarrel between philosophy and poetry, which in the Republic leads to their final separation, is already working in the mind of Plato, and is embodied by him in the contrast between Socrates and Ion.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet here, as in the Republic, Socrates shows a sympathy with the poetic nature.</div><div class="sentence"> Also, the manner in which Ion is affected by his own recitations affords a lively illustration of the power which, in the Republic, Socrates attributes to dramatic performances over the mind of the performer.</div><div class="sentence"> His allusion to his embellishments of Homer, in which he declares himself to have surpassed Metrodorus of Lampsacus and Stesimbrotus of Thasos, seems to show that, like them, he belonged to the allegorical school of interpreters.</div><div class="sentence"> The circumstance that nothing more is known of him may be adduced in confirmation of the argument that this truly Platonic little work is not a forgery of later times.</div></div>

<div class="description">
<div class="book_description">PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:</div> Socrates, Ion. 
</div><div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Welcome, Ion.</div><div class="sentence"> Are you from your native city of Ephesus?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  No, Socrates; but from Epidaurus, where I attended the festival of Asclepius.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do the Epidaurians have contests of rhapsodes at the festival?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  O yes; and of all sorts of musical performers.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And were you one of the competitors—and did you succeed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  I obtained the first prize of all, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well done; and I hope that you will do the same for us at the Panathenaea.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  And I will, please heaven.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I often envy the profession of a rhapsode, Ion; for you have always to wear fine clothes, and to look as beautiful as you can is a part of your art.</div><div class="sentence"> Then, again, you are obliged to be continually in the company of many good poets; and especially of Homer, who is the best and most divine of them; and to understand him, and not merely learn his words by rote, is a thing greatly to be envied.</div><div class="sentence"> And no man can be a rhapsode who does not understand the meaning of the poet.</div><div class="sentence"> For the rhapsode ought to interpret the mind of the poet to his hearers, but how can he interpret him well unless he knows what he means?</div><div class="sentence"> All this is greatly to be envied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Very true, Socrates; interpretation has certainly been the most laborious part of my art; and I believe myself able to speak about Homer better than any man; and that neither Metrodorus of Lampsacus, nor Stesimbrotus of Thasos, nor Glaucon, nor any one else who ever was, had as good ideas about Homer as I have, or as many.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I am glad to hear you say so, Ion; I see that you will not refuse to acquaint me with them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly, Socrates; and you really ought to hear how exquisitely I render Homer.</div><div class="sentence"> I think that the Homeridae should give me a golden crown.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I shall take an opportunity of hearing your embellishments of him at some other time.</div><div class="sentence"> But just now I should like to ask you a question:  Does your art extend to Hesiod and Archilochus, or to Homer only?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  To Homer only; he is in himself quite enough.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Are there any things about which Homer and Hesiod agree?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; in my opinion there are a good many.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And can you interpret better what Homer says, or what Hesiod says, about these matters in which they agree?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  I can interpret them equally well, Socrates, where they agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But what about matters in which they do not agree?—for example, about divination, of which both Homer and Hesiod have something to say,—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Very true:</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Would you or a good prophet be a better interpreter of what these two poets say about divination, not only when they agree, but when they disagree?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  A prophet.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if you were a prophet, would you not be able to interpret them when they disagree as well as when they agree?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But how did you come to have this skill about Homer only, and not about Hesiod or the other poets?</div><div class="sentence"> Does not Homer speak of the same themes which all other poets handle?</div><div class="sentence"> Is not war his great argument?</div><div class="sentence"> and does he not speak of human society and of intercourse of men, good and bad, skilled and unskilled, and of the gods conversing with one another and with mankind, and about what happens in heaven and in the world below, and the generations of gods and heroes?</div><div class="sentence"> Are not these the themes of which Homer sings?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Very true, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do not the other poets sing of the same?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates; but not in the same way as Homer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What, in a worse way?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, in a far worse.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And Homer in a better way?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  He is incomparably better.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet surely, my dear friend Ion, in a discussion about arithmetic, where many people are speaking, and one speaks better than the rest, there is somebody who can judge which of them is the good speaker?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And he who judges of the good will be the same as he who judges of the bad speakers?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  The same.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And he will be the arithmetician?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, and in discussions about the wholesomeness of food, when many persons are speaking, and one speaks better than the rest, will he who recognizes the better speaker be a different person from him who recognizes the worse, or the same?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">040</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly the same.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And who is he, and what is his name?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  The physician.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">043</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And speaking generally, in all discussions in which the subject is the same and many men are speaking, will not he who knows the good know the bad speaker also?</div><div class="sentence"> For if he does not know the bad, neither will he know the good when the same topic is being discussed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">044</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Is not the same person skilful in both?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">046</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">047</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And you say that Homer and the other poets, such as Hesiod and Archilochus, speak of the same things, although not in the same way; but the one speaks well and the other not so well?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">048</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; and I am right in saying so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">049</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if you knew the good speaker, you would also know the inferior speakers to be inferior?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">050</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  That is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, my dear friend, can I be mistaken in saying that Ion is equally skilled in Homer and in other poets, since he himself acknowledges that the same person will be a good judge of all those who speak of the same things; and that almost all poets do speak of the same things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Why then, Socrates, do I lose attention and go to sleep and have absolutely no ideas of the least value, when any one speaks of any other poet; but when Homer is mentioned, I wake up at once and am all attention and have plenty to say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The reason, my friend, is obvious.</div><div class="sentence"> No one can fail to see that you speak of Homer without any art or knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> If you were able to speak of him by rules of art, you would have been able to speak of all other poets; for poetry is a whole.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And when any one acquires any other art as a whole, the same may be said of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Would you like me to explain my meaning, Ion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, indeed, Socrates; I very much wish that you would:  for I love to hear you wise men talk.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  O that we were wise, Ion, and that you could truly call us so; but you rhapsodes and actors, and the poets whose verses you sing, are wise; whereas I am a common man, who only speak the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> For consider what a very commonplace and trivial thing is this which I have said—a thing which any man might say:  that when a man has acquired a knowledge of a whole art, the enquiry into good and bad is one and the same.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us consider this matter; is not the art of painting a whole?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And there are and have been many painters good and bad?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And did you ever know any one who was skilful in pointing out the excellences and defects of Polygnotus the son of Aglaophon, but incapable of criticizing other painters; and when the work of any other painter was produced, went to sleep and was at a loss, and had no ideas; but when he had to give his opinion about Polygnotus, or whoever the painter might be, and about him only, woke up and was attentive and had plenty to say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  No indeed, I have never known such a person.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Or did you ever know of any one in sculpture, who was skilful in expounding the merits of Daedalus the son of Metion, or of Epeius the son of Panopeus, or of Theodorus the Samian, or of any individual sculptor; but when the works of sculptors in general were produced, was at a loss and went to sleep and had nothing to say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  No indeed; no more than the other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if I am not mistaken, you never met with any one among flute-players or harp-players or singers to the harp or rhapsodes who was able to discourse of Olympus or Thamyras or Orpheus, or Phemius the rhapsode of Ithaca, but was at a loss when he came to speak of Ion of Ephesus, and had no notion of his merits or defects?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  I cannot deny what you say, Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> Nevertheless I am conscious in my own self, and the world agrees with me in thinking that I do speak better and have more to say about Homer than any other man.</div><div class="sentence"> But I do not speak equally well about others—tell me the reason of this.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I perceive, Ion; and I will proceed to explain to you what I imagine to be the reason of this.</div><div class="sentence"> The gift which you possess of speaking excellently about Homer is not an art, but, as I was just saying, an inspiration; there is a divinity moving you, like that contained in the stone which Euripides calls a magnet, but which is commonly known as the stone of Heraclea.</div><div class="sentence"> This stone not only attracts iron rings, but also imparts to them a similar power of attracting other rings; and sometimes you may see a number of pieces of iron and rings suspended from one another so as to form quite a long chain:  and all of them derive their power of suspension from the original stone.</div><div class="sentence"> In like manner the Muse first of all inspires men herself; and from these inspired persons a chain of other persons is suspended, who take the inspiration.</div><div class="sentence"> For all good poets, epic as well as lyric, compose their beautiful poems not by art, but because they are inspired and possessed.</div><div class="sentence"> And as the Corybantian revellers when they dance are not in their right mind, so the lyric poets are not in their right mind when they are composing their beautiful strains:  but when falling under the power of music and metre they are inspired and possessed; like Bacchic maidens who draw milk and honey from the rivers when they are under the influence of Dionysus but not when they are in their right mind.</div><div class="sentence"> And the soul of the lyric poet does the same, as they themselves say; for they tell us that they bring songs from honeyed fountains, culling them out of the gardens and dells of the Muses; they, like the bees, winging their way from flower to flower.</div><div class="sentence"> And this is true.</div><div class="sentence"> For the poet is a light and winged and holy thing, and there is no invention in him until he has been inspired and is out of his senses, and the mind is no longer in him:  when he has not attained to this state, he is powerless and is unable to utter his oracles.</div><div class="sentence"> Many are the noble words in which poets speak concerning the actions of men; but like yourself when speaking about Homer, they do not speak of them by any rules of art:  they are simply inspired to utter that to which the Muse impels them, and that only; and when inspired, one of them will make dithyrambs, another hymns of praise, another choral strains, another epic or iambic verses—and he who is good at one is not good at any other kind of verse:  for not by art does the poet sing, but by power divine.</div><div class="sentence"> Had he learned by rules of art, he would have known how to speak not of one theme only, but of all; and therefore God takes away the minds of poets, and uses them as his ministers, as he also uses diviners and holy prophets, in order that we who hear them may know them to be speaking not of themselves who utter these priceless words in a state of unconsciousness, but that God himself is the speaker, and that through them he is conversing with us.</div><div class="sentence"> And Tynnichus the Chalcidian affords a striking instance of what I am saying:  he wrote nothing that any one would care to remember but the famous paean which is in every one's mouth, one of the finest poems ever written, simply an invention of the Muses, as he himself says.</div><div class="sentence"> For in this way the God would seem to indicate to us and not allow us to doubt that these beautiful poems are not human, or the work of man, but divine and the work of God; and that the poets are only the interpreters of the Gods by whom they are severally possessed.</div><div class="sentence"> Was not this the lesson which the God intended to teach when by the mouth of the worst of poets he sang the best of songs?</div><div class="sentence"> Am I not right, Ion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, indeed, Socrates, I feel that you are; for your words touch my soul, and I am persuaded that good poets by a divine inspiration interpret the things of the Gods to us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And you rhapsodists are the interpreters of the poets?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  There again you are right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then you are the interpreters of interpreters?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Precisely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I wish you would frankly tell me, Ion, what I am going to ask of you:  When you produce the greatest effect upon the audience in the recitation of some striking passage, such as the apparition of Odysseus leaping forth on the floor, recognized by the suitors and casting his arrows at his feet, or the description of Achilles rushing at Hector, or the sorrows of Andromache, Hecuba, or Priam,—are you in your right mind?</div><div class="sentence"> Are you not carried out of yourself, and does not your soul in an ecstasy seem to be among the persons or places of which you are speaking, whether they are in Ithaca or in Troy or whatever may be the scene of the poem?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">074</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  That proof strikes home to me, Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> For I must frankly confess that at the tale of pity my eyes are filled with tears, and when I speak of horrors, my hair stands on end and my heart throbs.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, Ion, and what are we to say of a man who at a sacrifice or festival, when he is dressed in holiday attire, and has golden crowns upon his head, of which nobody has robbed him, appears weeping or panic-stricken in the presence of more than twenty thousand friendly faces, when there is no one despoiling or wronging him;—is he in his right mind or is he not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">076</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  No indeed, Socrates, I must say that, strictly speaking, he is not in his right mind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And are you aware that you produce similar effects on most of the spectators?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">078</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Only too well; for I look down upon them from the stage, and behold the various emotions of pity, wonder, sternness, stamped upon their countenances when I am speaking:  and I am obliged to give my very best attention to them; for if I make them cry I myself shall laugh, and if I make them laugh I myself shall cry when the time of payment arrives.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">079</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do you know that the spectator is the last of the rings which, as I am saying, receive the power of the original magnet from one another?</div><div class="sentence"> The rhapsode like yourself and the actor are intermediate links, and the poet himself is the first of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Through all these the God sways the souls of men in any direction which he pleases, and makes one man hang down from another.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus there is a vast chain of dancers and masters and under-masters of choruses, who are suspended, as if from the stone, at the side of the rings which hang down from the Muse.</div><div class="sentence"> And every poet has some Muse from whom he is suspended, and by whom he is said to be possessed, which is nearly the same thing; for he is taken hold of.</div><div class="sentence"> And from these first rings, which are the poets, depend others, some deriving their inspiration from Orpheus, others from Musaeus; but the greater number are possessed and held by Homer.</div><div class="sentence"> Of whom, Ion, you are one, and are possessed by Homer; and when any one repeats the words of another poet you go to sleep, and know not what to say; but when any one recites a strain of Homer you wake up in a moment, and your soul leaps within you, and you have plenty to say; for not by art or knowledge about Homer do you say what you say, but by divine inspiration and by possession; just as the Corybantian revellers too have a quick perception of that strain only which is appropriated to the God by whom they are possessed, and have plenty of dances and words for that, but take no heed of any other.</div><div class="sentence"> And you, Ion, when the name of Homer is mentioned have plenty to say, and have nothing to say of others.</div><div class="sentence"> You ask, 'Why is this?'</div><div class="sentence"> The answer is that you praise Homer not by art but by divine inspiration.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  That is good, Socrates; and yet I doubt whether you will ever have eloquence enough to persuade me that I praise Homer only when I am mad and possessed; and if you could hear me speak of him I am sure you would never think this to be the case.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">081</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I should like very much to hear you, but not until you have answered a question which I have to ask.</div><div class="sentence"> On what part of Homer do you speak well?—not surely about every part.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">084</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  And what is there in Homer of which I have no knowledge?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">085</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, does not Homer speak in many passages about arts?</div><div class="sentence"> For example, about driving; if I can only remember the lines I will repeat them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">086</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  I remember, and will repeat them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Tell me then, what Nestor says to Antilochus, his son, where he bids him be careful of the turn at the horserace in honour of Patroclus.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, surely; for if the subject of knowledge were the same, there would be no meaning in saying that the arts were different,—if they both gave the same knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> For example, I know that here are five fingers, and you know the same.</div><div class="sentence"> And if I were to ask whether I and you became acquainted with this fact by the help of the same art of arithmetic, you would acknowledge that we did?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">171</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And are you the best general, Ion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">172</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure, Socrates; and Homer was my master.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">173</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But then, Ion, what in the name of goodness can be the reason why you, who are the best of generals as well as the best of rhapsodes in all Hellas, go about as a rhapsode when you might be a general?</div><div class="sentence"> Do you think that the Hellenes want a rhapsode with his golden crown, and do not want a general?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">174</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Why, Socrates, the reason is, that my countrymen, the Ephesians, are the servants and soldiers of Athens, and do not need a general; and you and Sparta are not likely to have me, for you think that you have enough generals of your own.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">175</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  My good Ion, did you never hear of Apollodorus of Cyzicus?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">176</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  Who may he be?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">177</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  One who, though a foreigner, has often been chosen their general by the Athenians:  and there is Phanosthenes of Andros, and Heraclides of Clazomenae, whom they have also appointed to the command of their armies and to other offices, although aliens, after they had shown their merit.</div><div class="sentence"> And will they not choose Ion the Ephesian to be their general, and honour him, if he prove himself worthy?</div><div class="sentence"> Were not the Ephesians originally Athenians, and Ephesus is no mean city?</div><div class="sentence"> But, indeed, Ion, if you are correct in saying that by art and knowledge you are able to praise Homer, you do not deal fairly with me, and after all your professions of knowing many glorious things about Homer, and promises that you would exhibit them, you are only a deceiver, and so far from exhibiting the art of which you are a master, will not, even after my repeated entreaties, explain to me the nature of it.</div><div class="sentence"> You have literally as many forms as Proteus; and now you go all manner of ways, twisting and turning, and, like Proteus, become all manner of people at once, and at last slip away from me in the disguise of a general, in order that you may escape exhibiting your Homeric lore.</div><div class="sentence"> And if you have art, then, as I was saying, in falsifying your promise that you would exhibit Homer, you are not dealing fairly with me.</div><div class="sentence"> But if, as I believe, you have no art, but speak all these beautiful words about Homer unconsciously under his inspiring influence, then I acquit you of dishonesty, and shall only say that you are inspired.</div><div class="sentence"> Which do you prefer to be thought, dishonest or inspired?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">178</span><div class="speaker">ION</div><div class="sentence">  There is a great difference, Socrates, between the two alternatives; and inspiration is by far the nobler.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">179</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, Ion, I shall assume the nobler alternative; and attribute to you in your praises of Homer inspiration, and not art.</div></div>
