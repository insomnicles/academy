<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  No answer is given in the Lysis to the question, 'What is Friendship?'</div><div class="sentence"> any more than in the Charmides to the question, 'What is Temperance?'</div><div class="sentence"> There are several resemblances in the two Dialogues: the same youthfulness and sense of beauty pervades both of them; they are alike rich in the description of Greek life.</div><div class="sentence"> The question is again raised of the relation of knowledge to virtue and good, which also recurs in the Laches; and Socrates appears again as the elder friend of the two boys, Lysis and Menexenus.</div><div class="sentence"> In the Charmides, as also in the Laches, he is described as middle-aged; in the Lysis he is advanced in years.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  The Dialogue consists of two scenes or conversations which seem to have no relation to each other.</div><div class="sentence"> The first is a conversation between Socrates and Lysis, who, like Charmides, is an Athenian youth of noble descent and of great beauty, goodness, and intelligence: this is carried on in the absence of Menexenus, who is called away to take part in a sacrifice.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates asks Lysis whether his father and mother do not love him very much?</div><div class="sentence"> 'To be sure they do.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Then of course they allow him to do exactly as he likes.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Of course not: the very slaves have more liberty than he has.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'But how is this?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'The reason is that he is not old enough.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'No; the real reason is that he is not wise enough: for are there not some things which he is allowed to do, although he is not allowed to do others?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Yes, because he knows them, and does not know the others.'</div><div class="sentence"> This leads to the conclusion that all men everywhere will trust him in what he knows, but not in what he does not know; for in such matters he will be unprofitable to them, and do them no good.</div><div class="sentence"> And no one will love him, if he does them no good; and he can only do them good by knowledge; and as he is still without knowledge, he can have as yet no conceit of knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> In this manner Socrates reads a lesson to Hippothales, the foolish lover of Lysis, respecting the style of conversation which he should address to his beloved.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  After the return of Menexenus, Socrates, at the request of Lysis, asks him a new question: 'What is friendship?</div><div class="sentence"> You, Menexenus, who have a friend already, can tell me, who am always longing to find one, what is the secret of this great blessing.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  When one man loves another, which is the friend—he who loves, or he who is loved?</div><div class="sentence"> Or are both friends?</div><div class="sentence"> From the first of these suppositions they are driven to the second; and from the second to the third; and neither the two boys nor Socrates are satisfied with any of the three or with all of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates turns to the poets, who affirm that God brings like to like (Homer), and to philosophers (Empedocles), who also assert that like is the friend of like.</div><div class="sentence"> But the bad are not friends, for they are not even like themselves, and still less are they like one another.</div><div class="sentence"> And the good have no need of one another, and therefore do not care about one another.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover there are others who say that likeness is a cause of aversion, and unlikeness of love and friendship; and they too adduce the authority of poets and philosophers in support of their doctrines; for Hesiod says that 'potter is jealous of potter, bard of bard;' and subtle doctors tell us that 'moist is the friend of dry, hot of cold,' and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> But neither can their doctrine be maintained; for then the just would be the friend of the unjust, good of evil.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  Thus we arrive at the conclusion that like is not the friend of like, nor unlike of unlike; and therefore good is not the friend of good, nor evil of evil, nor good of evil, nor evil of good.</div><div class="sentence"> What remains but that the indifferent, which is neither good nor evil, should be the friend (not of the indifferent, for that would be 'like the friend of like,' but) of the good, or rather of the beautiful?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  But why should the indifferent have this attachment to the beautiful or good?</div><div class="sentence"> There are circumstances under which such an attachment would be natural.</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose the indifferent, say the human body, to be desirous of getting rid of some evil, such as disease, which is not essential but only accidental to it (for if the evil were essential the body would cease to be indifferent, and would become evil)—in such a case the indifferent becomes a friend of the good for the sake of getting rid of the evil.</div><div class="sentence"> In this intermediate 'indifferent' position the philosopher or lover of wisdom stands: he is not wise, and yet not unwise, but he has ignorance accidentally clinging to him, and he yearns for wisdom as the cure of the evil.</div><div class="sentence"> (Symp.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  After this explanation has been received with triumphant accord, a fresh dissatisfaction begins to steal over the mind of Socrates: Must not friendship be for the sake of some ulterior end?</div><div class="sentence"> and what can that final cause or end of friendship be, other than the good?</div><div class="sentence"> But the good is desired by us only as the cure of evil; and therefore if there were no evil there would be no friendship.</div><div class="sentence"> Some other explanation then has to be devised.</div><div class="sentence"> May not desire be the source of friendship?</div><div class="sentence"> And desire is of what a man wants and of what is congenial to him.</div><div class="sentence"> But then the congenial cannot be the same as the like; for like, as has been already shown, cannot be the friend of like.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor can the congenial be the good; for good is not the friend of good, as has been also shown.</div><div class="sentence"> The problem is unsolved, and the three friends, Socrates, Lysis, and Menexenus, are still unable to find out what a friend is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  Thus, as in the Charmides and Laches, and several of the other Dialogues of Plato (compare especially the Protagoras and Theaetetus), no conclusion is arrived at.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates maintains his character of a 'know nothing;' but the boys have already learned the lesson which he is unable to teach them, and they are free from the conceit of knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Chrm.)</div><div class="sentence"> The dialogue is what would be called in the language of Thrasyllus tentative or inquisitive.</div><div class="sentence"> The subject is continued in the Phaedrus and Symposium, and treated, with a manifest reference to the Lysis, in the eighth and ninth books of the Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle.</div><div class="sentence"> As in other writings of Plato (for example, the Republic), there is a progress from unconscious morality, illustrated by the friendship of the two youths, and also by the sayings of the poets ('who are our fathers in wisdom,' and yet only tell us half the truth, and in this particular instance are not much improved upon by the philosophers), to a more comprehensive notion of friendship.</div><div class="sentence"> This, however, is far from being cleared of its perplexity.</div><div class="sentence"> Two notions appear to be struggling or balancing in the mind of Socrates:—First, the sense that friendship arises out of human needs and wants; Secondly, that the higher form or ideal of friendship exists only for the sake of the good.</div><div class="sentence"> That friends are not necessarily either like or unlike, is also a truth confirmed by experience.</div><div class="sentence"> But the use of the terms 'like' or 'good' is too strictly limited; Socrates has allowed himself to be carried away by a sort of eristic or illogical logic against which no definition of friendship would be able to stand.</div><div class="sentence"> In the course of the argument he makes a distinction between property and accident which is a real contribution to the science of logic.</div><div class="sentence"> Some higher truths appear through the mist.</div><div class="sentence"> The manner in which the field of argument is widened, as in the Charmides and Laches by the introduction of the idea of knowledge, so here by the introduction of the good, is deserving of attention.</div><div class="sentence"> The sense of the inter-dependence of good and evil, and the allusion to the possibility of the non-existence of evil, are also very remarkable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span> <div class="sentence">  The dialectical interest is fully sustained by the dramatic accompaniments.</div><div class="sentence"> Observe, first, the scene, which is a Greek Palaestra, at a time when a sacrifice is going on, and the Hermaea are in course of celebration; secondly, the 'accustomed irony' of Socrates, who declares, as in the Symposium, that he is ignorant of all other things, but claims to have a knowledge of the mysteries of love.</div><div class="sentence"> There are likewise several contrasts of character; first of the dry, caustic Ctesippus, of whom Socrates professes a humorous sort of fear, and Hippothales the flighty lover, who murders sleep by bawling out the name of his beloved; there is also a contrast between the false, exaggerated, sentimental love of Hippothales towards Lysis, and the childlike and innocent friendship of the boys with one another.</div><div class="sentence"> Some difference appears to be intended between the characters of the more talkative Menexenus and the reserved and simple Lysis.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates draws out the latter by a new sort of irony, which is sometimes adopted in talking to children, and consists in asking a leading question which can only be answered in a sense contrary to the intention of the question: 'Your father and mother of course allow you to drive the chariot?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'No they do not.'</div><div class="sentence"> When Menexenus returns, the serious dialectic begins.</div><div class="sentence"> He is described as 'very pugnacious,' and we are thus prepared for the part which a mere youth takes in a difficult argument.</div><div class="sentence"> But Plato has not forgotten dramatic propriety, and Socrates proposes at last to refer the question to some older person.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span> <div class="sentence">  SOME QUESTIONS RELATING TO FRIENDSHIP.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span> <div class="sentence">  The subject of friendship has a lower place in the modern than in the ancient world, partly because a higher place is assigned by us to love and marriage.</div><div class="sentence"> The very meaning of the word has become slighter and more superficial; it seems almost to be borrowed from the ancients, and has nearly disappeared in modern treatises on Moral Philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> The received examples of friendship are to be found chiefly among the Greeks and Romans.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence the casuistical or other questions which arise out of the relations of friends have not often been considered seriously in modern times.</div><div class="sentence"> Many of them will be found to be the same which are discussed in the Lysis.</div><div class="sentence"> We may ask with Socrates, 1) whether friendship is 'of similars or dissimilars,' or of both; 2) whether such a tie exists between the good only and for the sake of the good; or 3) whether there may not be some peculiar attraction, which draws together 'the neither good nor evil' for the sake of the good and because of the evil; 4) whether friendship is always mutual,—may there not be a one-sided and unrequited friendship?</div><div class="sentence"> This question, which, like many others, is only one of a laxer or stricter use of words, seems to have greatly exercised the minds both of Aristotle and Plato.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span> <div class="sentence">  5) Can we expect friendship to be permanent, or must we acknowledge with Cicero, 'Nihil difficilius quam amicitiam usque ad extremum vitae permanere'?</div><div class="sentence"> Is not friendship, even more than love, liable to be swayed by the caprices of fancy?</div><div class="sentence"> The person who pleased us most at first sight or upon a slight acquaintance, when we have seen him again, and under different circumstances, may make a much less favourable impression on our minds.</div><div class="sentence"> Young people swear 'eternal friendships,' but at these innocent perjuries their elders laugh.</div><div class="sentence"> No one forms a friendship with the intention of renouncing it; yet in the course of a varied life it is practically certain that many changes will occur of feeling, opinion, locality, occupation, fortune, which will divide us from some persons and unite us to others.</div><div class="sentence"> 6) There is an ancient saying, Qui amicos amicum non habet.</div><div class="sentence"> But is not some less exclusive form of friendship better suited to the condition and nature of man?</div><div class="sentence"> And in those especially who have no family ties, may not the feeling pass beyond one or a few, and embrace all with whom we come into contact, and, perhaps in a few passionate and exalted natures, all men everywhere?</div><div class="sentence"> 7) The ancients had their three kinds of friendship, 'for the sake of the pleasant, the useful, and the good:' is the last to be resolved into the two first; or are the two first to be included in the last?</div><div class="sentence"> The subject was puzzling to them: they could not say that friendship was only a quality, or a relation, or a virtue, or a kind of virtue; and they had not in the age of Plato reached the point of regarding it, like justice, as a form or attribute of virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> They had another perplexity: 8) How could one of the noblest feelings of human nature be so near to one of the most detestable corruptions of it?</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Symposium; Laws).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span> <div class="sentence">  Leaving the Greek or ancient point of view, we may regard the question in a more general way.</div><div class="sentence"> Friendship is the union of two persons in mutual affection and remembrance of one another.</div><div class="sentence"> The friend can do for his friend what he cannot do for himself.</div><div class="sentence"> He can give him counsel in time of difficulty; he can teach him 'to see himself as others see him'; he can stand by him, when all the world are against him; he can gladden and enlighten him by his presence; he 'can divide his sorrows,' he can 'double his joys;' he can anticipate his wants.</div><div class="sentence"> He will discover ways of helping him without creating a sense of his own superiority; he will find out his mental trials, but only that he may minister to them.</div><div class="sentence"> Among true friends jealousy has no place: they do not complain of one another for making new friends, or for not revealing some secret of their lives; (in friendship too there must be reserves;) they do not intrude upon one another, and they mutually rejoice in any good which happens to either of them, though it may be to the loss of the other.</div><div class="sentence"> They may live apart and have little intercourse, but when they meet, the old tie is as strong as ever—according to the common saying, they find one another always the same.</div><div class="sentence"> The greatest good of friendship is not daily intercourse, for circumstances rarely admit of this; but on the great occasions of life, when the advice of a friend is needed, then the word spoken in season about conduct, about health, about marriage, about business,—the letter written from a distance by a disinterested person who sees with clearer eyes may be of inestimable value.</div><div class="sentence"> When the heart is failing and despair is setting in, then to hear the voice or grasp the hand of a friend, in a shipwreck, in a defeat, in some other failure or misfortune, may restore the necessary courage and composure to the paralysed and disordered mind, and convert the feeble person into a hero; (compare Symposium).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span> <div class="sentence">  It is true that friendships are apt to be disappointing: either we expect too much from them; or we are indolent and do not 'keep them in repair;' or being admitted to intimacy with another, we see his faults too clearly and lose our respect for him; and he loses his affection for us.</div><div class="sentence"> Friendships may be too violent; and they may be too sensitive.</div><div class="sentence"> The egotism of one of the parties may be too much for the other.</div><div class="sentence"> The word of counsel or sympathy has been uttered too obtrusively, at the wrong time, or in the wrong manner; or the need of it has not been perceived until too late.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Oh if he had only told me' has been the silent thought of many a troubled soul.</div><div class="sentence"> And some things have to be indicated rather than spoken, because the very mention of them tends to disturb the equability of friendship.</div><div class="sentence"> The alienation of friends, like many other human evils, is commonly due to a want of tact and insight.</div><div class="sentence"> There is not enough of the Scimus et hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim.</div><div class="sentence"> The sweet draught of sympathy is not inexhaustible; and it tends to weaken the person who too freely partakes of it.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus we see that there are many causes which impair the happiness of friends.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span> <div class="sentence">  We may expect a friendship almost divine, such as philosophers have sometimes dreamed of: we find what is human.</div><div class="sentence"> The good of it is necessarily limited; it does not take the place of marriage; it affords rather a solace than an arm of support.</div><div class="sentence"> It had better not be based on pecuniary obligations; these more often mar than make a friendship.</div><div class="sentence"> It is most likely to be permanent when the two friends are equal and independent, or when they are engaged together in some common work or have some public interest in common.</div><div class="sentence"> It exists among the bad or inferior sort of men almost as much as among the good; the bad and good, and 'the neither bad nor good,' are drawn together in a strange manner by personal attachment.</div><div class="sentence"> The essence of it is loyalty, without which it would cease to be friendship.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span> <div class="sentence">  Another question 9) may be raised, whether friendship can safely exist between young persons of different sexes, not connected by ties of relationship, and without the thought of love or marriage; whether, again, a wife or a husband should have any intimate friend, besides his or her partner in marriage.</div><div class="sentence"> The answer to this latter question is rather perplexing, and would probably be different in different countries (compare Sympos.).</div><div class="sentence"> While we do not deny that great good may result from such attachments, for the mind may be drawn out and the character enlarged by them; yet we feel also that they are attended with many dangers, and that this Romance of Heavenly Love requires a strength, a freedom from passion, a self-control, which, in youth especially, are rarely to be found.</div><div class="sentence"> The propriety of such friendships must be estimated a good deal by the manner in which public opinion regards them; they must be reconciled with the ordinary duties of life; and they must be justified by the result.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span> <div class="sentence">  Yet another question, 10).</div><div class="sentence"> Admitting that friendships cannot be always permanent, we may ask when and upon what conditions should they be dissolved.</div><div class="sentence"> It would be futile to retain the name when the reality has ceased to be.</div><div class="sentence"> That two friends should part company whenever the relation between them begins to drag may be better for both of them.</div><div class="sentence"> But then arises the consideration, how should these friends in youth or friends of the past regard or be regarded by one another?</div><div class="sentence"> They are parted, but there still remain duties mutually owing by them.</div><div class="sentence"> They will not admit the world to share in their difference any more than in their friendship; the memory of an old attachment, like the memory of the dead, has a kind of sacredness for them on which they will not allow others to intrude.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither, if they were ever worthy to bear the name of friends, will either of them entertain any enmity or dislike of the other who was once so much to him.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither will he by 'shadowed hint reveal' the secrets great or small which an unfortunate mistake has placed within his reach.</div><div class="sentence"> He who is of a noble mind will dwell upon his own faults rather than those of another, and will be ready to take upon himself the blame of their separation.</div><div class="sentence"> He will feel pain at the loss of a friend; and he will remember with gratitude his ancient kindness.</div><div class="sentence"> But he will not lightly renew a tie which has not been lightly broken...These are a few of the Problems of Friendship, some of them suggested by the Lysis, others by modern life, which he who wishes to make or keep a friend may profitably study.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Bacon, Essay on Friendship; Cic.</div><div class="sentence"> de Amicitia.)</div></div>

<h2>PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE</h2>


<div class="description">
<div class="book_description">SCENE:</div> A newly-erected Palaestra outside the walls of Athens. 
</div><div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  I was going from the Academy straight to the Lyceum, intending to take the outer road, which is close under the wall.</div><div class="sentence"> When I came to the postern gate of the city, which is by the fountain of Panops, I fell in with Hippothales, the son of Hieronymus, and Ctesippus the Paeanian, and a company of young men who were standing with them.</div><div class="sentence"> Hippothales, seeing me approach, asked whence I came and whither I was going.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  I am going, I replied, from the Academy straight to the Lyceum.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Then come straight to us, he said, and put in here; you may as well.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  Who are you, I said; and where am I to come?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  He showed me an enclosed space and an open door over against the wall.</div><div class="sentence"> And there, he said, is the building at which we all meet: and a goodly company we are.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  And what is this building, I asked; and what sort of entertainment have you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  The building, he replied, is a newly erected Palaestra; and the entertainment is generally conversation, to which you are welcome.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  Thank you, I said; and is there any teacher there?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, he said, your old friend and admirer, Miccus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span> <div class="sentence">  Indeed, I replied; he is a very eminent professor.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span> <div class="sentence">  Are you disposed, he said, to go with me and see them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, I said; but I should like to know first, what is expected of me, and who is the favourite among you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span> <div class="sentence">  Some persons have one favourite, Socrates, and some another, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span> <div class="sentence">  And who is yours?</div><div class="sentence"> I asked: tell me that, Hippothales.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span> <div class="sentence">  At this he blushed; and I said to him, O Hippothales, thou son of Hieronymus!</div><div class="sentence"> do not say that you are, or that you are not, in love; the confession is too late; for I see that you are not only in love, but are already far gone in your love.</div><div class="sentence"> Simple and foolish as I am, the Gods have given me the power of understanding affections of this kind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span> <div class="sentence">  Whereupon he blushed more and more.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span> <div class="sentence">  Ctesippus said: I like to see you blushing, Hippothales, and hesitating to tell Socrates the name; when, if he were with you but for a very short time, you would have plagued him to death by talking about nothing else.</div><div class="sentence"> Indeed, Socrates, he has literally deafened us, and stopped our ears with the praises of Lysis; and if he is a little intoxicated, there is every likelihood that we may have our sleep murdered with a cry of Lysis.</div><div class="sentence"> His performances in prose are bad enough, but nothing at all in comparison with his verse; and when he drenches us with his poems and other compositions, it is really too bad; and worse still is his manner of singing them to his love; he has a voice which is truly appalling, and we cannot help hearing him: and now having a question put to him by you, behold he is blushing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span> <div class="sentence">  Who is Lysis?</div><div class="sentence"> I said: I suppose that he must be young; for the name does not recall any one to me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span> <div class="sentence">  Why, he said, his father being a very well-known man, he retains his patronymic, and is not as yet commonly called by his own name; but, although you do not know his name, I am sure that you must know his face, for that is quite enough to distinguish him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span> <div class="sentence">  But tell me whose son he is, I said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span> <div class="sentence">  He is the eldest son of Democrates, of the deme of Aexone.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span> <div class="sentence">  Ah, Hippothales, I said; what a noble and really perfect love you have found!</div><div class="sentence"> I wish that you would favour me with the exhibition which you have been making to the rest of the company, and then I shall be able to judge whether you know what a lover ought to say about his love, either to the youth himself, or to others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span> <div class="sentence">  Nay, Socrates, he said; you surely do not attach any importance to what he is saying.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span> <div class="sentence">  Do you mean, I said, that you disown the love of the person whom he says that you love?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span> <div class="sentence">  No; but I deny that I make verses or address compositions to him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span> <div class="sentence">  He is not in his right mind, said Ctesippus; he is talking nonsense, and is stark mad.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span> <div class="sentence">  O Hippothales, I said, if you have ever made any verses or songs in honour of your favourite, I do not want to hear them; but I want to know the purport of them, that I may be able to judge of your mode of approaching your fair one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span> <div class="sentence">  Ctesippus will be able to tell you, he said; for if, as he avers, the sound of my words is always dinning in his ears, he must have a very accurate knowledge and recollection of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, indeed, said Ctesippus; I know only too well; and very ridiculous the tale is: for although he is a lover, and very devotedly in love, he has nothing particular to talk about to his beloved which a child might not say.</div><div class="sentence"> Now is not that ridiculous?</div><div class="sentence"> He can only speak of the wealth of Democrates, which the whole city celebrates, and grandfather Lysis, and the other ancestors of the youth, and their stud of horses, and their victory at the Pythian games, and at the Isthmus, and at Nemea with four horses and single horses—these are the tales which he composes and repeats.</div><div class="sentence"> And there is greater twaddle still.</div><div class="sentence"> Only the day before yesterday he made a poem in which he described the entertainment of Heracles, who was a connexion of the family, setting forth how in virtue of this relationship he was hospitably received by an ancestor of Lysis; this ancestor was himself begotten of Zeus by the daughter of the founder of the deme.</div><div class="sentence"> And these are the sort of old wives' tales which he sings and recites to us, and we are obliged to listen to him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span> <div class="sentence">  When I heard this, I said: O ridiculous Hippothales!</div><div class="sentence"> how can you be making and singing hymns in honour of yourself before you have won?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span> <div class="sentence">  But my songs and verses, he said, are not in honour of myself, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span> <div class="sentence">  You think not?</div><div class="sentence"> I said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span> <div class="sentence">  Nay, but what do you think?</div><div class="sentence"> he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span> <div class="sentence">  Most assuredly, I said, those songs are all in your own honour; for if you win your beautiful love, your discourses and songs will be a glory to you, and may be truly regarded as hymns of praise composed in honour of you who have conquered and won such a love; but if he slips away from you, the more you have praised him, the more ridiculous you will look at having lost this fairest and best of blessings; and therefore the wise lover does not praise his beloved until he has won him, because he is afraid of accidents.</div><div class="sentence"> There is also another danger; the fair, when any one praises or magnifies them, are filled with the spirit of pride and vain-glory.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you not agree with me?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span> <div class="sentence">  And the more vain-glorious they are, the more difficult is the capture of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span> <div class="sentence">  I believe you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span> <div class="sentence">  What should you say of a hunter who frightened away his prey, and made the capture of the animals which he is hunting more difficult?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span> <div class="sentence">  He would be a bad hunter, undoubtedly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">040</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes; and if, instead of soothing them, he were to infuriate them with words and songs, that would show a great want of wit: do you not agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span> <div class="sentence">  And now reflect, Hippothales, and see whether you are not guilty of all these errors in writing poetry.</div><div class="sentence"> For I can hardly suppose that you will affirm a man to be a good poet who injures himself by his poetry.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">043</span> <div class="sentence">  Assuredly not, he said; such a poet would be a fool.</div><div class="sentence"> And this is the reason why I take you into my counsels, Socrates, and I shall be glad of any further advice which you may have to offer.</div><div class="sentence"> Will you tell me by what words or actions I may become endeared to my love?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">044</span> <div class="sentence">  That is not easy to determine, I said; but if you will bring your love to me, and will let me talk with him, I may perhaps be able to show you how to converse with him, instead of singing and reciting in the fashion of which you are accused.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span> <div class="sentence">  There will be no difficulty in bringing him, he replied; if you will only go with Ctesippus into the Palaestra, and sit down and talk, I believe that he will come of his own accord; for he is fond of listening, Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> And as this is the festival of the Hermaea, the young men and boys are all together, and there is no separation between them.</div><div class="sentence"> He will be sure to come: but if he does not, Ctesippus with whom he is familiar, and whose relation Menexenus is his great friend, shall call him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">046</span> <div class="sentence">  That will be the way, I said.</div><div class="sentence"> Thereupon I led Ctesippus into the Palaestra, and the rest followed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">047</span> <div class="sentence">  Upon entering we found that the boys had just been sacrificing; and this part of the festival was nearly at an end.</div><div class="sentence"> They were all in their white array, and games at dice were going on among them.</div><div class="sentence"> Most of them were in the outer court amusing themselves; but some were in a corner of the Apodyterium playing at odd and even with a number of dice, which they took out of little wicker baskets.</div><div class="sentence"> There was also a circle of lookers-on; among them was Lysis.</div><div class="sentence"> He was standing with the other boys and youths, having a crown upon his head, like a fair vision, and not less worthy of praise for his goodness than for his beauty.</div><div class="sentence"> We left them, and went over to the opposite side of the room, where, finding a quiet place, we sat down; and then we began to talk.</div><div class="sentence"> This attracted Lysis, who was constantly turning round to look at us—he was evidently wanting to come to us.</div><div class="sentence"> For a time he hesitated and had not the courage to come alone; but first of all, his friend Menexenus, leaving his play, entered the Palaestra from the court, and when he saw Ctesippus and myself, was going to take a seat by us; and then Lysis, seeing him, followed, and sat down by his side; and the other boys joined.</div><div class="sentence"> I should observe that Hippothales, when he saw the crowd, got behind them, where he thought that he would be out of sight of Lysis, lest he should anger him; and there he stood and listened.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">048</span> <div class="sentence">  I turned to Menexenus, and said: Son of Demophon, which of you two youths is the elder?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">049</span> <div class="sentence">  That is a matter of dispute between us, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">050</span> <div class="sentence">  And which is the nobler?</div><div class="sentence"> Is that also a matter of dispute?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span> <div class="sentence">  And another disputed point is, which is the fairer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span> <div class="sentence">  The two boys laughed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span> <div class="sentence">  I shall not ask which is the richer of the two, I said; for you are friends, are you not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly, they replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span> <div class="sentence">  And friends have all things in common, so that one of you can be no richer than the other, if you say truly that you are friends.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span> <div class="sentence">  They assented.</div><div class="sentence"> I was about to ask which was the juster of the two, and which was the wiser of the two; but at this moment Menexenus was called away by some one who came and said that the gymnastic-master wanted him.</div><div class="sentence"> I supposed that he had to offer sacrifice.</div><div class="sentence"> So he went away, and I asked Lysis some more questions.</div><div class="sentence"> I dare say, Lysis, I said, that your father and mother love you very much.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span> <div class="sentence">  And they would wish you to be perfectly happy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span> <div class="sentence">  But do you think that any one is happy who is in the condition of a slave, and who cannot do what he likes?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span> <div class="sentence">  I should think not indeed, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span> <div class="sentence">  And if your father and mother love you, and desire that you should be happy, no one can doubt that they are very ready to promote your happiness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span> <div class="sentence">  And do they then permit you to do what you like, and never rebuke you or hinder you from doing what you desire?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, indeed, Socrates; there are a great many things which they hinder me from doing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span> <div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div><div class="sentence"> I said.</div><div class="sentence"> Do they want you to be happy, and yet hinder you from doing what you like?</div><div class="sentence"> for example, if you want to mount one of your father's chariots, and take the reins at a race, they will not allow you to do so—they will prevent you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly, he said, they will not allow me to do so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span> <div class="sentence">  Whom then will they allow?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span> <div class="sentence">  There is a charioteer, whom my father pays for driving.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span> <div class="sentence">  And do they trust a hireling more than you?</div><div class="sentence"> and may he do what he likes with the horses?</div><div class="sentence"> and do they pay him for this?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span> <div class="sentence">  They do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span> <div class="sentence">  But I dare say that you may take the whip and guide the mule-cart if you like;—they will permit that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">074</span> <div class="sentence">  Permit me!</div><div class="sentence"> indeed they will not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, I said, may no one use the whip to the mules?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">076</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, he said, the muleteer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span> <div class="sentence">  And is he a slave or a free man?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">078</span> <div class="sentence">  A slave, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">079</span> <div class="sentence">  And do they esteem a slave of more value than you who are their son?</div><div class="sentence"> And do they entrust their property to him rather than to you?</div><div class="sentence"> and allow him to do what he likes, when they prohibit you?</div><div class="sentence"> Answer me now: Are you your own master, or do they not even allow that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span> <div class="sentence">  Nay, he said; of course they do not allow it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">081</span> <div class="sentence">  Then you have a master?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">082</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, my tutor; there he is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">083</span> <div class="sentence">  And is he a slave?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">084</span> <div class="sentence">  To be sure; he is our slave, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">085</span> <div class="sentence">  Surely, I said, this is a strange thing, that a free man should be governed by a slave.</div><div class="sentence"> And what does he do with you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">086</span> <div class="sentence">  He takes me to my teachers.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span> <div class="sentence">  You do not mean to say that your teachers also rule over you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">088</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course they do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span> <div class="sentence">  Then I must say that your father is pleased to inflict many lords and masters on you.</div><div class="sentence"> But at any rate when you go home to your mother, she will let you have your own way, and will not interfere with your happiness; her wool, or the piece of cloth which she is weaving, are at your disposal: I am sure that there is nothing to hinder you from touching her wooden spathe, or her comb, or any other of her spinning implements.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span> <div class="sentence">  Nay, Socrates, he replied, laughing; not only does she hinder me, but I should be beaten if I were to touch one of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, I said, this is amazing.</div><div class="sentence"> And did you ever behave ill to your father or your mother?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span> <div class="sentence">  No, indeed, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">093</span> <div class="sentence">  But why then are they so terribly anxious to prevent you from being happy, and doing as you like?—keeping you all day long in subjection to another, and, in a word, doing nothing which you desire; so that you have no good, as would appear, out of their great possessions, which are under the control of anybody rather than of you, and have no use of your own fair person, which is tended and taken care of by another; while you, Lysis, are master of nobody, and can do nothing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span> <div class="sentence">  Why, he said, Socrates, the reason is that I am not of age.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span> <div class="sentence">  I doubt whether that is the real reason, I said; for I should imagine that your father Democrates, and your mother, do permit you to do many things already, and do not wait until you are of age: for example, if they want anything read or written, you, I presume, would be the first person in the house who is summoned by them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span> <div class="sentence">  And you would be allowed to write or read the letters in any order which you please, or to take up the lyre and tune the notes, and play with the fingers, or strike with the plectrum, exactly as you please, and neither father nor mother would interfere with you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">098</span> <div class="sentence">  That is true, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span> <div class="sentence">  Then what can be the reason, Lysis, I said, why they allow you to do the one and not the other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">100</span> <div class="sentence">  I suppose, he said, because I understand the one, and not the other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, my dear youth, I said, the reason is not any deficiency of years, but a deficiency of knowledge; and whenever your father thinks that you are wiser than he is, he will instantly commit himself and his possessions to you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span> <div class="sentence">  I think so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">103</span> <div class="sentence">  Aye, I said; and about your neighbour, too, does not the same rule hold as about your father?</div><div class="sentence"> If he is satisfied that you know more of housekeeping than he does, will he continue to administer his affairs himself, or will he commit them to you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span> <div class="sentence">  I think that he will commit them to me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span> <div class="sentence">  Will not the Athenian people, too, entrust their affairs to you when they see that you have wisdom enough to manage them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span> <div class="sentence">  And oh!</div><div class="sentence"> let me put another case, I said: There is the great king, and he has an eldest son, who is the Prince of Asia;—suppose that you and I go to him and establish to his satisfaction that we are better cooks than his son, will he not entrust to us the prerogative of making soup, and putting in anything that we like while the pot is boiling, rather than to the Prince of Asia, who is his son?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span> <div class="sentence">  To us, clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">109</span> <div class="sentence">  And we shall be allowed to throw in salt by handfuls, whereas the son will not be allowed to put in as much as he can take up between his fingers?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">111</span> <div class="sentence">  Or suppose again that the son has bad eyes, will he allow him, or will he not allow him, to touch his own eyes if he thinks that he has no knowledge of medicine?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">112</span> <div class="sentence">  He will not allow him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">113</span> <div class="sentence">  Whereas, if he supposes us to have a knowledge of medicine, he will allow us to do what we like with him—even to open the eyes wide and sprinkle ashes upon them, because he supposes that we know what is best?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">114</span> <div class="sentence">  That is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">115</span> <div class="sentence">  And everything in which we appear to him to be wiser than himself or his son he will commit to us?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">116</span> <div class="sentence">  That is very true, Socrates, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">117</span> <div class="sentence">  Then now, my dear Lysis, I said, you perceive that in things which we know every one will trust us,—Hellenes and barbarians, men and women,—and we may do as we please about them, and no one will like to interfere with us; we shall be free, and masters of others; and these things will be really ours, for we shall be benefited by them.</div><div class="sentence"> But in things of which we have no understanding, no one will trust us to do as seems good to us—they will hinder us as far as they can; and not only strangers, but father and mother, and the friend, if there be one, who is dearer still, will also hinder us; and we shall be subject to others; and these things will not be ours, for we shall not be benefited by them.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you agree?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">118</span> <div class="sentence">  He assented.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">119</span> <div class="sentence">  And shall we be friends to others, and will any others love us, in as far as we are useless to them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">120</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">121</span> <div class="sentence">  Neither can your father or mother love you, nor can anybody love anybody else, in so far as they are useless to them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">122</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">123</span> <div class="sentence">  And therefore, my boy, if you are wise, all men will be your friends and kindred, for you will be useful and good; but if you are not wise, neither father, nor mother, nor kindred, nor any one else, will be your friends.</div><div class="sentence"> And in matters of which you have as yet no knowledge, can you have any conceit of knowledge?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">124</span> <div class="sentence">  That is impossible, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">125</span> <div class="sentence">  And you, Lysis, if you require a teacher, have not yet attained to wisdom.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">126</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">127</span> <div class="sentence">  And therefore you are not conceited, having nothing of which to be conceited.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">128</span> <div class="sentence">  Indeed, Socrates, I think not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">129</span> <div class="sentence">  When I heard him say this, I turned to Hippothales, and was very nearly making a blunder, for I was going to say to him: That is the way, Hippothales, in which you should talk to your beloved, humbling and lowering him, and not as you do, puffing him up and spoiling him.</div><div class="sentence"> But I saw that he was in great excitement and confusion at what had been said, and I remembered that, although he was in the neighbourhood, he did not want to be seen by Lysis; so upon second thoughts I refrained.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">130</span> <div class="sentence">  In the meantime Menexenus came back and sat down in his place by Lysis; and Lysis, in a childish and affectionate manner, whispered privately in my ear, so that Menexenus should not hear: Do, Socrates, tell Menexenus what you have been telling me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">131</span> <div class="sentence">  Suppose that you tell him yourself, Lysis, I replied; for I am sure that you were attending.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">132</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">133</span> <div class="sentence">  Try, then, to remember the words, and be as exact as you can in repeating them to him, and if you have forgotten anything, ask me again the next time that you see me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">134</span> <div class="sentence">  I will be sure to do so, Socrates; but go on telling him something new, and let me hear, as long as I am allowed to stay.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">135</span> <div class="sentence">  I certainly cannot refuse, I said, since you ask me; but then, as you know, Menexenus is very pugnacious, and therefore you must come to the rescue if he attempts to upset me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">136</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, indeed, he said; he is very pugnacious, and that is the reason why I want you to argue with him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">137</span> <div class="sentence">  That I may make a fool of myself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">138</span> <div class="sentence">  No, indeed, he said; but I want you to put him down.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">139</span> <div class="sentence">  That is no easy matter, I replied; for he is a terrible fellow—a pupil of Ctesippus.</div><div class="sentence"> And there is Ctesippus himself: do you see him?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">140</span> <div class="sentence">  Never mind, Socrates, you shall argue with him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">141</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, I suppose that I must, I replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">142</span> <div class="sentence">  Hereupon Ctesippus complained that we were talking in secret, and keeping the feast to ourselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">143</span> <div class="sentence">  I shall be happy, I said, to let you have a share.</div><div class="sentence"> Here is Lysis, who does not understand something that I was saying, and wants me to ask Menexenus, who, as he thinks, is likely to know.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">144</span> <div class="sentence">  And why do you not ask him?</div><div class="sentence"> he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">145</span> <div class="sentence">  Very well, I said, I will; and do you, Menexenus, answer.</div><div class="sentence"> But first I must tell you that I am one who from my childhood upward have set my heart upon a certain thing.</div><div class="sentence"> All people have their fancies; some desire horses, and others dogs; and some are fond of gold, and others of honour.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, I have no violent desire of any of these things; but I have a passion for friends; and I would rather have a good friend than the best cock or quail in the world: I would even go further, and say the best horse or dog.</div><div class="sentence"> Yea, by the dog of Egypt, I should greatly prefer a real friend to all the gold of Darius, or even to Darius himself: I am such a lover of friends as that.</div><div class="sentence"> And when I see you and Lysis, at your early age, so easily possessed of this treasure, and so soon, he of you, and you of him, I am amazed and delighted, seeing that I myself, although I am now advanced in years, am so far from having made a similar acquisition, that I do not even know in what way a friend is acquired.</div><div class="sentence"> But I want to ask you a question about this, for you have experience: tell me then, when one loves another, is the lover or the beloved the friend; or may either be the friend?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">146</span> <div class="sentence">  Either may, I should think, be the friend of either.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">147</span> <div class="sentence">  Do you mean, I said, that if only one of them loves the other, they are mutual friends?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">148</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, he said; that is my meaning.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">149</span> <div class="sentence">  But what if the lover is not loved in return?</div><div class="sentence"> which is a very possible case.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">150</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">151</span> <div class="sentence">  Or is, perhaps, even hated?</div><div class="sentence"> which is a fancy which sometimes is entertained by lovers respecting their beloved.</div><div class="sentence"> Nothing can exceed their love; and yet they imagine either that they are not loved in return, or that they are hated.</div><div class="sentence"> Is not that true?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">152</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, he said, quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">153</span> <div class="sentence">  In that case, the one loves, and the other is loved?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">154</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">155</span> <div class="sentence">  Then which is the friend of which?</div><div class="sentence"> Is the lover the friend of the beloved, whether he be loved in return, or hated; or is the beloved the friend; or is there no friendship at all on either side, unless they both love one another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">156</span> <div class="sentence">  There would seem to be none at all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">157</span> <div class="sentence">  Then this notion is not in accordance with our previous one.</div><div class="sentence"> We were saying that both were friends, if one only loved; but now, unless they both love, neither is a friend.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">158</span> <div class="sentence">  That appears to be true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">159</span> <div class="sentence">  Then nothing which does not love in return is beloved by a lover?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">160</span> <div class="sentence">  I think not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">161</span> <div class="sentence">  Then they are not lovers of horses, whom the horses do not love in return; nor lovers of quails, nor of dogs, nor of wine, nor of gymnastic exercises, who have no return of love; no, nor of wisdom, unless wisdom loves them in return.</div><div class="sentence"> Or shall we say that they do love them, although they are not beloved by them; and that the poet was wrong who sings—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">162</span> <div class="sentence">  'Happy the man to whom his children are dear, and steeds having single hoofs, and dogs of chase, and the stranger of another land'?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">163</span> <div class="sentence">  I do not think that he was wrong.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">164</span> <div class="sentence">  You think that he is right?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">165</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">166</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, Menexenus, the conclusion is, that what is beloved, whether loving or hating, may be dear to the lover of it: for example, very young children, too young to love, or even hating their father or mother when they are punished by them, are never dearer to them than at the time when they are being hated by them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">167</span> <div class="sentence">  I think that what you say is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">168</span> <div class="sentence">  And, if so, not the lover, but the beloved, is the friend or dear one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">169</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">170</span> <div class="sentence">  And the hated one, and not the hater, is the enemy?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">171</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">172</span> <div class="sentence">  Then many men are loved by their enemies, and hated by their friends, and are the friends of their enemies, and the enemies of their friends.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet how absurd, my dear friend, or indeed impossible is this paradox of a man being an enemy to his friend or a friend to his enemy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">173</span> <div class="sentence">  I quite agree, Socrates, in what you say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">174</span> <div class="sentence">  But if this cannot be, the lover will be the friend of that which is loved?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">175</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">176</span> <div class="sentence">  And the hater will be the enemy of that which is hated?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">177</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">178</span> <div class="sentence">  Yet we must acknowledge in this, as in the preceding instance, that a man may be the friend of one who is not his friend, or who may be his enemy, when he loves that which does not love him or which even hates him.</div><div class="sentence"> And he may be the enemy of one who is not his enemy, and is even his friend: for example, when he hates that which does not hate him, or which even loves him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">179</span> <div class="sentence">  That appears to be true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">180</span> <div class="sentence">  But if the lover is not a friend, nor the beloved a friend, nor both together, what are we to say?</div><div class="sentence"> Whom are we to call friends to one another?</div><div class="sentence"> Do any remain?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">181</span> <div class="sentence">  Indeed, Socrates, I cannot find any.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">182</span> <div class="sentence">  But, O Menexenus!</div><div class="sentence"> I said, may we not have been altogether wrong in our conclusions?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">183</span> <div class="sentence">  I am sure that we have been wrong, Socrates, said Lysis.</div><div class="sentence"> And he blushed as he spoke, the words seeming to come from his lips involuntarily, because his whole mind was taken up with the argument; there was no mistaking his attentive look while he was listening.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">184</span> <div class="sentence">  I was pleased at the interest which was shown by Lysis, and I wanted to give Menexenus a rest, so I turned to him and said, I think, Lysis, that what you say is true, and that, if we had been right, we should never have gone so far wrong; let us proceed no further in this direction (for the road seems to be getting troublesome), but take the other path into which we turned, and see what the poets have to say; for they are to us in a manner the fathers and authors of wisdom, and they speak of friends in no light or trivial manner, but God himself, as they say, makes them and draws them to one another; and this they express, if I am not mistaken, in the following words:—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">185</span> <div class="sentence">  'God is ever drawing like towards like, and making them acquainted.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">186</span> <div class="sentence">  I dare say that you have heard those words.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">187</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, he said; I have.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">188</span> <div class="sentence">  And have you not also met with the treatises of philosophers who say that like must love like?</div><div class="sentence"> they are the people who argue and write about nature and the universe.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">189</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">190</span> <div class="sentence">  And are they right in saying this?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">191</span> <div class="sentence">  They may be.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">192</span> <div class="sentence">  Perhaps, I said, about half, or possibly, altogether, right, if their meaning were rightly apprehended by us.</div><div class="sentence"> For the more a bad man has to do with a bad man, and the more nearly he is brought into contact with him, the more he will be likely to hate him, for he injures him; and injurer and injured cannot be friends.</div><div class="sentence"> Is not that true?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">193</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">194</span> <div class="sentence">  Then one half of the saying is untrue, if the wicked are like one another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">195</span> <div class="sentence">  That is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">196</span> <div class="sentence">  But the real meaning of the saying, as I imagine, is, that the good are like one another, and friends to one another; and that the bad, as is often said of them, are never at unity with one another or with themselves; for they are passionate and restless, and anything which is at variance and enmity with itself is not likely to be in union or harmony with any other thing.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you not agree?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">197</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, I do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">198</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, my friend, those who say that the like is friendly to the like mean to intimate, if I rightly apprehend them, that the good only is the friend of the good, and of him only; but that the evil never attains to any real friendship, either with good or evil.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you agree?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">199</span> <div class="sentence">  He nodded assent.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">200</span> <div class="sentence">  Then now we know how to answer the question 'Who are friends?'</div><div class="sentence"> for the argument declares 'That the good are friends.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">201</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, he said, that is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">202</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, I replied; and yet I am not quite satisfied with this answer.</div><div class="sentence"> By heaven, and shall I tell you what I suspect?</div><div class="sentence"> I will.</div><div class="sentence"> Assuming that like, inasmuch as he is like, is the friend of like, and useful to him—or rather let me try another way of putting the matter: Can like do any good or harm to like which he could not do to himself, or suffer anything from his like which he would not suffer from himself?</div><div class="sentence"> And if neither can be of any use to the other, how can they be loved by one another?</div><div class="sentence"> Can they now?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">203</span> <div class="sentence">  They cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">204</span> <div class="sentence">  And can he who is not loved be a friend?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">205</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">206</span> <div class="sentence">  But say that the like is not the friend of the like in so far as he is like; still the good may be the friend of the good in so far as he is good?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">207</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">208</span> <div class="sentence">  But then again, will not the good, in so far as he is good, be sufficient for himself?</div><div class="sentence"> Certainly he will.</div><div class="sentence"> And he who is sufficient wants nothing—that is implied in the word sufficient.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">209</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">210</span> <div class="sentence">  And he who wants nothing will desire nothing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">211</span> <div class="sentence">  He will not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">212</span> <div class="sentence">  Neither can he love that which he does not desire?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">213</span> <div class="sentence">  He cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">214</span> <div class="sentence">  And he who loves not is not a lover or friend?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">215</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">216</span> <div class="sentence">  What place then is there for friendship, if, when absent, good men have no need of one another (for even when alone they are sufficient for themselves), and when present have no use of one another?</div><div class="sentence"> How can such persons ever be induced to value one another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">217</span> <div class="sentence">  They cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">218</span> <div class="sentence">  And friends they cannot be, unless they value one another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">219</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">220</span> <div class="sentence">  But see now, Lysis, whether we are not being deceived in all this—are we not indeed entirely wrong?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">221</span> <div class="sentence">  How so?</div><div class="sentence"> he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">222</span> <div class="sentence">  Have I not heard some one say, as I just now recollect, that the like is the greatest enemy of the like, the good of the good?—Yes, and he quoted the authority of Hesiod, who says:</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">223</span> <div class="sentence">  'Potter quarrels with potter, bard with bard, Beggar with beggar;'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">224</span> <div class="sentence">  and of all other things he affirmed, in like manner, 'That of necessity the most like are most full of envy, strife, and hatred of one another, and the most unlike, of friendship.</div><div class="sentence"> For the poor man is compelled to be the friend of the rich, and the weak requires the aid of the strong, and the sick man of the physician; and every one who is ignorant, has to love and court him who knows.'</div><div class="sentence"> And indeed he went on to say in grandiloquent language, that the idea of friendship existing between similars is not the truth, but the very reverse of the truth, and that the most opposed are the most friendly; for that everything desires not like but that which is most unlike: for example, the dry desires the moist, the cold the hot, the bitter the sweet, the sharp the blunt, the void the full, the full the void, and so of all other things; for the opposite is the food of the opposite, whereas like receives nothing from like.</div><div class="sentence"> And I thought that he who said this was a charming man, and that he spoke well.</div><div class="sentence"> What do the rest of you say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">225</span> <div class="sentence">  I should say, at first hearing, that he is right, said Menexenus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">226</span> <div class="sentence">  Then we are to say that the greatest friendship is of opposites?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">227</span> <div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">228</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, Menexenus; but will not that be a monstrous answer?</div><div class="sentence"> and will not the all-wise eristics be down upon us in triumph, and ask, fairly enough, whether love is not the very opposite of hate; and what answer shall we make to them—must we not admit that they speak the truth?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">229</span> <div class="sentence">  We must.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">230</span> <div class="sentence">  They will then proceed to ask whether the enemy is the friend of the friend, or the friend the friend of the enemy?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">231</span> <div class="sentence">  Neither, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">232</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, but is a just man the friend of the unjust, or the temperate of the intemperate, or the good of the bad?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">233</span> <div class="sentence">  I do not see how that is possible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">234</span> <div class="sentence">  And yet, I said, if friendship goes by contraries, the contraries must be friends.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">235</span> <div class="sentence">  They must.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">236</span> <div class="sentence">  Then neither like and like nor unlike and unlike are friends.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">237</span> <div class="sentence">  I suppose not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">238</span> <div class="sentence">  And yet there is a further consideration: may not all these notions of friendship be erroneous?</div><div class="sentence"> but may not that which is neither good nor evil still in some cases be the friend of the good?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">239</span> <div class="sentence">  How do you mean?</div><div class="sentence"> he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">240</span> <div class="sentence">  Why really, I said, the truth is that I do not know; but my head is dizzy with thinking of the argument, and therefore I hazard the conjecture, that 'the beautiful is the friend,' as the old proverb says.</div><div class="sentence"> Beauty is certainly a soft, smooth, slippery thing, and therefore of a nature which easily slips in and permeates our souls.</div><div class="sentence"> For I affirm that the good is the beautiful.</div><div class="sentence"> You will agree to that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">241</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">242</span> <div class="sentence">  This I say from a sort of notion that what is neither good nor evil is the friend of the beautiful and the good, and I will tell you why I am inclined to think so: I assume that there are three principles—the good, the bad, and that which is neither good nor bad.</div><div class="sentence"> You would agree—would you not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">243</span> <div class="sentence">  I agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">244</span> <div class="sentence">  And neither is the good the friend of the good, nor the evil of the evil, nor the good of the evil;—these alternatives are excluded by the previous argument; and therefore, if there be such a thing as friendship or love at all, we must infer that what is neither good nor evil must be the friend, either of the good, or of that which is neither good nor evil, for nothing can be the friend of the bad.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">245</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">246</span> <div class="sentence">  But neither can like be the friend of like, as we were just now saying.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">247</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">248</span> <div class="sentence">  And if so, that which is neither good nor evil can have no friend which is neither good nor evil.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">249</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">250</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the good alone is the friend of that only which is neither good nor evil.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">251</span> <div class="sentence">  That may be assumed to be certain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">252</span> <div class="sentence">  And does not this seem to put us in the right way?</div><div class="sentence"> Just remark, that the body which is in health requires neither medical nor any other aid, but is well enough; and the healthy man has no love of the physician, because he is in health.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">253</span> <div class="sentence">  He has none.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">254</span> <div class="sentence">  But the sick loves him, because he is sick?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">255</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">256</span> <div class="sentence">  And sickness is an evil, and the art of medicine a good and useful thing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">257</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">258</span> <div class="sentence">  But the human body, regarded as a body, is neither good nor evil?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">259</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">260</span> <div class="sentence">  And the body is compelled by reason of disease to court and make friends of the art of medicine?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">261</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">262</span> <div class="sentence">  Then that which is neither good nor evil becomes the friend of good, by reason of the presence of evil?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">263</span> <div class="sentence">  So we may infer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">264</span> <div class="sentence">  And clearly this must have happened before that which was neither good nor evil had become altogether corrupted with the element of evil—if itself had become evil it would not still desire and love the good; for, as we were saying, the evil cannot be the friend of the good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">265</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">266</span> <div class="sentence">  Further, I must observe that some substances are assimilated when others are present with them; and there are some which are not assimilated: take, for example, the case of an ointment or colour which is put on another substance.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">267</span> <div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">268</span> <div class="sentence">  In such a case, is the substance which is anointed the same as the colour or ointment?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">269</span> <div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div><div class="sentence"> he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">270</span> <div class="sentence">  This is what I mean: Suppose that I were to cover your auburn locks with white lead, would they be really white, or would they only appear to be white?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">271</span> <div class="sentence">  They would only appear to be white, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">272</span> <div class="sentence">  And yet whiteness would be present in them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">273</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">274</span> <div class="sentence">  But that would not make them at all the more white, notwithstanding the presence of white in them—they would not be white any more than black?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">275</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">276</span> <div class="sentence">  But when old age infuses whiteness into them, then they become assimilated, and are white by the presence of white.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">277</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">278</span> <div class="sentence">  Now I want to know whether in all cases a substance is assimilated by the presence of another substance; or must the presence be after a peculiar sort?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">279</span> <div class="sentence">  The latter, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">280</span> <div class="sentence">  Then that which is neither good nor evil may be in the presence of evil, but not as yet evil, and that has happened before now?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">281</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">282</span> <div class="sentence">  And when anything is in the presence of evil, not being as yet evil, the presence of good arouses the desire of good in that thing; but the presence of evil, which makes a thing evil, takes away the desire and friendship of the good; for that which was once both good and evil has now become evil only, and the good was supposed to have no friendship with the evil?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">283</span> <div class="sentence">  None.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">284</span> <div class="sentence">  And therefore we say that those who are already wise, whether Gods or men, are no longer lovers of wisdom; nor can they be lovers of wisdom who are ignorant to the extent of being evil, for no evil or ignorant person is a lover of wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> There remain those who have the misfortune to be ignorant, but are not yet hardened in their ignorance, or void of understanding, and do not as yet fancy that they know what they do not know: and therefore those who are the lovers of wisdom are as yet neither good nor bad.</div><div class="sentence"> But the bad do not love wisdom any more than the good; for, as we have already seen, neither is unlike the friend of unlike, nor like of like.</div><div class="sentence"> You remember that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">285</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, they both said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">286</span> <div class="sentence">  And so, Lysis and Menexenus, we have discovered the nature of friendship—there can be no doubt of it: Friendship is the love which by reason of the presence of evil the neither good nor evil has of the good, either in the soul, or in the body, or anywhere.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">287</span> <div class="sentence">  They both agreed and entirely assented, and for a moment I rejoiced and was satisfied like a huntsman just holding fast his prey.</div><div class="sentence"> But then a most unaccountable suspicion came across me, and I felt that the conclusion was untrue.</div><div class="sentence"> I was pained, and said, Alas!</div><div class="sentence"> Lysis and Menexenus, I am afraid that we have been grasping at a shadow only.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">288</span> <div class="sentence">  Why do you say so?</div><div class="sentence"> said Menexenus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">289</span> <div class="sentence">  I am afraid, I said, that the argument about friendship is false: arguments, like men, are often pretenders.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">290</span> <div class="sentence">  How do you mean?</div><div class="sentence"> he asked.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">291</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, I said; look at the matter in this way: a friend is the friend of some one; is he not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">292</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly he is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">293</span> <div class="sentence">  And has he a motive and object in being a friend, or has he no motive and object?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">294</span> <div class="sentence">  He has a motive and object.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">295</span> <div class="sentence">  And is the object which makes him a friend, dear to him, or neither dear nor hateful to him?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">296</span> <div class="sentence">  I do not quite follow you, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">297</span> <div class="sentence">  I do not wonder at that, I said.</div><div class="sentence"> But perhaps, if I put the matter in another way, you will be able to follow me, and my own meaning will be clearer to myself.</div><div class="sentence"> The sick man, as I was just now saying, is the friend of the physician—is he not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">298</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">299</span> <div class="sentence">  And he is the friend of the physician because of disease, and for the sake of health?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">300</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">301</span> <div class="sentence">  And disease is an evil?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">302</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">303</span> <div class="sentence">  And what of health?</div><div class="sentence"> I said.</div><div class="sentence"> Is that good or evil, or neither?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">304</span> <div class="sentence">  Good, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">305</span> <div class="sentence">  And we were saying, I believe, that the body being neither good nor evil, because of disease, that is to say because of evil, is the friend of medicine, and medicine is a good: and medicine has entered into this friendship for the sake of health, and health is a good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">306</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">307</span> <div class="sentence">  And is health a friend, or not a friend?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">308</span> <div class="sentence">  A friend.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">309</span> <div class="sentence">  And disease is an enemy?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">310</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">311</span> <div class="sentence">  Then that which is neither good nor evil is the friend of the good because of the evil and hateful, and for the sake of the good and the friend?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">312</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">313</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the friend is a friend for the sake of the friend, and because of the enemy?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">314</span> <div class="sentence">  That is to be inferred.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">315</span> <div class="sentence">  Then at this point, my boys, let us take heed, and be on our guard against deceptions.</div><div class="sentence"> I will not again repeat that the friend is the friend of the friend, and the like of the like, which has been declared by us to be an impossibility; but, in order that this new statement may not delude us, let us attentively examine another point, which I will proceed to explain: Medicine, as we were saying, is a friend, or dear to us for the sake of health?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">316</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">317</span> <div class="sentence">  And health is also dear?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">318</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">319</span> <div class="sentence">  And if dear, then dear for the sake of something?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">320</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">321</span> <div class="sentence">  And surely this object must also be dear, as is implied in our previous admissions?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">322</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">323</span> <div class="sentence">  And that something dear involves something else dear?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">324</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">325</span> <div class="sentence">  But then, proceeding in this way, shall we not arrive at some first principle of friendship or dearness which is not capable of being referred to any other, for the sake of which, as we maintain, all other things are dear, and, having there arrived, we shall stop?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">326</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">327</span> <div class="sentence">  My fear is that all those other things, which, as we say, are dear for the sake of another, are illusions and deceptions only, but where that first principle is, there is the true ideal of friendship.</div><div class="sentence"> Let me put the matter thus: Suppose the case of a great treasure (this may be a son, who is more precious to his father than all his other treasures); would not the father, who values his son above all things, value other things also for the sake of his son?</div><div class="sentence"> I mean, for instance, if he knew that his son had drunk hemlock, and the father thought that wine would save him, he would value the wine?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">328</span> <div class="sentence">  He would.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">329</span> <div class="sentence">  And also the vessel which contains the wine?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">330</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">331</span> <div class="sentence">  But does he therefore value the three measures of wine, or the earthen vessel which contains them, equally with his son?</div><div class="sentence"> Is not this rather the true state of the case?</div><div class="sentence"> All his anxiety has regard not to the means which are provided for the sake of an object, but to the object for the sake of which they are provided.</div><div class="sentence"> And although we may often say that gold and silver are highly valued by us, that is not the truth; for there is a further object, whatever it may be, which we value most of all, and for the sake of which gold and all our other possessions are acquired by us.</div><div class="sentence"> Am I not right?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">332</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">333</span> <div class="sentence">  And may not the same be said of the friend?</div><div class="sentence"> That which is only dear to us for the sake of something else is improperly said to be dear, but the truly dear is that in which all these so-called dear friendships terminate.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">334</span> <div class="sentence">  That, he said, appears to be true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">335</span> <div class="sentence">  And the truly dear or ultimate principle of friendship is not for the sake of any other or further dear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">336</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">337</span> <div class="sentence">  Then we have done with the notion that friendship has any further object.</div><div class="sentence"> May we then infer that the good is the friend?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">338</span> <div class="sentence">  I think so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">339</span> <div class="sentence">  And the good is loved for the sake of the evil?</div><div class="sentence"> Let me put the case in this way: Suppose that of the three principles, good, evil, and that which is neither good nor evil, there remained only the good and the neutral, and that evil went far away, and in no way affected soul or body, nor ever at all that class of things which, as we say, are neither good nor evil in themselves;—would the good be of any use, or other than useless to us?</div><div class="sentence"> For if there were nothing to hurt us any longer, we should have no need of anything that would do us good.</div><div class="sentence"> Then would be clearly seen that we did but love and desire the good because of the evil, and as the remedy of the evil, which was the disease; but if there had been no disease, there would have been no need of a remedy.</div><div class="sentence"> Is not this the nature of the good—to be loved by us who are placed between the two, because of the evil?</div><div class="sentence"> but there is no use in the good for its own sake.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">340</span> <div class="sentence">  I suppose not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">341</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the final principle of friendship, in which all other friendships terminated, those, I mean, which are relatively dear and for the sake of something else, is of another and a different nature from them.</div><div class="sentence"> For they are called dear because of another dear or friend.</div><div class="sentence"> But with the true friend or dear, the case is quite the reverse; for that is proved to be dear because of the hated, and if the hated were away it would be no longer dear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">342</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true, he replied: at any rate not if our present view holds good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">343</span> <div class="sentence">  But, oh!</div><div class="sentence"> will you tell me, I said, whether if evil were to perish, we should hunger any more, or thirst any more, or have any similar desire?</div><div class="sentence"> Or may we suppose that hunger will remain while men and animals remain, but not so as to be hurtful?</div><div class="sentence"> And the same of thirst and the other desires,—that they will remain, but will not be evil because evil has perished?</div><div class="sentence"> Or rather shall I say, that to ask what either will be then or will not be is ridiculous, for who knows?</div><div class="sentence"> This we do know, that in our present condition hunger may injure us, and may also benefit us:—Is not that true?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">344</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">345</span> <div class="sentence">  And in like manner thirst or any similar desire may sometimes be a good and sometimes an evil to us, and sometimes neither one nor the other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">346</span> <div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">347</span> <div class="sentence">  But is there any reason why, because evil perishes, that which is not evil should perish with it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">348</span> <div class="sentence">  None.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">349</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, even if evil perishes, the desires which are neither good nor evil will remain?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">350</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly they will.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">351</span> <div class="sentence">  And must not a man love that which he desires and affects?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">352</span> <div class="sentence">  He must.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">353</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, even if evil perishes, there may still remain some elements of love or friendship?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">354</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">355</span> <div class="sentence">  But not if evil is the cause of friendship: for in that case nothing will be the friend of any other thing after the destruction of evil; for the effect cannot remain when the cause is destroyed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">356</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">357</span> <div class="sentence">  And have we not admitted already that the friend loves something for a reason?</div><div class="sentence"> and at the time of making the admission we were of opinion that the neither good nor evil loves the good because of the evil?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">358</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">359</span> <div class="sentence">  But now our view is changed, and we conceive that there must be some other cause of friendship?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">360</span> <div class="sentence">  I suppose so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">361</span> <div class="sentence">  May not the truth be rather, as we were saying just now, that desire is the cause of friendship; for that which desires is dear to that which is desired at the time of desiring it?</div><div class="sentence"> and may not the other theory have been only a long story about nothing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">362</span> <div class="sentence">  Likely enough.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">363</span> <div class="sentence">  But surely, I said, he who desires, desires that of which he is in want?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">364</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">365</span> <div class="sentence">  And that of which he is in want is dear to him?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">366</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">367</span> <div class="sentence">  And he is in want of that of which he is deprived?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">368</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">369</span> <div class="sentence">  Then love, and desire, and friendship would appear to be of the natural or congenial.</div><div class="sentence"> Such, Lysis and Menexenus, is the inference.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">370</span> <div class="sentence">  They assented.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">371</span> <div class="sentence">  Then if you are friends, you must have natures which are congenial to one another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">372</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly, they both said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">373</span> <div class="sentence">  And I say, my boys, that no one who loves or desires another would ever have loved or desired or affected him, if he had not been in some way congenial to him, either in his soul, or in his character, or in his manners, or in his form.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">374</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, yes, said Menexenus.</div><div class="sentence"> But Lysis was silent.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">375</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, I said, the conclusion is, that what is of a congenial nature must be loved.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">376</span> <div class="sentence">  It follows, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">377</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the lover, who is true and no counterfeit, must of necessity be loved by his love.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">378</span> <div class="sentence">  Lysis and Menexenus gave a faint assent to this; and Hippothales changed into all manner of colours with delight.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">379</span> <div class="sentence">  Here, intending to revise the argument, I said: Can we point out any difference between the congenial and the like?</div><div class="sentence"> For if that is possible, then I think, Lysis and Menexenus, there may be some sense in our argument about friendship.</div><div class="sentence"> But if the congenial is only the like, how will you get rid of the other argument, of the uselessness of like to like in as far as they are like; for to say that what is useless is dear, would be absurd?</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose, then, that we agree to distinguish between the congenial and the like—in the intoxication of argument, that may perhaps be allowed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">380</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">381</span> <div class="sentence">  And shall we further say that the good is congenial, and the evil uncongenial to every one?</div><div class="sentence"> Or again that the evil is congenial to the evil, and the good to the good; and that which is neither good nor evil to that which is neither good nor evil?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">382</span> <div class="sentence">  They agreed to the latter alternative.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">383</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, my boys, we have again fallen into the old discarded error; for the unjust will be the friend of the unjust, and the bad of the bad, as well as the good of the good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">384</span> <div class="sentence">  That appears to be the result.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">385</span> <div class="sentence">  But again, if we say that the congenial is the same as the good, in that case the good and he only will be the friend of the good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">386</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">387</span> <div class="sentence">  But that too was a position of ours which, as you will remember, has been already refuted by ourselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">388</span> <div class="sentence">  We remember.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">389</span> <div class="sentence">  Then what is to be done?</div><div class="sentence"> Or rather is there anything to be done?</div><div class="sentence"> I can only, like the wise men who argue in courts, sum up the arguments:—If neither the beloved, nor the lover, nor the like, nor the unlike, nor the good, nor the congenial, nor any other of whom we spoke—for there were such a number of them that I cannot remember all—if none of these are friends, I know not what remains to be said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">390</span> <div class="sentence">  Here I was going to invite the opinion of some older person, when suddenly we were interrupted by the tutors of Lysis and Menexenus, who came upon us like an evil apparition with their brothers, and bade them go home, as it was getting late.</div><div class="sentence"> At first, we and the by-standers drove them off; but afterwards, as they would not mind, and only went on shouting in their barbarous dialect, and got angry, and kept calling the boys—they appeared to us to have been drinking rather too much at the Hermaea, which made them difficult to manage—we fairly gave way and broke up the company.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">391</span> <div class="sentence">  I said, however, a few words to the boys at parting: O Menexenus and Lysis, how ridiculous that you two boys, and I, an old boy, who would fain be one of you, should imagine ourselves to be friends—this is what the by-standers will go away and say—and as yet we have not been able to discover what is a friend!</div></div>
