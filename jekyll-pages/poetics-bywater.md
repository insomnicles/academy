<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  In the tenth book of the Republic, when Plato has completed his final burning denunciation of Poetry, the false Siren, the imitator of things which themselves are shadows, the ally of all that is low and weak in the soul against that which is high and strong, who makes us feed the things we ought to starve and serve the things we ought to rule, he ends with a touch of compunction: 'We will give her champions, not poets themselves but poet-lovers, an opportunity to make her defence in plain prose and show that she is not only sweet—as we well know—but also helpful to society and the life of man, and we will listen in a kindly spirit.</div><div class="sentence"> For we shall be gainers, I take it, if this can be proved.'</div><div class="sentence"> Aristotle certainly knew the passage, and it looks as if his treatise on poetry was an answer to Plato's challenge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Few of the great works of ancient Greek literature are easy reading.</div><div class="sentence"> They nearly all need study and comment, and at times help from a good teacher, before they yield up their secret.</div><div class="sentence"> And the Poetics cannot be accounted an exception.</div><div class="sentence"> For one thing the treatise is fragmentary.</div><div class="sentence"> It originally consisted of two books, one dealing with Tragedy and Epic, the other with Comedy and other subjects.</div><div class="sentence"> We possess only the first.</div><div class="sentence"> For another, even the book we have seems to be unrevised and unfinished.</div><div class="sentence"> The style, though luminous, vivid, and in its broader division systematic, is not that of a book intended for publication.</div><div class="sentence"> Like most of Aristotle's extant writing, it suggests the MS. of an experienced lecturer, full of jottings and adscripts, with occasional phrases written carefully out, but never revised as a whole for the general reader.</div><div class="sentence"> Even to accomplished scholars the meaning is often obscure, as may be seen by a comparison of the three editions recently published in England, all the work of savants of the first eminence, (1) or, still more strikingly, by a study of the long series of misunderstandings and overstatements and corrections which form the history of the Poetics since the Renaissance.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  (1) Prof. Butcher, 1895 and 1898; Prof. Bywater, 1909; and Prof. Margoliouth, 1911.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  But it is of another cause of misunderstanding that I wish principally to speak in this preface.</div><div class="sentence"> The great edition from which the present translation is taken was the fruit of prolonged study by one of the greatest Aristotelians of the nineteenth century, and is itself a classic among works of scholarship.</div><div class="sentence"> In the hands of a student who knows even a little Greek, the translation, backed by the commentary, may lead deep into the mind of Aristotle.</div><div class="sentence"> But when the translation is used, as it doubtless will be, by readers who are quite without the clue provided by a knowledge of the general habits of the Greek language, there must arise a number of new difficulties or misconceptions.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  To understand a great foreign book by means of a translation is possible enough where the two languages concerned operate with a common stock of ideas, and belong to the same period of civilization.</div><div class="sentence"> But between ancient Greece and modern England there yawn immense gulfs of human history; the establishment and the partial failure of a common European religion, the barbarian invasions, the feudal system, the regrouping of modern Europe, the age of mechanical invention, and the industrial revolution.</div><div class="sentence"> In an average page of French or German philosophy nearly all the nouns can be translated directly into exact equivalents in English; but in Greek that is not so.</div><div class="sentence"> Scarcely one in ten of the nouns on the first few pages of the Poetics has an exact English equivalent.</div><div class="sentence"> Every proposition has to be reduced to its lowest terms of thought and then re-built.</div><div class="sentence"> This is a difficulty which no translation can quite deal with; it must be left to a teacher who knows Greek.</div><div class="sentence"> And there is a kindred difficulty which flows from it.</div><div class="sentence"> Where words can be translated into equivalent words, the style of an original can be closely followed; but no translation which aims at being written in normal English can reproduce the style of Aristotle.</div><div class="sentence"> I have sometimes played with the idea that a ruthlessly literal translation, helped out by bold punctuation, might be the best.</div><div class="sentence"> For instance, premising that the words poesis, poetes mean originally 'making' and 'maker', one might translate the first paragraph of the Poetics thus:—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  MAKING: kinds of making: function of each, and how the Myths ought to be put together if the Making is to go right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  Number of parts: nature of parts: rest of same inquiry.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  Begin in order of nature from first principles.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span> <div class="sentence">  Epos-making, tragedy-making (also comedy), dithyramb-making (and most fluting and harping), taken as a whole, are really not Makings but Imitations.</div><div class="sentence"> They differ in three points; they imitate (a) different objects, (b) by different means, (c) differently (i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> different manner).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span> <div class="sentence">  Some artists imitate (i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> depict) by shapes and colours.</div><div class="sentence"> (Obs.</div><div class="sentence"> sometimes by art, sometimes by habit.)</div><div class="sentence"> Some by voice.</div><div class="sentence"> Similarly the above arts all imitate by rhythm, language, and tune, and these either (1) separate or (2) mixed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span> <div class="sentence">  Rhythm and tune alone, harping, fluting, and other arts with same effect—e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> panpipes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span> <div class="sentence">  Rhythm without tune: dancing.</div><div class="sentence"> (Dancers imitate characters, emotions, and experiences by means of rhythms expressed in form.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span> <div class="sentence">  Language alone (whether prose or verse, and one form of verse or many): this art has no name up to the present (i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> there is no name to cover mimes and dialogues and any similar imitation made in iambics, elegiacs, &c. Commonly people attach the 'making' to the metre and say 'elegiac-makers', 'hexameter-makers,' giving them a common class-name by their metre, as if it was not their imitation that makes them 'makers').</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span> <div class="sentence">  Such an experiment would doubtless be a little absurd, but it would give an English reader some help in understanding both Aristotle's style and his meaning.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span> <div class="sentence">  For example, their enlightenment in the literal phrase, 'how the myths ought to be put together.'</div><div class="sentence"> The higher Greek poetry did not make up fictitious plots; its business was to express the heroic saga, the myths.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, the literal translation of poetes, poet, as 'maker', helps to explain a term that otherwise seems a puzzle in the Poetics.</div><div class="sentence"> If we wonder why Aristotle, and Plato before him, should lay such stress on the theory that art is imitation, it is a help to realize that common language called it 'making', and it was clearly not 'making' in the ordinary sense.</div><div class="sentence"> The poet who was 'maker' of a Fall of Troy clearly did not make the real Fall of Troy.</div><div class="sentence"> He made an imitation Fall of Troy.</div><div class="sentence"> An artist who 'painted Pericles' really 'made an imitation Pericles by means of shapes and colours'.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence we get started upon a theory of art which, whether finally satisfactory or not, is of immense importance, and are saved from the error of complaining that Aristotle did not understand the 'creative power' of art.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span> <div class="sentence">  As a rule, no doubt, the difficulty, even though merely verbal, lies beyond the reach of so simple a tool as literal translation.</div><div class="sentence"> To say that tragedy 'imitates good men' while comedy 'imitates bad men' strikes a modern reader as almost meaningless.</div><div class="sentence"> The truth is that neither 'good' nor 'bad' is an exact equivalent of the Greek.</div><div class="sentence"> It would be nearer perhaps to say that, relatively speaking, you look up to the characters of tragedy, and down upon those of comedy.</div><div class="sentence"> High or low, serious or trivial, many other pairs of words would have to be called in, in order to cover the wide range of the common Greek words.</div><div class="sentence"> And the point is important, because we have to consider whether in Chapter VI Aristotle really lays it down that tragedy, so far from being the story of un-happiness that we think it, is properly an imitation of eudaimonia—a word often translated 'happiness', but meaning something more like 'high life' or 'blessedness'.</div><div class="sentence"> (1)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span> <div class="sentence">  (1) See Margoliouth, p. 121.</div><div class="sentence"> By water, with most editors, emends the text.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span> <div class="sentence">  Another difficult word which constantly recurs in the Poetics is prattein or praxis, generally translated 'to act' or 'action'.</div><div class="sentence"> But prattein, like our 'do', also has an intransitive meaning 'to fare' either well or ill; and Professor Margoliouth has pointed out that it seems more true to say that tragedy shows how men 'fare' than how they 'act'.</div><div class="sentence"> It shows their experiences or fortunes rather than merely their deeds.</div><div class="sentence"> But one must not draw the line too bluntly.</div><div class="sentence"> I should doubt whether a classical Greek writer was ordinarily conscious of the distinction between the two meanings.</div><div class="sentence"> Certainly it is easier to regard happiness as a way of faring than as a form of action.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet Aristotle can use the passive of prattein for things 'done' or 'gone through' (e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> 52a, 22, 29: 55a, 25).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span> <div class="sentence">  The fact is that much misunderstanding is often caused by our modern attempts to limit too strictly the meaning of a Greek word.</div><div class="sentence"> Greek was very much a live language, and a language still unconscious of grammar, not, like ours, dominated by definitions and trained upon dictionaries.</div><div class="sentence"> An instance is provided by Aristotle's famous saying that the typical tragic hero is one who falls from high state or fame, not through vice or depravity, but by some great hamartia.</div><div class="sentence"> Hamartia means originally a 'bad shot' or 'error', but is currently used for 'offence' or 'sin'.</div><div class="sentence"> Aristotle clearly means that the typical hero is a great man with 'something wrong' in his life or character; but I think it is a mistake of method to argue whether he means 'an intellectual error' or 'a moral flaw'.</div><div class="sentence"> The word is not so precise.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span> <div class="sentence">  Similarly, when Aristotle says that a deed of strife or disaster is more tragic when it occurs 'amid affections' or 'among people who love each other', no doubt the phrase, as Aristotle's own examples show, would primarily suggest to a Greek feuds between near relations.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet some of the meaning is lost if one translates simply 'within the family'.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span> <div class="sentence">  There is another series of obscurities or confusions in the Poetics which, unless I am mistaken, arises from the fact that Aristotle was writing at a time when the great age of Greek tragedy was long past, and was using language formed in previous generations.</div><div class="sentence"> The words and phrases remained in the tradition, but the forms of art and activity which they denoted had sometimes changed in the interval.</div><div class="sentence"> If we date the Poetics about the year 330 B.C., as seems probable, that is more than two hundred years after the first tragedy of Thespis was produced in Athens, and more than seventy after the death of the last great masters of the tragic stage.</div><div class="sentence"> When we remember that a training in music and poetry formed a prominent part of the education of every wellborn Athenian, we cannot be surprised at finding in Aristotle, and to a less extent in Plato, considerable traces of a tradition of technical language and even of aesthetic theory.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span> <div class="sentence">  It is doubtless one of Aristotle's great services that he conceived so clearly the truth that literature is a thing that grows and has a history.</div><div class="sentence"> But no writer, certainly no ancient writer, is always vigilant.</div><div class="sentence"> Sometimes Aristotle analyses his terms, but very often he takes them for granted; and in the latter case, I think, he is sometimes deceived by them.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus there seem to be cases where he has been affected in his conceptions of fifth-century tragedy by the practice of his own day, when the only living form of drama was the New Comedy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span> <div class="sentence">  For example, as we have noticed above, true Tragedy had always taken its material from the sacred myths, or heroic sagas, which to the classical Greek constituted history.</div><div class="sentence"> But the New Comedy was in the habit of inventing its plots.</div><div class="sentence"> Consequently Aristotle falls into using the word mythos practically in the sense of 'plot', and writing otherwise in a way that is unsuited to the tragedy of the fifth century.</div><div class="sentence"> He says that tragedy adheres to 'the historical names' for an aesthetic reason, because what has happened is obviously possible and therefore convincing.</div><div class="sentence"> The real reason was that the drama and the myth were simply two different expressions of the same religious kernel (p. 44).</div><div class="sentence"> Again, he says of the Chorus (p. 65) that it should be an integral part of the play, which is true; but he also says that it' should be regarded as one of the actors', which shows to what an extent the Chorus in his day was dead and its technique forgotten.</div><div class="sentence"> He had lost the sense of what the Chorus was in the hands of the great masters, say in the Bacchae or the Eumenides.</div><div class="sentence"> He mistakes, again, the use of that epiphany of a God which is frequent at the end of the single plays of Euripides, and which seems to have been equally so at the end of the trilogies of Aeschylus.</div><div class="sentence"> Having lost the living tradition, he sees neither the ritual origin nor the dramatic value of these divine epiphanies.</div><div class="sentence"> He thinks of the convenient gods and abstractions who sometimes spoke the prologues of the New Comedy, and imagines that the God appears in order to unravel the plot.</div><div class="sentence"> As a matter of fact, in one play which he often quotes, the Iphigenia Taurica, the plot is actually distorted at the very end in order to give an opportunity for the epiphany.</div><div class="sentence"> (1)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span> <div class="sentence">  (1) See my Euripides and his Age, pp.</div><div class="sentence"> 221-45.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span> <div class="sentence">  One can see the effect of the tradition also in his treatment of the terms Anagnorisis and Peripeteia, which Professor Bywater translates as 'Discovery and Peripety' and Professor Butcher as 'Recognition and Reversal of Fortune'.</div><div class="sentence"> Aristotle assumes that these two elements are normally present in any tragedy, except those which he calls 'simple'; we may say, roughly, in any tragedy that really has a plot.</div><div class="sentence"> This strikes a modern reader as a very arbitrary assumption.</div><div class="sentence"> Reversals of Fortune of some sort are perhaps usual in any varied plot, but surely not Recognitions?</div><div class="sentence"> The clue to the puzzle lies, it can scarcely be doubted, in the historical origin of tragedy.</div><div class="sentence"> Tragedy, according to Greek tradition, is originally the ritual play of Dionysus, performed at his festival, and representing, as Herodotus tells us, the 'sufferings' or 'passion' of that God.</div><div class="sentence"> We are never directly told what these 'sufferings' were which were so represented; but Herodotus remarks that he found in Egypt a ritual that was 'in almost all points the same'.</div><div class="sentence"> (1) This was the well-known ritual of Osiris, in which the god was torn in pieces, lamented, searched for, discovered or recognized, and the mourning by a sudden Reversal turned into joy.</div><div class="sentence"> In any tragedy which still retained the stamp of its Dionysiac origin, this Discovery and Peripety might normally be expected to occur, and to occur together.</div><div class="sentence"> I have tried to show elsewhere how many of our extant tragedies do, as a matter of fact, show the marks of this ritual.</div><div class="sentence"> (2)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span> <div class="sentence">  (1) Cf.</div><div class="sentence"> Hdt.</div><div class="sentence"> ii.</div><div class="sentence"> 48; cf.</div><div class="sentence"> 42,144.</div><div class="sentence"> The name of Dionysus must not be openly mentioned in connexion with mourning (ib.</div><div class="sentence"> 61, 132, 86).</div><div class="sentence"> This may help to explain the transference of the tragic shows to other heroes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span> <div class="sentence">  (2) In Miss Harrison's Themis, pp.</div><div class="sentence"> 341-63.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span> <div class="sentence">  I hope it is not rash to surmise that the much-debated word __katharsis__, 'purification' or 'purgation', may have come into Aristotle's mouth from the same source.</div><div class="sentence"> It has all the appearance of being an old word which is accepted and re-interpreted by Aristotle rather than a word freely chosen by him to denote the exact phenomenon he wishes to describe.</div><div class="sentence"> At any rate the Dionysus ritual itself was a katharmos or katharsis—a purification of the community from the taints and poisons of the past year, the old contagion of sin and death.</div><div class="sentence"> And the words of Aristotle's definition of tragedy in Chapter VI might have been used in the days of Thespis in a much cruder and less metaphorical sense.</div><div class="sentence"> According to primitive ideas, the mimic representation on the stage of 'incidents arousing pity and fear' did act as a katharsis of such 'passions' or 'sufferings' in real life.</div><div class="sentence"> (For the word pathemata means 'sufferings' as well as 'passions'.)</div><div class="sentence"> It is worth remembering that in the year 361 B.C., during Aristotle's lifetime, Greek tragedies were introduced into Rome, not on artistic but on superstitious grounds, as a katharmos against a pestilence (Livy vii.</div><div class="sentence"> 2).</div><div class="sentence"> One cannot but suspect that in his account of the purpose of tragedy Aristotle may be using an old traditional formula, and consciously or unconsciously investing it with a new meaning, much as he has done with the word mythos.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span> <div class="sentence">  Apart from these historical causes of misunderstanding, a good teacher who uses this book with a class will hardly fail to point out numerous points on which two equally good Greek scholars may well differ in the mere interpretation of the words.</div><div class="sentence"> What, for instance, are the 'two natural causes' in Chapter IV which have given birth to Poetry?</div><div class="sentence"> Are they, as our translator takes them, (1) that man is imitative, and (2) that people delight in imitations?</div><div class="sentence"> Or are they (1) that man is imitative and people delight in imitations, and (2) the instinct for rhythm, as Professor Butcher prefers?</div><div class="sentence"> Is it a 'creature' a thousand miles long, or a 'picture' a thousand miles long which raises some trouble in Chapter VII?</div><div class="sentence"> The word zoon means equally 'picture' and 'animal'.</div><div class="sentence"> Did the older poets make their characters speak like 'statesmen', politikoi, or merely like ordinary citizens, politai, while the moderns made theirs like 'professors of rhetoric'?</div><div class="sentence"> (Chapter VI, p. 38; cf.</div><div class="sentence"> Margoliouth's note and glossary).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span> <div class="sentence">  It may seem as if the large uncertainties which we have indicated detract in a ruinous manner from the value of the Poetics to us as a work of criticism.</div><div class="sentence"> Certainly if any young writer took this book as a manual of rules by which to 'commence poet', he would find himself embarrassed.</div><div class="sentence"> But, if the book is properly read, not as a dogmatic text-book but as a first attempt, made by a man of astounding genius, to build up in the region of creative art a rational order like that which he established in logic, rhetoric, ethics, politics, physics, psychology, and almost every department of knowledge that existed in his day, then the uncertainties become rather a help than a discouragement.</div><div class="sentence"> They give us occasion to think and use our imagination.</div><div class="sentence"> They make us, to the best of our powers, try really to follow and criticize closely the bold gropings of an extraordinary thinker; and it is in this process, and not in any mere collection of dogmatic results, that we shall find the true value and beauty of the Poetics.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span> <div class="sentence">  The book is of permanent value as a mere intellectual achievement; as a store of information about Greek literature; and as an original or first-hand statement of what we may call the classical view of artistic criticism.</div><div class="sentence"> It does not regard poetry as a matter of unanalysed inspiration; it makes no concession to personal whims or fashion or ennui.</div><div class="sentence"> It tries by rational methods to find out what is good in art and what makes it good, accepting the belief that there is just as truly a good way, and many bad ways, in poetry as in morals or in playing billiards.</div><div class="sentence"> This is no place to try to sum up its main conclusions.</div><div class="sentence"> But it is characteristic of the classical view that Aristotle lays his greatest stress, first, on the need for Unity in the work of art, the need that each part should subserve the whole, while irrelevancies, however brilliant in themselves, should be cast away; and next, on the demand that great art must have for its subject the great way of living.</div><div class="sentence"> These judgements have often been misunderstood, but the truth in them is profound and goes near to the heart of things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span> <div class="sentence">  Characteristic, too, is the observation that different kinds of art grow and develop, but not indefinitely; they develop until they 'attain their natural form'; also the rule that each form of art should produce 'not every sort of pleasure but its proper pleasure'; and the sober language in which Aristotle, instead of speaking about the sequence of events in a tragedy being 'inevitable', as we bombastic moderns do, merely recommends that they should be 'either necessary or probable' and 'appear to happen because of one another'.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span> <div class="sentence">  Conceptions and attitudes of mind such as these constitute what we may call the classical faith in matters of art and poetry; a faith which is never perhaps fully accepted in any age, yet, unlike others, is never forgotten but lives by being constantly criticized, re-asserted, and rebelled against.</div><div class="sentence"> For the fashions of the ages vary in this direction and that, but they vary for the most part from a central road which was struck out by the imagination of Greece.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Epic poetry and Tragedy, as also Comedy, Dithyrambic poetry, and most flute-playing and lyre-playing, are all, viewed as a whole, modes of imitation.</div><div class="sentence"> But at the same time they differ from one another in three ways, either by a difference of kind in their means, or by differences in the objects, or in the manner of their imitations.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  I.</div><div class="sentence"> Just as form and colour are used as means by some, who (whether by art or constant practice) imitate and portray many things by their aid, and the voice is used by others; so also in the above-mentioned group of arts, the means with them as a whole are rhythm, language, and harmony—used, however, either singly or in certain combinations.</div><div class="sentence"> A combination of rhythm and harmony alone is the means in flute-playing and lyre-playing, and any other arts there may be of the same description, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> imitative piping.</div><div class="sentence"> Rhythm alone, without harmony, is the means in the dancer's imitations; for even he, by the rhythms of his attitudes, may represent men's characters, as well as what they do and suffer.</div><div class="sentence"> There is further an art which imitates by language alone, without harmony, in prose or in verse, and if in verse, either in some one or in a plurality of metres.</div><div class="sentence"> This form of imitation is to this day without a name.</div><div class="sentence"> We have no common name for a mime of Sophron or Xenarchus and a Socratic Conversation; and we should still be without one even if the imitation in the two instances were in trimeters or elegiacs or some other kind of verse—though it is the way with people to tack on 'poet' to the name of a metre, and talk of elegiac-poets and epic-poets, thinking that they call them poets not by reason of the imitative nature of their work, but indiscriminately by reason of the metre they write in.</div><div class="sentence"> Even if a theory of medicine or physical philosophy be put forth in a metrical form, it is usual to describe the writer in this way; Homer and Empedocles, however, have really nothing in common apart from their metre; so that, if the one is to be called a poet, the other should be termed a physicist rather than a poet.</div><div class="sentence"> We should be in the same position also, if the imitation in these instances were in all the metres, like the Centaur (a rhapsody in a medley of all metres) of Chaeremon; and Chaeremon one has to recognize as a poet.</div><div class="sentence"> So much, then, as to these arts.</div><div class="sentence"> There are, lastly, certain other arts, which combine all the means enumerated, rhythm, melody, and verse, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> Dithyrambic and Nomic poetry, Tragedy and Comedy; with this difference, however, that the three kinds of means are in some of them all employed together, and in others brought in separately, one after the other.</div><div class="sentence"> These elements of difference in the above arts I term the means of their imitation.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  II.</div><div class="sentence"> The objects the imitator represents are actions, with agents who are necessarily either good men or bad—the diversities of human character being nearly always derivative from this primary distinction, since the line between virtue and vice is one dividing the whole of mankind.</div><div class="sentence"> It follows, therefore, that the agents represented must be either above our own level of goodness, or beneath it, or just such as we are in the same way as, with the painters, the personages of Polygnotus are better than we are, those of Pauson worse, and those of Dionysius just like ourselves.</div><div class="sentence"> It is clear that each of the above-mentioned arts will admit of these differences, and that it will become a separate art by representing objects with this point of difference.</div><div class="sentence"> Even in dancing, flute-playing, and lyre-playing such diversities are possible; and they are also possible in the nameless art that uses language, prose or verse without harmony, as its means; Homer's personages, for instance, are better than we are; Cleophon's are on our own level; and those of Hegemon of Thasos, the first writer of parodies, and Nicochares, the author of the Diliad, are beneath it.</div><div class="sentence"> The same is true of the Dithyramb and the Nome: the personages may be presented in them with the difference exemplified in the... of... and Argas, and in the Cyclopses of Timotheus and Philoxenus.</div><div class="sentence"> This difference it is that distinguishes Tragedy and Comedy also; the one would make its personages worse, and the other better, than the men of the present day.</div></div>

</div><div id="link2H_4_0005" class="book_section">
<h2>3</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  III.</div><div class="sentence"> A third difference in these arts is in the manner in which each kind of object is represented.</div><div class="sentence"> Given both the same means and the same kind of object for imitation, one may either (1) speak at one moment in narrative and at another in an assumed character, as Homer does; or (2) one may remain the same throughout, without any such change; or (3) the imitators may represent the whole story dramatically, as though they were actually doing the things described.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  As we said at the beginning, therefore, the differences in the imitation of these arts come under three heads, their means, their objects, and their manner.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  So that as an imitator Sophocles will be on one side akin to Homer, both portraying good men; and on another to Aristophanes, since both present their personages as acting and doing.</div><div class="sentence"> This in fact, according to some, is the reason for plays being termed dramas, because in a play the personages act the story.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence too both Tragedy and Comedy are claimed by the Dorians as their discoveries; Comedy by the Megarians—by those in Greece as having arisen when Megara became a democracy, and by the Sicilian Megarians on the ground that the poet Epicharmus was of their country, and a good deal earlier than Chionides and Magnes; even Tragedy also is claimed by certain of the Peloponnesian Dorians.</div><div class="sentence"> In support of this claim they point to the words 'comedy' and 'drama'.</div><div class="sentence"> Their word for the outlying hamlets, they say, is comae, whereas Athenians call them demes—thus assuming that comedians got the name not from their comoe or revels, but from their strolling from hamlet to hamlet, lack of appreciation keeping them out of the city.</div><div class="sentence"> Their word also for 'to act', they say, is dran, whereas Athenians use prattein.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  So much, then, as to the number and nature of the points of difference in the imitation of these arts.</div></div>

</div><div id="link2H_4_0006" class="book_section">
<h2>4</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  It is clear that the general origin of poetry was due to two causes, each of them part of human nature.</div><div class="sentence"> Imitation is natural to man from childhood, one of his advantages over the lower animals being this, that he is the most imitative creature in the world, and learns at first by imitation.</div><div class="sentence"> And it is also natural for all to delight in works of imitation.</div><div class="sentence"> The truth of this second point is shown by experience: though the objects themselves may be painful to see, we delight to view the most realistic representations of them in art, the forms for example of the lowest animals and of dead bodies.</div><div class="sentence"> The explanation is to be found in a further fact: to be learning something is the greatest of pleasures not only to the philosopher but also to the rest of mankind, however small their capacity for it; the reason of the delight in seeing the picture is that one is at the same time learning—gathering the meaning of things, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> that the man there is so-and-so; for if one has not seen the thing before, one's pleasure will not be in the picture as an imitation of it, but will be due to the execution or colouring or some similar cause.</div><div class="sentence"> Imitation, then, being natural to us—as also the sense of harmony and rhythm, the metres being obviously species of rhythms—it was through their original aptitude, and by a series of improvements for the most part gradual on their first efforts, that they created poetry out of their improvisations.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Poetry, however, soon broke up into two kinds according to the differences of character in the individual poets; for the graver among them would represent noble actions, and those of noble personages; and the meaner sort the actions of the ignoble.</div><div class="sentence"> The latter class produced invectives at first, just as others did hymns and panegyrics.</div><div class="sentence"> We know of no such poem by any of the pre-Homeric poets, though there were probably many such writers among them; instances, however, may be found from Homer downwards, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> his Margites, and the similar poems of others.</div><div class="sentence"> In this poetry of invective its natural fitness brought an iambic metre into use; hence our present term 'iambic', because it was the metre of their 'iambs' or invectives against one another.</div><div class="sentence"> The result was that the old poets became some of them writers of heroic and others of iambic verse.</div><div class="sentence"> Homer's position, however, is peculiar: just as he was in the serious style the poet of poets, standing alone not only through the literary excellence, but also through the dramatic character of his imitations, so too he was the first to outline for us the general forms of Comedy by producing not a dramatic invective, but a dramatic picture of the Ridiculous; his Margites in fact stands in the same relation to our comedies as the Iliad and Odyssey to our tragedies.</div><div class="sentence"> As soon, however, as Tragedy and Comedy appeared in the field, those naturally drawn to the one line of poetry became writers of comedies instead of iambs, and those naturally drawn to the other, writers of tragedies instead of epics, because these new modes of art were grander and of more esteem than the old.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  If it be asked whether Tragedy is now all that it need be in its formative elements, to consider that, and decide it theoretically and in relation to the theatres, is a matter for another inquiry.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  It certainly began in improvisations—as did also Comedy; the one originating with the authors of the Dithyramb, the other with those of the phallic songs, which still survive as institutions in many of our cities.</div><div class="sentence"> And its advance after that was little by little, through their improving on whatever they had before them at each stage.</div><div class="sentence"> It was in fact only after a long series of changes that the movement of Tragedy stopped on its attaining to its natural form.</div><div class="sentence"> (1) The number of actors was first increased to two by Aeschylus, who curtailed the business of the Chorus, and made the dialogue, or spoken portion, take the leading part in the play.</div><div class="sentence"> (2) A third actor and scenery were due to Sophocles.</div><div class="sentence"> (3) Tragedy acquired also its magnitude.</div><div class="sentence"> Discarding short stories and a ludicrous diction, through its passing out of its satyric stage, it assumed, though only at a late point in its progress, a tone of dignity; and its metre changed then from trochaic to iambic.</div><div class="sentence"> The reason for their original use of the trochaic tetrameter was that their poetry was satyric and more connected with dancing than it now is.</div><div class="sentence"> As soon, however, as a spoken part came in, nature herself found the appropriate metre.</div><div class="sentence"> The iambic, we know, is the most speakable of metres, as is shown by the fact that we very often fall into it in conversation, whereas we rarely talk hexameters, and only when we depart from the speaking tone of voice.</div><div class="sentence"> (4) Another change was a plurality of episodes or acts.</div><div class="sentence"> As for the remaining matters, the superadded embellishments and the account of their introduction, these must be taken as said, as it would probably be a long piece of work to go through the details.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  As for Comedy, it is (as has been observed) an imitation of men worse than the average; worse, however, not as regards any and every sort of fault, but only as regards one particular kind, the Ridiculous, which is a species of the Ugly.</div><div class="sentence"> The Ridiculous may be defined as a mistake or deformity not productive of pain or harm to others; the mask, for instance, that excites laughter, is something ugly and distorted without causing pain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Though the successive changes in Tragedy and their authors are not unknown, we cannot say the same of Comedy; its early stages passed unnoticed, because it was not as yet taken up in a serious way.</div><div class="sentence"> It was only at a late point in its progress that a chorus of comedians was officially granted by the archon; they used to be mere volunteers.</div><div class="sentence"> It had also already certain definite forms at the time when the record of those termed comic poets begins.</div><div class="sentence"> Who it was who supplied it with masks, or prologues, or a plurality of actors and the like, has remained unknown.</div><div class="sentence"> The invented Fable, or Plot, however, originated in Sicily, with Epicharmus and Phormis; of Athenian poets Crates was the first to drop the Comedy of invective and frame stories of a general and non-personal nature, in other words, Fables or Plots.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Epic poetry, then, has been seen to agree with Tragedy to this extent, that of being an imitation of serious subjects in a grand kind of verse.</div><div class="sentence"> It differs from it, however, (1) in that it is in one kind of verse and in narrative form; and (2) in its length—which is due to its action having no fixed limit of time, whereas Tragedy endeavours to keep as far as possible within a single circuit of the sun, or something near that.</div><div class="sentence"> This, I say, is another point of difference between them, though at first the practice in this respect was just the same in tragedies as in epic poems.</div><div class="sentence"> They differ also (3) in their constituents, some being common to both and others peculiar to Tragedy—hence a judge of good and bad in Tragedy is a judge of that in epic poetry also.</div><div class="sentence"> All the parts of an epic are included in Tragedy; but those of Tragedy are not all of them to be found in the Epic.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  Reserving hexameter poetry and Comedy for consideration hereafter, let us proceed now to the discussion of Tragedy; before doing so, however, we must gather up the definition resulting from what has been said.</div><div class="sentence"> A tragedy, then, is the imitation of an action that is serious and also, as having magnitude, complete in itself; in language with pleasurable accessories, each kind brought in separately in the parts of the work; in a dramatic, not in a narrative form; with incidents arousing pity and fear, wherewith to accomplish its catharsis of such emotions.</div><div class="sentence"> Here by 'language with pleasurable accessories' I mean that with rhythm and harmony or song superadded; and by 'the kinds separately' I mean that some portions are worked out with verse only, and others in turn with song.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  I.</div><div class="sentence"> As they act the stories, it follows that in the first place the Spectacle (or stage-appearance of the actors) must be some part of the whole; and in the second Melody and Diction, these two being the means of their imitation.</div><div class="sentence"> Here by 'Diction' I mean merely this, the composition of the verses; and by 'Melody', what is too completely understood to require explanation.</div><div class="sentence"> But further: the subject represented also is an action; and the action involves agents, who must necessarily have their distinctive qualities both of character and thought, since it is from these that we ascribe certain qualities to their actions.</div><div class="sentence"> There are in the natural order of things, therefore, two causes, Character and Thought, of their actions, and consequently of their success or failure in their lives.</div><div class="sentence"> Now the action (that which was done) is represented in the play by the Fable or Plot.</div><div class="sentence"> The Fable, in our present sense of the term, is simply this, the combination of the incidents, or things done in the story; whereas Character is what makes us ascribe certain moral qualities to the agents; and Thought is shown in all they say when proving a particular point or, it may be, enunciating a general truth.</div><div class="sentence"> There are six parts consequently of every tragedy, as a whole, that is, of such or such quality, viz.</div><div class="sentence"> a Fable or Plot, Characters, Diction, Thought, Spectacle and Melody; two of them arising from the means, one from the manner, and three from the objects of the dramatic imitation; and there is nothing else besides these six.</div><div class="sentence"> Of these, its formative elements, then, not a few of the dramatists have made due use, as every play, one may say, admits of Spectacle, Character, Fable, Diction, Melody, and Thought.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  II.</div><div class="sentence"> The most important of the six is the combination of the incidents of the story.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  Tragedy is essentially an imitation not of persons but of action and life, of happiness and misery.</div><div class="sentence"> All human happiness or misery takes the form of action; the end for which we live is a certain kind of activity, not a quality.</div><div class="sentence"> Character gives us qualities, but it is in our actions—what we do—that we are happy or the reverse.</div><div class="sentence"> In a play accordingly they do not act in order to portray the Characters; they include the Characters for the sake of the action.</div><div class="sentence"> So that it is the action in it, i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> its Fable or Plot, that is the end and purpose of the tragedy; and the end is everywhere the chief thing.</div><div class="sentence"> Besides this, a tragedy is impossible without action, but there may be one without Character.</div><div class="sentence"> The tragedies of most of the moderns are characterless—a defect common among poets of all kinds, and with its counterpart in painting in Zeuxis as compared with Polygnotus; for whereas the latter is strong in character, the work of Zeuxis is devoid of it.</div><div class="sentence"> And again: one may string together a series of characteristic speeches of the utmost finish as regards Diction and Thought, and yet fail to produce the true tragic effect; but one will have much better success with a tragedy which, however inferior in these respects, has a Plot, a combination of incidents, in it.</div><div class="sentence"> And again: the most powerful elements of attraction in Tragedy, the Peripeties and Discoveries, are parts of the Plot.</div><div class="sentence"> A further proof is in the fact that beginners succeed earlier with the Diction and Characters than with the construction of a story; and the same may be said of nearly all the early dramatists.</div><div class="sentence"> We maintain, therefore, that the first essential, the life and soul, so to speak, of Tragedy is the Plot; and that the Characters come second—compare the parallel in painting, where the most beautiful colours laid on without order will not give one the same pleasure as a simple black-and-white sketch of a portrait.</div><div class="sentence"> We maintain that Tragedy is primarily an imitation of action, and that it is mainly for the sake of the action that it imitates the personal agents.</div><div class="sentence"> Third comes the element of Thought, i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> the power of saying whatever can be said, or what is appropriate to the occasion.</div><div class="sentence"> This is what, in the speeches in Tragedy, falls under the arts of Politics and Rhetoric; for the older poets make their personages discourse like statesmen, and the moderns like rhetoricians.</div><div class="sentence"> One must not confuse it with Character.</div><div class="sentence"> Character in a play is that which reveals the moral purpose of the agents, i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> the sort of thing they seek or avoid, where that is not obvious—hence there is no room for Character in a speech on a purely indifferent subject.</div><div class="sentence"> Thought, on the other hand, is shown in all they say when proving or disproving some particular point, or enunciating some universal proposition.</div><div class="sentence"> Fourth among the literary elements is the Diction of the personages, i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> as before explained, the expression of their thoughts in words, which is practically the same thing with verse as with prose.</div><div class="sentence"> As for the two remaining parts, the Melody is the greatest of the pleasurable accessories of Tragedy.</div><div class="sentence"> The Spectacle, though an attraction, is the least artistic of all the parts, and has least to do with the art of poetry.</div><div class="sentence"> The tragic effect is quite possible without a public performance and actors; and besides, the getting-up of the Spectacle is more a matter for the costumier than the poet.</div></div>

<h2>7</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  Having thus distinguished the parts, let us now consider the proper construction of the Fable or Plot, as that is at once the first and the most important thing in Tragedy.</div><div class="sentence"> We have laid it down that a tragedy is an imitation of an action that is complete in itself, as a whole of some magnitude; for a whole may be of no magnitude to speak of.</div><div class="sentence"> Now a whole is that which has beginning, middle, and end.</div><div class="sentence"> A beginning is that which is not itself necessarily after anything else, and which has naturally something else after it; an end is that which is naturally after something itself, either as its necessary or usual consequent, and with nothing else after it; and a middle, that which is by nature after one thing and has also another after it.</div><div class="sentence"> A well-constructed Plot, therefore, cannot either begin or end at any point one likes; beginning and end in it must be of the forms just described.</div><div class="sentence"> Again: to be beautiful, a living creature, and every whole made up of parts, must not only present a certain order in its arrangement of parts, but also be of a certain definite magnitude.</div><div class="sentence"> Beauty is a matter of size and order, and therefore impossible either (1) in a very minute creature, since our perception becomes indistinct as it approaches instantaneity; or (2) in a creature of vast size—one, say, 1,000 miles long—as in that case, instead of the object being seen all at once, the unity and wholeness of it is lost to the beholder.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Just in the same way, then, as a beautiful whole made up of parts, or a beautiful living creature, must be of some size, a size to be taken in by the eye, so a story or Plot must be of some length, but of a length to be taken in by the memory.</div><div class="sentence"> As for the limit of its length, so far as that is relative to public performances and spectators, it does not fall within the theory of poetry.</div><div class="sentence"> If they had to perform a hundred tragedies, they would be timed by water-clocks, as they are said to have been at one period.</div><div class="sentence"> The limit, however, set by the actual nature of the thing is this: the longer the story, consistently with its being comprehensible as a whole, the finer it is by reason of its magnitude.</div><div class="sentence"> As a rough general formula, 'a length which allows of the hero passing by a series of probable or necessary stages from misfortune to happiness, or from happiness to misfortune', may suffice as a limit for the magnitude of the story.</div></div>

</div><div id="link2H_4_0010" class="book_section">
<h2>8</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  The Unity of a Plot does not consist, as some suppose, in its having one man as its subject.</div><div class="sentence"> An infinity of things befall that one man, some of which it is impossible to reduce to unity; and in like manner there are many actions of one man which cannot be made to form one action.</div><div class="sentence"> One sees, therefore, the mistake of all the poets who have written a Heracleid, a Theseid, or similar poems; they suppose that, because Heracles was one man, the story also of Heracles must be one story.</div><div class="sentence"> Homer, however, evidently understood this point quite well, whether by art or instinct, just in the same way as he excels the rest in every other respect.</div><div class="sentence"> In writing an Odyssey, he did not make the poem cover all that ever befell his hero—it befell him, for instance, to get wounded on Parnassus and also to feign madness at the time of the call to arms, but the two incidents had no probable or necessary connexion with one another—instead of doing that, he took an action with a Unity of the kind we are describing as the subject of the Odyssey, as also of the Iliad.</div><div class="sentence"> The truth is that, just as in the other imitative arts one imitation is always of one thing, so in poetry the story, as an imitation of action, must represent one action, a complete whole, with its several incidents so closely connected that the transposal or withdrawal of any one of them will disjoin and dislocate the whole.</div><div class="sentence"> For that which makes no perceptible difference by its presence or absence is no real part of the whole.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  From what we have said it will be seen that the poet's function is to describe, not the thing that has happened, but a kind of thing that might happen, i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> what is possible as being probable or necessary.</div><div class="sentence"> The distinction between historian and poet is not in the one writing prose and the other verse—you might put the work of Herodotus into verse, and it would still be a species of history; it consists really in this, that the one describes the thing that has been, and the other a kind of thing that might be.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence poetry is something more philosophic and of graver import than history, since its statements are of the nature rather of universals, whereas those of history are singulars.</div><div class="sentence"> By a universal statement I mean one as to what such or such a kind of man will probably or necessarily say or do—which is the aim of poetry, though it affixes proper names to the characters; by a singular statement, one as to what, say, Alcibiades did or had done to him.</div><div class="sentence"> In Comedy this has become clear by this time; it is only when their plot is already made up of probable incidents that they give it a basis of proper names, choosing for the purpose any names that may occur to them, instead of writing like the old iambic poets about particular persons.</div><div class="sentence"> In Tragedy, however, they still adhere to the historic names; and for this reason: what convinces is the possible; now whereas we are not yet sure as to the possibility of that which has not happened, that which has happened is manifestly possible, else it would not have come to pass.</div><div class="sentence"> Nevertheless even in Tragedy there are some plays with but one or two known names in them, the rest being inventions; and there are some without a single known name, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> Agathon's Anthens, in which both incidents and names are of the poet's invention; and it is no less delightful on that account.</div><div class="sentence"> So that one must not aim at a rigid adherence to the traditional stories on which tragedies are based.</div><div class="sentence"> It would be absurd, in fact, to do so, as even the known stories are only known to a few, though they are a delight none the less to all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  It is evident from the above that, the poet must be more the poet of his stories or Plots than of his verses, inasmuch as he is a poet by virtue of the imitative element in his work, and it is actions that he imitates.</div><div class="sentence"> And if he should come to take a subject from actual history, he is none the less a poet for that; since some historic occurrences may very well be in the probable and possible order of things; and it is in that aspect of them that he is their poet.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Of simple Plots and actions the episodic are the worst.</div><div class="sentence"> I call a Plot episodic when there is neither probability nor necessity in the sequence of episodes.</div><div class="sentence"> Actions of this sort bad poets construct through their own fault, and good ones on account of the players.</div><div class="sentence"> His work being for public performance, a good poet often stretches out a Plot beyond its capabilities, and is thus obliged to twist the sequence of incident.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  Tragedy, however, is an imitation not only of a complete action, but also of incidents arousing pity and fear.</div><div class="sentence"> Such incidents have the very greatest effect on the mind when they occur unexpectedly and at the same time in consequence of one another; there is more of the marvellous in them then than if they happened of themselves or by mere chance.</div><div class="sentence"> Even matters of chance seem most marvellous if there is an appearance of design as it were in them; as for instance the statue of Mitys at Argos killed the author of Mitys' death by falling down on him when a looker-on at a public spectacle; for incidents like that we think to be not without a meaning.</div><div class="sentence"> A Plot, therefore, of this sort is necessarily finer than others.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  We assume that, for the finest form of Tragedy, the Plot must be not simple but complex; and further, that it must imitate actions arousing pity and fear, since that is the distinctive function of this kind of imitation.</div><div class="sentence"> It follows, therefore, that there are three forms of Plot to be avoided.</div><div class="sentence"> (1) A good man must not be seen passing from happiness to misery, or (2) a bad man from misery to happiness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  The first situation is not fear-inspiring or piteous, but simply odious to us.</div><div class="sentence"> The second is the most untragic that can be; it has no one of the requisites of Tragedy; it does not appeal either to the human feeling in us, or to our pity, or to our fears.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor, on the other hand, should (3) an extremely bad man be seen falling from happiness into misery.</div><div class="sentence"> Such a story may arouse the human feeling in us, but it will not move us to either pity or fear; pity is occasioned by undeserved misfortune, and fear by that of one like ourselves; so that there will be nothing either piteous or fear-inspiring in the situation.</div><div class="sentence"> There remains, then, the intermediate kind of personage, a man not pre-eminently virtuous and just, whose misfortune, however, is brought upon him not by vice and depravity but by some error of judgement, of the number of those in the enjoyment of great reputation and prosperity; e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> Oedipus, Thyestes, and the men of note of similar families.</div><div class="sentence"> The perfect Plot, accordingly, must have a single, and not (as some tell us) a double issue; the change in the hero's fortunes must be not from misery to happiness, but on the contrary from happiness to misery; and the cause of it must lie not in any depravity, but in some great error on his part; the man himself being either such as we have described, or better, not worse, than that.</div><div class="sentence"> Fact also confirms our theory.</div><div class="sentence"> Though the poets began by accepting any tragic story that came to hand, in these days the finest tragedies are always on the story of some few houses, on that of Alemeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, or any others that may have been involved, as either agents or sufferers, in some deed of horror.</div><div class="sentence"> The theoretically best tragedy, then, has a Plot of this description.</div><div class="sentence"> The critics, therefore, are wrong who blame Euripides for taking this line in his tragedies, and giving many of them an unhappy ending.</div><div class="sentence"> It is, as we have said, the right line to take.</div><div class="sentence"> The best proof is this: on the stage, and in the public performances, such plays, properly worked out, are seen to be the most truly tragic; and Euripides, even if his elecution be faulty in every other point, is seen to be nevertheless the most tragic certainly of the dramatists.</div><div class="sentence"> After this comes the construction of Plot which some rank first, one with a double story (like the Odyssey) and an opposite issue for the good and the bad personages.</div><div class="sentence"> It is ranked as first only through the weakness of the audiences; the poets merely follow their public, writing as its wishes dictate.</div><div class="sentence"> But the pleasure here is not that of Tragedy.</div><div class="sentence"> It belongs rather to Comedy, where the bitterest enemies in the piece (e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> Orestes and Aegisthus) walk off good friends at the end, with no slaying of any one by any one.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  The tragic fear and pity may be aroused by the Spectacle; but they may also be aroused by the very structure and incidents of the play—which is the better way and shows the better poet.</div><div class="sentence"> The Plot in fact should be so framed that, even without seeing the things take place, he who simply hears the account of them shall be filled with horror and pity at the incidents; which is just the effect that the mere recital of the story in Oedipus would have on one.</div><div class="sentence"> To produce this same effect by means of the Spectacle is less artistic, and requires extraneous aid.</div><div class="sentence"> Those, however, who make use of the Spectacle to put before us that which is merely monstrous and not productive of fear, are wholly out of touch with Tragedy; not every kind of pleasure should be required of a tragedy, but only its own proper pleasure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  The tragic pleasure is that of pity and fear, and the poet has to produce it by a work of imitation; it is clear, therefore, that the causes should be included in the incidents of his story.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us see, then, what kinds of incident strike one as horrible, or rather as piteous.</div><div class="sentence"> In a deed of this description the parties must necessarily be either friends, or enemies, or indifferent to one another.</div><div class="sentence"> Now when enemy does it on enemy, there is nothing to move us to pity either in his doing or in his meditating the deed, except so far as the actual pain of the sufferer is concerned; and the same is true when the parties are indifferent to one another.</div><div class="sentence"> Whenever the tragic deed, however, is done within the family—when murder or the like is done or meditated by brother on brother, by son on father, by mother on son, or son on mother—these are the situations the poet should seek after.</div><div class="sentence"> The traditional stories, accordingly, must be kept as they are, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> the murder of Clytaemnestra by Orestes and of Eriphyle by Alcmeon.</div><div class="sentence"> At the same time even with these there is something left to the poet himself; it is for him to devise the right way of treating them.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us explain more clearly what we mean by 'the right way'.</div><div class="sentence"> The deed of horror may be done by the doer knowingly and consciously, as in the old poets, and in Medea's murder of her children in Euripides.</div><div class="sentence"> Or he may do it, but in ignorance of his relationship, and discover that afterwards, as does the Oedipus in Sophocles.</div><div class="sentence"> Here the deed is outside the play; but it may be within it, like the act of the Alcmeon in Astydamas, or that of the Telegonus in Ulysses Wounded.</div><div class="sentence"> A third possibility is for one meditating some deadly injury to another, in ignorance of his relationship, to make the discovery in time to draw back.</div><div class="sentence"> These exhaust the possibilities, since the deed must necessarily be either done or not done, and either knowingly or unknowingly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  The worst situation is when the personage is with full knowledge on the point of doing the deed, and leaves it undone.</div><div class="sentence"> It is odious and also (through the absence of suffering) untragic; hence it is that no one is made to act thus except in some few instances, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> Haemon and Creon in Antigone.</div><div class="sentence"> Next after this comes the actual perpetration of the deed meditated.</div><div class="sentence"> A better situation than that, however, is for the deed to be done in ignorance, and the relationship discovered afterwards, since there is nothing odious in it, and the Discovery will serve to astound us.</div><div class="sentence"> But the best of all is the last; what we have in Cresphontes, for example, where Merope, on the point of slaying her son, recognizes him in time; in Iphigenia, where sister and brother are in a like position; and in Helle, where the son recognizes his mother, when on the point of giving her up to her enemy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  This will explain why our tragedies are restricted (as we said just now) to such a small number of families.</div><div class="sentence"> It was accident rather than art that led the poets in quest of subjects to embody this kind of incident in their Plots.</div><div class="sentence"> They are still obliged, accordingly, to have recourse to the families in which such horrors have occurred.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  All these rules one must keep in mind throughout, and further, those also for such points of stage-effect as directly depend on the art of the poet, since in these too one may often make mistakes.</div><div class="sentence"> Enough, however, has been said on the subject in one of our published writings.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  There is, however, a difference in the Epic as compared with Tragedy, (1) in its length, and (2) in its metre.</div><div class="sentence"> (1) As to its length, the limit already suggested will suffice: it must be possible for the beginning and end of the work to be taken in in one view—a condition which will be fulfilled if the poem be shorter than the old epics, and about as long as the series of tragedies offered for one hearing.</div><div class="sentence"> For the extension of its length epic poetry has a special advantage, of which it makes large use.</div><div class="sentence"> In a play one cannot represent an action with a number of parts going on simultaneously; one is limited to the part on the stage and connected with the actors.</div><div class="sentence"> Whereas in epic poetry the narrative form makes it possible for one to describe a number of simultaneous incidents; and these, if germane to the subject, increase the body of the poem.</div><div class="sentence"> This then is a gain to the Epic, tending to give it grandeur, and also variety of interest and room for episodes of diverse kinds.</div><div class="sentence"> Uniformity of incident by the satiety it soon creates is apt to ruin tragedies on the stage.</div><div class="sentence"> (2) As for its metre, the heroic has been assigned it from experience; were any one to attempt a narrative poem in some one, or in several, of the other metres, the incongruity of the thing would be apparent.</div><div class="sentence"> The heroic; in fact is the gravest and weightiest of metres—which is what makes it more tolerant than the rest of strange words and metaphors, that also being a point in which the narrative form of poetry goes beyond all others.</div><div class="sentence"> The iambic and trochaic, on the other hand, are metres of movement, the one representing that of life and action, the other that of the dance.</div><div class="sentence"> Still more unnatural would it appear, it one were to write an epic in a medley of metres, as Chaeremon did.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence it is that no one has ever written a long story in any but heroic verse; nature herself, as we have said, teaches us to select the metre appropriate to such a story.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Homer, admirable as he is in every other respect, is especially so in this, that he alone among epic poets is not unaware of the part to be played by the poet himself in the poem.</div><div class="sentence"> The poet should say very little in propria persona, as he is no imitator when doing that.</div><div class="sentence"> Whereas the other poets are perpetually coming forward in person, and say but little, and that only here and there, as imitators, Homer after a brief preface brings in forthwith a man, a woman, or some other Character—no one of them characterless, but each with distinctive characteristics.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  The marvellous is certainly required in Tragedy.</div><div class="sentence"> The Epic, however, affords more opening for the improbable, the chief factor in the marvellous, because in it the agents are not visibly before one.</div><div class="sentence"> The scene of the pursuit of Hector would be ridiculous on the stage—the Greeks halting instead of pursuing him, and Achilles shaking his head to stop them; but in the poem the absurdity is overlooked.</div><div class="sentence"> The marvellous, however, is a cause of pleasure, as is shown by the fact that we all tell a story with additions, in the belief that we are doing our hearers a pleasure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  Homer more than any other has taught the rest of us the art of framing lies in the right way.</div><div class="sentence"> I mean the use of paralogism.</div><div class="sentence"> Whenever, if A is or happens, a consequent, B, is or happens, men's notion is that, if the B is, the A also is—but that is a false conclusion.</div><div class="sentence"> Accordingly, if A is untrue, but there is something else, B, that on the assumption of its truth follows as its consequent, the right thing then is to add on the B.</div><div class="sentence"> Just because we know the truth of the consequent, we are in our own minds led on to the erroneous inference of the truth of the antecedent.</div><div class="sentence"> Here is an instance, from the Bath-story in the Odyssey.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  A likely impossibility is always preferable to an unconvincing possibility.</div><div class="sentence"> The story should never be made up of improbable incidents; there should be nothing of the sort in it.</div><div class="sentence"> If, however, such incidents are unavoidable, they should be outside the piece, like the hero's ignorance in Oedipus of the circumstances of Lams' death; not within it, like the report of the Pythian games in Electra, or the man's having come to Mysia from Tegea without uttering a word on the way, in The Mysians.</div><div class="sentence"> So that it is ridiculous to say that one's Plot would have been spoilt without them, since it is fundamentally wrong to make up such Plots.</div><div class="sentence"> If the poet has taken such a Plot, however, and one sees that he might have put it in a more probable form, he is guilty of absurdity as well as a fault of art.</div><div class="sentence"> Even in the Odyssey the improbabilities in the setting-ashore of Ulysses would be clearly intolerable in the hands of an inferior poet.</div><div class="sentence"> As it is, the poet conceals them, his other excellences veiling their absurdity.</div><div class="sentence"> Elaborate Diction, however, is required only in places where there is no action, and no Character or Thought to be revealed.</div><div class="sentence"> Where there is Character or Thought, on the other hand, an over-ornate Diction tends to obscure them.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  III.</div><div class="sentence"> Other criticisms one must meet by considering the language of the poet: (1) by the assumption of a strange word in a passage like oureas men proton, where by oureas Homer may perhaps mean not mules but sentinels.</div><div class="sentence"> And in saying of Dolon, hos p e toi eidos men heen kakos, his meaning may perhaps be, not that Dolon's body was deformed, but that his face was ugly, as eneidos is the Cretan word for handsome-faced.</div><div class="sentence"> So, too, goroteron de keraie may mean not 'mix the wine stronger', as though for topers, but 'mix it quicker'.</div><div class="sentence"> (2) Other expressions in Homer may be explained as metaphorical; e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> in halloi men ra theoi te kai aneres eudon (hapantes) pannux as compared with what he tells us at the same time, e toi hot hes pedion to Troikon hathreseien, aulon suriggon *te homadon* the word hapantes 'all', is metaphorically put for 'many', since 'all' is a species of 'many '.</div><div class="sentence"> So also his oie d' ammoros is metaphorical, the best known standing 'alone'.</div><div class="sentence"> (3) A change, as Hippias suggested, in the mode of reading a word will solve the difficulty in didomen de oi, and to men ou kataputhetai hombro.</div><div class="sentence"> (4) Other difficulties may be solved by another punctuation; e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> in Empedocles, aipsa de thnet ephyonto, ta prin mathon athanata xora te prin kekreto.</div><div class="sentence"> Or (5) by the assumption of an equivocal term, as in parocheken de pleo nux, where pleo in equivocal.</div><div class="sentence"> Or (6) by an appeal to the custom of language.</div><div class="sentence"> Wine-and-water we call 'wine'; and it is on the same principle that Homer speaks of a knemis neoteuktou kassiteroio, a 'greave of new-wrought tin.'</div><div class="sentence"> A worker in iron we call a 'brazier'; and it is on the same principle that Ganymede is described as the 'wine-server' of Zeus, though the Gods do not drink wine.</div><div class="sentence"> This latter, however, may be an instance of metaphor.</div><div class="sentence"> But whenever also a word seems to imply some contradiction, it is necessary to reflect how many ways there may be of understanding it in the passage in question; e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> in Homer's te r' hesxeto xalkeon hegxos one should consider the possible senses of 'was stopped there'—whether by taking it in this sense or in that one will best avoid the fault of which Glaucon speaks: 'They start with some improbable presumption; and having so decreed it themselves, proceed to draw inferences, and censure the poet as though he had actually said whatever they happen to believe, if his statement conflicts with their own notion of things.'</div><div class="sentence"> This is how Homer's silence about Icarius has been treated.</div><div class="sentence"> Starting with, the notion of his having been a Lacedaemonian, the critics think it strange for Telemachus not to have met him when he went to Lacedaemon.</div><div class="sentence"> Whereas the fact may have been as the Cephallenians say, that the wife of Ulysses was of a Cephallenian family, and that her father's name was Icadius, not Icarius.</div><div class="sentence"> So that it is probably a mistake of the critics that has given rise to the Problem.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  Speaking generally, one has to justify (1) the Impossible by reference to the requirements of poetry, or to the better, or to opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> For the purposes of poetry a convincing impossibility is preferable to an unconvincing possibility; and if men such as Zeuxis depicted be impossible, the answer is that it is better they should be like that, as the artist ought to improve on his model.</div><div class="sentence"> (2) The Improbable one has to justify either by showing it to be in accordance with opinion, or by urging that at times it is not improbable; for there is a probability of things happening also against probability.</div><div class="sentence"> (3) The contradictions found in the poet's language one should first test as one does an opponent's confutation in a dialectical argument, so as to see whether he means the same thing, in the same relation, and in the same sense, before admitting that he has contradicted either something he has said himself or what a man of sound sense assumes as true.</div><div class="sentence"> But there is no possible apology for improbability of Plot or depravity of character, when they are not necessary and no use is made of them, like the improbability in the appearance of Aegeus in Medea and the baseness of Menelaus in Orestes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  The objections, then, of critics start with faults of five kinds: the allegation is always that something in either (1) impossible, (2) improbable, (3) corrupting, (4) contradictory, or (5) against technical correctness.</div><div class="sentence"> The answers to these objections must be sought under one or other of the above-mentioned heads, which are twelve in number.</div></div>

<h2>26</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  The question may be raised whether the epic or the tragic is the higher form of imitation.</div><div class="sentence"> It may be argued that, if the less vulgar is the higher, and the less vulgar is always that which addresses the better public, an art addressing any and every one is of a very vulgar order.</div><div class="sentence"> It is a belief that their public cannot see the meaning, unless they add something themselves, that causes the perpetual movements of the performers—bad flute-players, for instance, rolling about, if quoit-throwing is to be represented, and pulling at the conductor, if Scylla is the subject of the piece.</div><div class="sentence"> Tragedy, then, is said to be an art of this order—to be in fact just what the later actors were in the eyes of their predecessors; for Myrmiscus used to call Callippides 'the ape', because he thought he so overacted his parts; and a similar view was taken of Pindarus also.</div><div class="sentence"> All Tragedy, however, is said to stand to the Epic as the newer to the older school of actors.</div><div class="sentence"> The one, accordingly, is said to address a cultivated 'audience, which does not need the accompaniment of gesture; the other, an uncultivated one.</div><div class="sentence"> If, therefore, Tragedy is a vulgar art, it must clearly be lower than the Epic.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  The answer to this is twofold.</div><div class="sentence"> In the first place, one may urge (1) that the censure does not touch the art of the dramatic poet, but only that of his interpreter; for it is quite possible to overdo the gesturing even in an epic recital, as did Sosistratus, and in a singing contest, as did Mnasitheus of Opus.</div><div class="sentence"> (2) That one should not condemn all movement, unless one means to condemn even the dance, but only that of ignoble people—which is the point of the criticism passed on Callippides and in the present day on others, that their women are not like gentlewomen.</div><div class="sentence"> (3) That Tragedy may produce its effect even without movement or action in just the same way as Epic poetry; for from the mere reading of a play its quality may be seen.</div><div class="sentence"> So that, if it be superior in all other respects, this element of inferiority is not a necessary part of it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  In the second place, one must remember (1) that Tragedy has everything that the Epic has (even the epic metre being admissible), together with a not inconsiderable addition in the shape of the Music (a very real factor in the pleasure of the drama) and the Spectacle.</div><div class="sentence"> (2) That its reality of presentation is felt in the play as read, as well as in the play as acted.</div><div class="sentence"> (3) That the tragic imitation requires less space for the attainment of its end; which is a great advantage, since the more concentrated effect is more pleasurable than one with a large admixture of time to dilute it—consider the Oedipus of Sophocles, for instance, and the effect of expanding it into the number of lines of the Iliad.</div><div class="sentence"> (4) That there is less unity in the imitation of the epic poets, as is proved by the fact that any one work of theirs supplies matter for several tragedies; the result being that, if they take what is really a single story, it seems curt when briefly told, and thin and waterish when on the scale of length usual with their verse.</div><div class="sentence"> In saying that there is less unity in an epic, I mean an epic made up of a plurality of actions, in the same way as the Iliad and Odyssey have many such parts, each one of them in itself of some magnitude; yet the structure of the two Homeric poems is as perfect as can be, and the action in them is as nearly as possible one action.</div><div class="sentence"> If, then, Tragedy is superior in these respects, and also besides these, in its poetic effect (since the two forms of poetry should give us, not any or every pleasure, but the very special kind we have mentioned), it is clear that, as attaining the poetic effect better than the Epic, it will be the higher form of art.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  So much for Tragedy and Epic poetry—for these two arts in general and their species; the number and nature of their constituent parts; the causes of success and failure in them; the Objections of the critics, and the Solutions in answer to them.</div></div>
