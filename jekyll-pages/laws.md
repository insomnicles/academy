<h2>INTRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  The genuineness of the Laws is sufficiently proved (1) by more than twenty citations of them in the writings of Aristotle, who was residing at Athens during the last twenty years of the life of Plato, and who, having left it after his death (B.C.</div><div class="sentence"> 347), returned thither twelve years later (B.C.</div><div class="sentence"> 335); (2) by the allusion of Isocrates</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  (Oratio ad Philippum missa, p.84: To men tais paneguresin enochlein kai pros apantas legein tous sunprechontas en autais pros oudena legein estin, all omoios oi toioutoi ton logon (sc.</div><div class="sentence"> speeches in the assembly) akuroi tugchanousin ontes tois nomois kai tais politeiais tais upo ton sophiston gegrammenais.)</div><div class="sentence"> —writing 346 B.C., a year after the death of Plato, and probably not more than three or four years after the composition of the Laws—who speaks of the Laws and Republics written by philosophers (upo ton sophiston); (3) by the reference (Athen.)</div><div class="sentence"> of the comic poet Alexis, a younger contemporary of Plato (fl.</div><div class="sentence"> B.C 356-306), to the enactment about prices, which occurs in Laws xi., viz that the same goods should not be offered at two prices on the same day</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Meineke, Frag.</div><div class="sentence"> Com.</div><div class="sentence"> Graec.</div><div class="sentence"> ); (4) by the unanimous voice of later antiquity and the absence of any suspicion among ancient writers worth speaking of to the contrary; for it is not said of Philippus of Opus that he composed any part of the Laws, but only that he copied them out of the waxen tablets, and was thought by some to have written the Epinomis (Diog.</div><div class="sentence"> Laert.)</div><div class="sentence"> That the longest and one of the best writings bearing the name of Plato should be a forgery, even if its genuineness were unsupported by external testimony, would be a singular phenomenon in ancient literature; and although the critical worth of the consensus of late writers is generally not to be compared with the express testimony of contemporaries, yet a somewhat greater value may be attributed to their consent in the present instance, because the admission of the Laws is combined with doubts about the Epinomis, a spurious writing, which is a kind of epilogue to the larger work probably of a much later date.</div><div class="sentence"> This shows that the reception of the Laws was not altogether undiscriminating.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  The suspicion which has attached to the Laws of Plato in the judgment of some modern writers appears to rest partly (1) on differences in the style and form of the work, and (2) on differences of thought and opinion which they observe in them.</div><div class="sentence"> Their suspicion is increased by the fact that these differences are accompanied by resemblances as striking to passages in other Platonic writings.</div><div class="sentence"> They are sensible of a want of point in the dialogue and a general inferiority in the ideas, plan, manners, and style.</div><div class="sentence"> They miss the poetical flow, the dramatic verisimilitude, the life and variety of the characters, the dialectic subtlety, the Attic purity, the luminous order, the exquisite urbanity; instead of which they find tautology, obscurity, self-sufficiency, sermonizing, rhetorical declamation, pedantry, egotism, uncouth forms of sentences, and peculiarities in the use of words and idioms.</div><div class="sentence"> They are unable to discover any unity in the patched, irregular structure.</div><div class="sentence"> The speculative element both in government and education is superseded by a narrow economical or religious vein.</div><div class="sentence"> The grace and cheerfulness of Athenian life have disappeared; and a spirit of moroseness and religious intolerance has taken their place.</div><div class="sentence"> The charm of youth is no longer there; the mannerism of age makes itself unpleasantly felt.</div><div class="sentence"> The connection is often imperfect; and there is a want of arrangement, exhibited especially in the enumeration of the laws towards the end of the work.</div><div class="sentence"> The Laws are full of flaws and repetitions.</div><div class="sentence"> The Greek is in places very ungrammatical and intractable.</div><div class="sentence"> A cynical levity is displayed in some passages, and a tone of disappointment and lamentation over human things in others.</div><div class="sentence"> The critics seem also to observe in them bad imitations of thoughts which are better expressed in Plato's other writings.</div><div class="sentence"> Lastly, they wonder how the mind which conceived the Republic could have left the Critias, Hermocrates, and Philosophus incomplete or unwritten, and have devoted the last years of life to the Laws.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  The questions which have been thus indirectly suggested may be considered by us under five or six heads: I, the characters; II, the plan; III, the style; IV, the imitations of other writings of Plato; V; the more general relation of the Laws to the Republic and the other dialogues; and VI, to the existing Athenian and Spartan states.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  I.</div><div class="sentence"> Already in the Philebus the distinctive character of Socrates has disappeared; and in the Timaeus, Sophist, and Statesman his function of chief speaker is handed over to the Pythagorean philosopher Timaeus, and to the Eleatic Stranger, at whose feet he sits, and is silent.</div><div class="sentence"> More and more Plato seems to have felt in his later writings that the character and method of Socrates were no longer suited to be the vehicle of his own philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> He is no longer interrogative but dogmatic; not 'a hesitating enquirer,' but one who speaks with the authority of a legislator.</div><div class="sentence"> Even in the Republic we have seen that the argument which is carried on by Socrates in the old style with Thrasymachus in the first book, soon passes into the form of exposition.</div><div class="sentence"> In the Laws he is nowhere mentioned.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet so completely in the tradition of antiquity is Socrates identified with Plato, that in the criticism of the Laws which we find in the so-called Politics of Aristotle he is supposed by the writer still to be playing his part of the chief speaker (compare Pol.</div><div class="sentence"> ).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  The Laws are discussed by three representatives of Athens, Crete, and Sparta.</div><div class="sentence"> The Athenian, as might be expected, is the protagonist or chief speaker, while the second place is assigned to the Cretan, who, as one of the leaders of a new colony, has a special interest in the conversation.</div><div class="sentence"> At least four-fifths of the answers are put into his mouth.</div><div class="sentence"> The Spartan is every inch a soldier, a man of few words himself, better at deeds than words.</div><div class="sentence"> The Athenian talks to the two others, although they are his equals in age, in the style of a master discoursing to his scholars; he frequently praises himself; he entertains a very poor opinion of the understanding of his companions.</div><div class="sentence"> Certainly the boastfulness and rudeness of the Laws is the reverse of the refined irony and courtesy which characterize the earlier dialogues.</div><div class="sentence"> We are no longer in such good company as in the Phaedrus and Symposium.</div><div class="sentence"> Manners are lost sight of in the earnestness of the speakers, and dogmatic assertions take the place of poetical fancies.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  The scene is laid in Crete, and the conversation is held in the course of a walk from Cnosus to the cave and temple of Zeus, which takes place on one of the longest and hottest days of the year.</div><div class="sentence"> The companions start at dawn, and arrive at the point in their conversation which terminates the fourth book, about noon.</div><div class="sentence"> The God to whose temple they are going is the lawgiver of Crete, and this may be supposed to be the very cave at which he gave his oracles to Minos.</div><div class="sentence"> But the externals of the scene, which are briefly and inartistically described, soon disappear, and we plunge abruptly into the subject of the dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> We are reminded by contrast of the higher art of the Phaedrus, in which the summer's day, and the cool stream, and the chirping of the grasshoppers, and the fragrance of the agnus castus, and the legends of the place are present to the imagination throughout the discourse.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span> <div class="sentence">  The typical Athenian apologizes for the tendency of his countrymen 'to spin a long discussion out of slender materials,' and in a similar spirit the Lacedaemonian Megillus apologizes for the Spartan brevity (compare Thucydid.</div><div class="sentence"> ), acknowledging at the same time that there may be occasions when long discourses are necessary.</div><div class="sentence"> The family of Megillus is the proxenus of Athens at Sparta; and he pays a beautiful compliment to the Athenian, significant of the character of the work, which, though borrowing many elements from Sparta, is also pervaded by an Athenian spirit.</div><div class="sentence"> A good Athenian, he says, is more than ordinarily good, because he is inspired by nature and not manufactured by law.</div><div class="sentence"> The love of listening which is attributed to the Timocrat in the Republic is also exhibited in him.</div><div class="sentence"> The Athenian on his side has a pleasure in speaking to the Lacedaemonian of the struggle in which their ancestors were jointly engaged against the Persians.</div><div class="sentence"> A connexion with Athens is likewise intimated by the Cretan Cleinias.</div><div class="sentence"> He is the relative of Epimenides, whom, by an anachronism of a century,—perhaps arising as Zeller suggests (Plat.</div><div class="sentence"> Stud.)</div><div class="sentence"> out of a confusion of the visit of Epimenides and Diotima (Symp.</div><div class="sentence"> ),—he describes as coming to Athens, not after the attempt of Cylon, but ten years before the Persian war.</div><div class="sentence"> The Cretan and Lacedaemonian hardly contribute at all to the argument of which the Athenian is the expounder; they only supply information when asked about the institutions of their respective countries.</div><div class="sentence"> A kind of simplicity or stupidity is ascribed to them.</div><div class="sentence"> At first, they are dissatisfied with the free criticisms which the Athenian passes upon the laws of Minos and Lycurgus, but they acquiesce in his greater experience and knowledge of the world.</div><div class="sentence"> They admit that there can be no objection to the enquiry; for in the spirit of the legislator himself, they are discussing his laws when there are no young men present to listen.</div><div class="sentence"> They are unwilling to allow that the Spartan and Cretan lawgivers can have been mistaken in honouring courage as the first part of virtue, and are puzzled at hearing for the first time that 'Goods are only evil to the evil.'</div><div class="sentence"> Several times they are on the point of quarrelling, and by an effort learn to restrain their natural feeling (compare Shakespeare, Henry V, act iii.</div><div class="sentence"> sc.</div><div class="sentence"> 2).</div><div class="sentence"> In Book vii., the Lacedaemonian expresses a momentary irritation at the accusation which the Athenian brings against the Spartan institutions, of encouraging licentiousness in their women, but he is reminded by the Cretan that the permission to criticize them freely has been given, and cannot be retracted.</div><div class="sentence"> His only criterion of truth is the authority of the Spartan lawgiver; he is 'interested,' in the novel speculations of the Athenian, but inclines to prefer the ordinances of Lycurgus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span> <div class="sentence">  The three interlocutors all of them speak in the character of old men, which forms a pleasant bond of union between them.</div><div class="sentence"> They have the feelings of old age about youth, about the state, about human things in general.</div><div class="sentence"> Nothing in life seems to be of much importance to them; they are spectators rather than actors, and men in general appear to the Athenian speaker to be the playthings of the Gods and of circumstances.</div><div class="sentence"> Still they have a fatherly care of the young, and are deeply impressed by sentiments of religion.</div><div class="sentence"> They would give confidence to the aged by an increasing use of wine, which, as they get older, is to unloose their tongues and make them sing.</div><div class="sentence"> The prospect of the existence of the soul after death is constantly present to them; though they can hardly be said to have the cheerful hope and resignation which animates Socrates in the Phaedo or Cephalus in the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato appears to be expressing his own feelings in remarks of this sort.</div><div class="sentence"> For at the time of writing the first book of the Laws he was at least seventy-four years of age, if we suppose him to allude to the victory of the Syracusans under Dionysius the Younger over the Locrians, which occurred in the year 356.</div><div class="sentence"> Such a sadness was the natural effect of declining years and failing powers, which make men ask, 'After all, what profit is there in life?'</div><div class="sentence"> They feel that their work is beginning to be over, and are ready to say, 'All the world is a stage;' or, in the actual words of Plato, 'Let us play as good plays as we can,' though 'we must be sometimes serious, which is not agreeable, but necessary.'</div><div class="sentence"> These are feelings which have crossed the minds of reflective persons in all ages, and there is no reason to connect the Laws any more than other parts of Plato's writings with the very uncertain narrative of his life, or to imagine that this melancholy tone is attributable to disappointment at having failed to convert a Sicilian tyrant into a philosopher.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span> <div class="sentence">  II.</div><div class="sentence"> The plan of the Laws is more irregular and has less connexion than any other of the writings of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> As Aristotle says in the Politics, 'The greater part consists of laws'; in Books v, vi, xi, xii the dialogue almost entirely disappears.</div><div class="sentence"> Large portions of them are rather the materials for a work than a finished composition which may rank with the other Platonic dialogues.</div><div class="sentence"> To use his own image, 'Some stones are regularly inserted in the building; others are lying on the ground ready for use.'</div><div class="sentence"> There is probably truth in the tradition that the Laws were not published until after the death of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> We can easily believe that he has left imperfections, which would have been removed if he had lived a few years longer.</div><div class="sentence"> The arrangement might have been improved; the connexion of the argument might have been made plainer, and the sentences more accurately framed.</div><div class="sentence"> Something also may be attributed to the feebleness of old age.</div><div class="sentence"> Even a rough sketch of the Phaedrus or Symposium would have had a very different look.</div><div class="sentence"> There is, however, an interest in possessing one writing of Plato which is in the process of creation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span> <div class="sentence">  We must endeavour to find a thread of order which will carry us through this comparative disorder.</div><div class="sentence"> The first four books are described by Plato himself as the preface or preamble.</div><div class="sentence"> Having arrived at the conclusion that each law should have a preamble, the lucky thought occurs to him at the end of the fourth book that the preceding discourse is the preamble of the whole.</div><div class="sentence"> This preamble or introduction may be abridged as follows:—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span> <div class="sentence">  The institutions of Sparta and Crete are admitted by the Lacedaemonian and Cretan to have one aim only: they were intended by the legislator to inspire courage in war.</div><div class="sentence"> To this the Athenian objects that the true lawgiver should frame his laws with a view to all the virtues and not to one only.</div><div class="sentence"> Better is he who has temperance as well as courage, than he who has courage only; better is he who is faithful in civil broils, than he who is a good soldier only.</div><div class="sentence"> Better, too, is peace than war; the reconciliation than the defeat of an enemy.</div><div class="sentence"> And he who would attain all virtue should be trained amid pleasures as well as pains.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence there should be convivial intercourse among the citizens, and a man's temperance should be tested in his cups, as we test his courage amid dangers.</div><div class="sentence"> He should have a fear of the right sort, as well as a courage of the right sort.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span> <div class="sentence">  At the beginning of the second book the subject of pleasure leads to education, which in the early years of life is wholly a discipline imparted by the means of pleasure and pain.</div><div class="sentence"> The discipline of pleasure is implanted chiefly by the practice of the song and the dance.</div><div class="sentence"> Of these the forms should be fixed, and not allowed to depend on the fickle breath of the multitude.</div><div class="sentence"> There will be choruses of boys, girls, and grown-up persons, and all will be heard repeating the same strain, that 'virtue is happiness.'</div><div class="sentence"> One of them will give the law to the rest; this will be the chorus of aged minstrels, who will sing the most beautiful and the most useful of songs.</div><div class="sentence"> They will require a little wine, to mellow the austerity of age, and make them amenable to the laws.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span> <div class="sentence">  After having laid down as the first principle of politics, that peace, and not war, is the true aim of the legislator, and briefly discussed music and festive intercourse, at the commencement of the third book Plato makes a digression, in which he speaks of the origin of society.</div><div class="sentence"> He describes, first of all, the family; secondly, the patriarchal stage, which is an aggregation of families; thirdly, the founding of regular cities, like Ilium; fourthly, the establishment of a military and political system, like that of Sparta, with which he identifies Argos and Messene, dating from the return of the Heraclidae.</div><div class="sentence"> But the aims of states should be good, or else, like the prayer of Theseus, they may be ruinous to themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> This was the case in two out of three of the Heracleid kingdoms.</div><div class="sentence"> They did not understand that the powers in a state should be balanced.</div><div class="sentence"> The balance of powers saved Sparta, while the excess of tyranny in Persia and the excess of liberty at Athens have been the ruin of both...This discourse on politics is suddenly discovered to have an immediate practical use; for Cleinias the Cretan is about to give laws to a new colony.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span> <div class="sentence">  At the beginning of the fourth book, after enquiring into the circumstances and situation of the colony, the Athenian proceeds to make further reflections.</div><div class="sentence"> Chance, and God, and the skill of the legislator, all co-operate in the formation of states.</div><div class="sentence"> And the most favourable condition for the foundation of a new one is when the government is in the hands of a virtuous tyrant who has the good fortune to be the contemporary of a great legislator.</div><div class="sentence"> But a virtuous tyrant is a contradiction in terms; we can at best only hope to have magistrates who are the servants of reason and the law.</div><div class="sentence"> This leads to the enquiry, what is to be the polity of our new state.</div><div class="sentence"> And the answer is, that we are to fear God, and honour our parents, and to cultivate virtue and justice; these are to be our first principles.</div><div class="sentence"> Laws must be definite, and we should create in the citizens a predisposition to obey them.</div><div class="sentence"> The legislator will teach as well as command; and with this view he will prefix preambles to his principal laws.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span> <div class="sentence">  The fifth book commences in a sort of dithyramb with another and higher preamble about the honour due to the soul, whence are deduced the duties of a man to his parents and his friends, to the suppliant and stranger.</div><div class="sentence"> He should be true and just, free from envy and excess of all sorts, forgiving to crimes which are not incurable and are partly involuntary; and he should have a true taste.</div><div class="sentence"> The noblest life has the greatest pleasures and the fewest pains...Having finished the preamble, and touched on some other preliminary considerations, we proceed to the Laws, beginning with the constitution of the state.</div><div class="sentence"> This is not the best or ideal state, having all things common, but only the second-best, in which the land and houses are to be distributed among 5040 citizens divided into four classes.</div><div class="sentence"> There is to be no gold or silver among them, and they are to have moderate wealth, and to respect number and numerical order in all things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span> <div class="sentence">  In the first part of the sixth book, Plato completes his sketch of the constitution by the appointment of officers.</div><div class="sentence"> He explains the manner in which guardians of the law, generals, priests, wardens of town and country, ministers of education, and other magistrates are to be appointed; and also in what way courts of appeal are to be constituted, and omissions in the law to be supplied.</div><div class="sentence"> Next—and at this point the Laws strictly speaking begin—there follow enactments respecting marriage and the procreation of children, respecting property in slaves as well as of other kinds, respecting houses, married life, common tables for men and women.</div><div class="sentence"> The question of age in marriage suggests the consideration of a similar question about the time for holding offices, and for military service, which had been previously omitted.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span> <div class="sentence">  Resuming the order of the discussion, which was indicated in the previous book, from marriage and birth we proceed to education in the seventh book.</div><div class="sentence"> Education is to begin at or rather before birth; to be continued for a time by mothers and nurses under the supervision of the state; finally, to comprehend music and gymnastics.</div><div class="sentence"> Under music is included reading, writing, playing on the lyre, arithmetic, geometry, and a knowledge of astronomy sufficient to preserve the minds of the citizens from impiety in after-life.</div><div class="sentence"> Gymnastics are to be practised chiefly with a view to their use in war.</div><div class="sentence"> The discussion of education, which was lightly touched upon in Book ii, is here completed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span> <div class="sentence">  The eighth book contains regulations for civil life, beginning with festivals, games, and contests, military exercises and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> On such occasions Plato seems to see young men and maidens meeting together, and hence he is led into discussing the relations of the sexes, the evil consequences which arise out of the indulgence of the passions, and the remedies for them.</div><div class="sentence"> Then he proceeds to speak of agriculture, of arts and trades, of buying and selling, and of foreign commerce.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span> <div class="sentence">  The remaining books of the Laws, ix-xii, are chiefly concerned with criminal offences.</div><div class="sentence"> In the first class are placed offences against the Gods, especially sacrilege or robbery of temples: next follow offences against the state,—conspiracy, treason, theft.</div><div class="sentence"> The mention of thefts suggests a distinction between voluntary and involuntary, curable and incurable offences.</div><div class="sentence"> Proceeding to the greater crime of homicide, Plato distinguishes between mere homicide, manslaughter, which is partly voluntary and partly involuntary, and murder, which arises from avarice, ambition, fear.</div><div class="sentence"> He also enumerates murders by kindred, murders by slaves, wounds with or without intent to kill, wounds inflicted in anger, crimes of or against slaves, insults to parents.</div><div class="sentence"> To these, various modes of purification or degrees of punishment are assigned, and the terrors of another world are also invoked against them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span> <div class="sentence">  At the beginning of Book x, all acts of violence, including sacrilege, are summed up in a single law.</div><div class="sentence"> The law is preceded by an admonition, in which the offenders are informed that no one ever did an unholy act or said an unlawful word while he retained his belief in the existence of the Gods; but either he denied their existence, or he believed that they took no care of man, or that they might be turned from their course by sacrifices and prayers.</div><div class="sentence"> The remainder of the book is devoted to the refutation of these three classes of unbelievers, and concludes with the means to be taken for their reformation, and the announcement of their punishments if they continue obstinate and impenitent.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span> <div class="sentence">  III.</div><div class="sentence"> The style of the Laws differs in several important respects from that of the other dialogues of Plato: (1) in the want of character, power, and lively illustration; (2) in the frequency of mannerisms (compare Introduction to the Philebus); (3) in the form and rhythm of the sentences; (4) in the use of words.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, there are many passages (5) which are characterized by a sort of ethical grandeur; and (6) in which, perhaps, a greater insight into human nature, and a greater reach of practical wisdom is shown, than in any other of Plato's writings.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span> <div class="sentence">  1.</div><div class="sentence"> The discourse of the three old men is described by themselves as an old man's game of play.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet there is little of the liveliness of a game in their mode of treating the subject.</div><div class="sentence"> They do not throw the ball to and fro, but two out of the three are listeners to the third, who is constantly asserting his superior wisdom and opportunities of knowledge, and apologizing (not without reason) for his own want of clearness of speech.</div><div class="sentence"> He will 'carry them over the stream;' he will answer for them when the argument is beyond their comprehension; he is afraid of their ignorance of mathematics, and thinks that gymnastic is likely to be more intelligible to them;—he has repeated his words several times, and yet they cannot understand him.</div><div class="sentence"> The subject did not properly take the form of dialogue, and also the literary vigour of Plato had passed away.</div><div class="sentence"> The old men speak as they might be expected to speak, and in this there is a touch of dramatic truth.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato has given the Laws that form or want of form which indicates the failure of natural power.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no regular plan—none of that consciousness of what has preceded and what is to follow, which makes a perfect style,—but there are several attempts at a plan; the argument is 'pulled up,' and frequent explanations are offered why a particular topic was introduced.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span> <div class="sentence">  The fictions of the Laws have no longer the verisimilitude which is characteristic of the Phaedrus and the Timaeus, or even of the Statesman.</div><div class="sentence"> We can hardly suppose that an educated Athenian would have placed the visit of Epimenides to Athens ten years before the Persian war, or have imagined that a war with Messene prevented the Lacedaemonians from coming to the rescue of Hellas.</div><div class="sentence"> The narrative of the origin of the Dorian institutions, which are said to have been due to a fear of the growing power of the Assyrians, is a plausible invention, which may be compared with the tale of the island of Atlantis and the poem of Solon, but is not accredited by similar arts of deception.</div><div class="sentence"> The other statement that the Dorians were Achaean exiles assembled by Dorieus, and the assertion that Troy was included in the Assyrian Empire, have some foundation (compare for the latter point, Diod.</div><div class="sentence"> Sicul.).</div><div class="sentence"> Nor is there anywhere in the Laws that lively enargeia, that vivid mise en scene, which is as characteristic of Plato as of some modern novelists.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span> <div class="sentence">  The old men are afraid of the ridicule which 'will fall on their heads more than enough,' and they do not often indulge in a joke.</div><div class="sentence"> In one of the few which occur, the book of the Laws, if left incomplete, is compared to a monster wandering about without a head.</div><div class="sentence"> But we no longer breathe the atmosphere of humour which pervades the Symposium and the Euthydemus, in which we pass within a few sentences from the broadest Aristophanic joke to the subtlest refinement of wit and fancy; instead of this, in the Laws an impression of baldness and feebleness is often left upon our minds.</div><div class="sentence"> Some of the most amusing descriptions, as, for example, of children roaring for the first three years of life; or of the Athenians walking into the country with fighting-cocks under their arms; or of the slave doctor who knocks about his patients finely; and the gentleman doctor who courteously persuades them; or of the way of keeping order in the theatre, 'by a hint from a stick,' are narrated with a commonplace gravity; but where we find this sort of dry humour we shall not be far wrong in thinking that the writer intended to make us laugh.</div><div class="sentence"> The seriousness of age takes the place of the jollity of youth.</div><div class="sentence"> Life should have holidays and festivals; yet we rebuke ourselves when we laugh, and take our pleasures sadly.</div><div class="sentence"> The irony of the earlier dialogues, of which some traces occur in the tenth book, is replaced by a severity which hardly condescends to regard human things.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Let us say, if you please, that man is of some account, but I was speaking of him in comparison with God.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span> <div class="sentence">  The imagery and illustrations are poor in themselves, and are not assisted by the surrounding phraseology.</div><div class="sentence"> We have seen how in the Republic, and in the earlier dialogues, figures of speech such as 'the wave,' 'the drone,' 'the chase,' 'the bride,' appear and reappear at intervals.</div><div class="sentence"> Notes are struck which are repeated from time to time, as in a strain of music.</div><div class="sentence"> There is none of this subtle art in the Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> The illustrations, such as the two kinds of doctors, 'the three kinds of funerals,' the fear potion, the puppet, the painter leaving a successor to restore his picture, the 'person stopping to consider where three ways meet,' the 'old laws about water of which he will not divert the course,' can hardly be said to do much credit to Plato's invention.</div><div class="sentence"> The citations from the poets have lost that fanciful character which gave them their charm in the earlier dialogues.</div><div class="sentence"> We are tired of images taken from the arts of navigation, or archery, or weaving, or painting, or medicine, or music.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet the comparisons of life to a tragedy, or of the working of mind to the revolution of the self-moved, or of the aged parent to the image of a God dwelling in the house, or the reflection that 'man is made to be the plaything of God, and that this rightly considered is the best of him,' have great beauty.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span> <div class="sentence">  3.</div><div class="sentence"> The perfection of style is variety in unity, freedom, ease, clearness, the power of saying anything, and of striking any note in the scale of human feelings without impropriety; and such is the divine gift of language possessed by Plato in the Symposium and Phaedrus.</div><div class="sentence"> From this there are many fallings-off in the Laws: first, in the structure of the sentences, which are rhythmical and monotonous,—the formal and sophistical manner of the age is superseding the natural genius of Plato: secondly, many of them are of enormous length, and the latter end often forgets the beginning of them,—they seem never to have received the second thoughts of the author; either the emphasis is wrongly placed, or there is a want of point in a clause; or an absolute case occurs which is not properly separated from the rest of the sentence; or words are aggregated in a manner which fails to show their relation to one another; or the connecting particles are omitted at the beginning of sentences; the uses of the relative and antecedent are more indistinct, the changes of person and number more frequent, examples of pleonasm, tautology, and periphrasis, antitheses of positive and negative, false emphasis, and other affectations, are more numerous than in the other writings of Plato; there is also a more common and sometimes unmeaning use of qualifying formulae, os epos eipein, kata dunamin, and of double expressions, pante pantos, oudame oudamos, opos kai ope—these are too numerous to be attributed to errors in the text; again, there is an over-curious adjustment of verb and participle, noun and epithet, and other artificial forms of cadence and expression take the place of natural variety: thirdly, the absence of metaphorical language is remarkable—the style is not devoid of ornament, but the ornament is of a debased rhetorical kind, patched on to instead of growing out of the subject; there is a great command of words, and a laboured use of them; forced attempts at metaphor occur in several passages,—e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> parocheteuein logois; ta men os tithemena ta d os paratithemena; oinos kolazomenos upo nephontos eterou theou; the plays on the word nomos = nou dianome, ode etara: fourthly, there is a foolish extravagance of language in other passages,—'the swinish ignorance of arithmetic;' 'the justice and suitableness of the discourse on laws;' over-emphasis; 'best of Greeks,' said of all the Greeks, and the like: fifthly, poor and insipid illustrations are also common: sixthly, we may observe an excessive use of climax and hyperbole, aischron legein chre pros autous doulon te kai doulen kai paida kai ei pos oion te olen ten oikian: dokei touto to epitedeuma kata phusin tas peri ta aphrodisia edonas ou monon anthropon alla kai therion diephtharkenai.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span> <div class="sentence">  4.</div><div class="sentence"> The peculiarities in the use of words which occur in the Laws have been collected by Zeller (Platonische Studien) and Stallbaum (Legg.</div><div class="sentence"> ): first, in the use of nouns, such as allodemia, apeniautesis, glukuthumia, diatheter, thrasuxenia, koros, megalonoia, paidourgia: secondly, in the use of adjectives, such as aistor, biodotes, echthodopos, eitheos, chronios, and of adverbs, such as aniditi, anatei, nepoivei: thirdly, in the use of verbs, such as athurein, aissein (aixeien eipein), euthemoneisthai, parapodizesthai, sebein, temelein, tetan.</div><div class="sentence"> These words however, as Stallbaum remarks, are formed according to analogy, and nearly all of them have the support of some poetical or other authority.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span> <div class="sentence">  Zeller and Stallbaum have also collected forms of words in the Laws, differing from the forms of the same words which occur in other places: e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> blabos for blabe, abios for abiotos, acharistos for acharis, douleios for doulikos, paidelos for paidikos, exagrio for exagriaino, ileoumai for ilaskomai, and the Ionic word sophronistus, meaning 'correction.'</div><div class="sentence"> Zeller has noted a fondness for substantives ending in -ma and -sis, such as georgema, diapauma, epithumema, zemioma, komodema, omilema; blapsis, loidoresis, paraggelsis, and others; also a use of substantives in the plural, which are commonly found only in the singular, maniai, atheotetes, phthonoi, phoboi, phuseis; also, a peculiar use of prepositions in composition, as in eneirgo, apoblapto, dianomotheteo, dieiretai, dieulabeisthai, and other words; also, a frequent occurrence of the Ionic datives plural in -aisi and -oisi, perhaps used for the sake of giving an ancient or archaic effect.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span> <div class="sentence">  To these peculiarities of words he has added a list of peculiar expressions and constructions.</div><div class="sentence"> Among the most characteristic are the following: athuta pallakon spermata; amorphoi edrai; osa axiomata pros archontas; oi kata polin kairoi; muthos, used in several places of 'the discourse about laws;' and connected with this the frequent use of paramuthion and paramutheisthai in the general sense of 'address,' 'addressing'; aimulos eros; ataphoi praxeis; muthos akephalos; ethos euthuporon.</div><div class="sentence"> He remarks also on the frequent employment of the abstract for the concrete; e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> uperesia for uperetai, phugai for phugades, mechanai in the sense of 'contrivers,' douleia for douloi, basileiai for basileis, mainomena kedeumata for ganaika mainomenen; e chreia ton paidon in the sense of 'indigent children,' and paidon ikanotes; to ethos tes apeirias for e eiothuia apeiria; kuparitton upse te kai kalle thaumasia for kuparittoi mala upselai kai kalai.</div><div class="sentence"> He further notes some curious uses of the genitive case, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> philias omologiai, maniai orges, laimargiai edones, cheimonon anupodesiai, anosioi plegon tolmai; and of the dative, omiliai echthrois, nomothesiai, anosioi plegon tolmai; and of the dative omiliai echthrois, nomothesiai epitropois; and also some rather uncommon periphrases, thremmata Neilou, xuggennetor teknon for alochos, Mouses lexis for poiesis, zographon paides, anthropon spermata and the like; the fondness for particles of limitation, especially tis and ge, sun tisi charisi, tois ge dunamenois and the like; the pleonastic use of tanun, of os, of os eros eipein, of ekastote; and the periphrastic use of the preposition peri.</div><div class="sentence"> Lastly, he observes the tendency to hyperbata or transpositions of words, and to rhythmical uniformity as well as grammatical irregularity in the structure of the sentences.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span> <div class="sentence">  For nearly all the expressions which are adduced by Zeller as arguments against the genuineness of the Laws, Stallbaum finds some sort of authority.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no real ground for doubting that the work was written by Plato, merely because several words occur in it which are not found in his other writings.</div><div class="sentence"> An imitator may preserve the usual phraseology of a writer better than he would himself.</div><div class="sentence"> But, on the other hand, the fact that authorities may be quoted in support of most of these uses of words, does not show that the diction is not peculiar.</div><div class="sentence"> Several of them seem to be poetical or dialectical, and exhibit an attempt to enlarge the limits of Greek prose by the introduction of Homeric and tragic expressions.</div><div class="sentence"> Most of them do not appear to have retained any hold on the later language of Greece.</div><div class="sentence"> Like several experiments in language of the writers of the Elizabethan age, they were afterwards lost; and though occasionally found in Plutarch and imitators of Plato, they have not been accepted by Aristotle or passed into the common dialect of Greece.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span> <div class="sentence">  5.</div><div class="sentence"> Unequal as the Laws are in style, they contain a few passages which are very grand and noble.</div><div class="sentence"> For example, the address to the poets: 'Best of strangers, we also are poets of the best and noblest tragedy; for our whole state is an imitation of the best and noblest life, which we affirm to be indeed the very truth of tragedy.'</div><div class="sentence"> Or again, the sight of young men and maidens in friendly intercourse with one another, suggesting the dangers to which youth is liable from the violence of passion; or the eloquent denunciation of unnatural lusts in the same passage; or the charming thought that the best legislator 'orders war for the sake of peace and not peace for the sake of war;' or the pleasant allusion, 'O Athenian—inhabitant of Attica, I will not say, for you seem to me worthy to be named after the Goddess Athene because you go back to first principles;' or the pithy saying, 'Many a victory has been and will be suicidal to the victors, but education is never suicidal;' or the fine expression that 'the walls of a city should be allowed to sleep in the earth, and that we should not attempt to disinter them;' or the remark that 'God is the measure of all things in a sense far higher than any man can be;' or that 'a man should be from the first a partaker of the truth, that he may live a true man as long as possible;' or the principle repeatedly laid down, that 'the sins of the fathers are not to be visited on the children;' or the description of the funeral rites of those priestly sages who depart in innocence; or the noble sentiment, that we should do more justice to slaves than to equals; or the curious observation, founded, perhaps, on his own experience, that there are a few 'divine men in every state however corrupt, whose conversation is of inestimable value;' or the acute remark, that public opinion is to be respected, because the judgments of mankind about virtue are better than their practice; or the deep religious and also modern feeling which pervades the tenth book (whatever may be thought of the arguments); the sense of the duty of living as a part of a whole, and in dependence on the will of God, who takes care of the least things as well as the greatest; and the picture of parents praying for their children—not as we may say, slightly altering the words of Plato, as if there were no truth or reality in the Gentile religions, but as if there were the greatest—are very striking to us.</div><div class="sentence"> We must remember that the Laws, unlike the Republic, do not exhibit an ideal state, but are supposed to be on the level of human motives and feelings; they are also on the level of the popular religion, though elevated and purified: hence there is an attempt made to show that the pleasant is also just.</div><div class="sentence"> But, on the other hand, the priority of the soul to the body, and of God to the soul, is always insisted upon as the true incentive to virtue; especially with great force and eloquence at the commencement of Book v. And the work of legislation is carried back to the first principles of morals.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span> <div class="sentence">  6.</div><div class="sentence"> No other writing of Plato shows so profound an insight into the world and into human nature as the Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> That 'cities will never cease from ill until they are better governed,' is the text of the Laws as well as of the Statesman and Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> The principle that the balance of power preserves states; the reflection that no one ever passed his whole life in disbelief of the Gods; the remark that the characters of men are best seen in convivial intercourse; the observation that the people must be allowed to share not only in the government, but in the administration of justice; the desire to make laws, not with a view to courage only, but to all virtue; the clear perception that education begins with birth, or even, as he would say, before birth; the attempt to purify religion; the modern reflections, that punishment is not vindictive, and that limits must be set to the power of bequest; the impossibility of undeceiving the victims of quacks and jugglers; the provision for water, and for other requirements of health, and for concealing the bodies of the dead with as little hurt as possible to the living; above all, perhaps, the distinct consciousness that under the actual circumstances of mankind the ideal cannot be carried out, and yet may be a guiding principle—will appear to us, if we remember that we are still in the dawn of politics, to show a great depth of political wisdom.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span> <div class="sentence">  IV.</div><div class="sentence"> The Laws of Plato contain numerous passages which closely resemble other passages in his writings.</div><div class="sentence"> And at first sight a suspicion arises that the repetition shows the unequal hand of the imitator.</div><div class="sentence"> For why should a writer say over again, in a more imperfect form, what he had already said in his most finished style and manner?</div><div class="sentence"> And yet it may be urged on the other side that an author whose original powers are beginning to decay will be very liable to repeat himself, as in conversation, so in books.</div><div class="sentence"> He may have forgotten what he had written before; he may be unconscious of the decline of his own powers.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence arises a question of great interest, bearing on the genuineness of ancient writers.</div><div class="sentence"> Is there any criterion by which we can distinguish the genuine resemblance from the spurious, or, in other words, the repetition of a thought or passage by an author himself from the appropriation of it by another?</div><div class="sentence"> The question has, perhaps, never been fully discussed; and, though a real one, does not admit of a precise answer.</div><div class="sentence"> A few general considerations on the subject may be offered:—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span> <div class="sentence">  (a) Is the difference such as might be expected to arise at different times of life or under different circumstances?—There would be nothing surprising in a writer, as he grew older, losing something of his own originality, and falling more and more under the spirit of his age.</div><div class="sentence"> 'What a genius I had when I wrote that book!'</div><div class="sentence"> was the pathetic exclamation of a famous English author, when in old age he chanced to take up one of his early works.</div><div class="sentence"> There would be nothing surprising again in his losing somewhat of his powers of expression, and becoming less capable of framing language into a harmonious whole.</div><div class="sentence"> There would also be a strong presumption that if the variation of style was uniform, it was attributable to some natural cause, and not to the arts of the imitator.</div><div class="sentence"> The inferiority might be the result of feebleness and of want of activity of mind.</div><div class="sentence"> But the natural weakness of a great author would commonly be different from the artificial weakness of an imitator; it would be continuous and uniform.</div><div class="sentence"> The latter would be apt to fill his work with irregular patches, sometimes taken verbally from the writings of the author whom he personated, but rarely acquiring his spirit.</div><div class="sentence"> His imitation would be obvious, irregular, superficial.</div><div class="sentence"> The patches of purple would be easily detected among his threadbare and tattered garments.</div><div class="sentence"> He would rarely take the pains to put the same thought into other words.</div><div class="sentence"> There were many forgeries in English literature which attained a considerable degree of success 50 or 100 years ago; but it is doubtful whether attempts such as these could now escape detection, if there were any writings of the same author or of the same age to be compared with them.</div><div class="sentence"> And ancient forgers were much less skilful than modern; they were far from being masters in the art of deception, and had rarely any motive for being so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span> <div class="sentence">  (b) But, secondly, the imitator will commonly be least capable of understanding or imitating that part of a great writer which is most characteristic of him.</div><div class="sentence"> In every man's writings there is something like himself and unlike others, which gives individuality.</div><div class="sentence"> To appreciate this latent quality would require a kindred mind, and minute study and observation.</div><div class="sentence"> There are a class of similarities which may be called undesigned coincidences, which are so remote as to be incapable of being borrowed from one another, and yet, when they are compared, find a natural explanation in their being the work of the same mind.</div><div class="sentence"> The imitator might copy the turns of style—he might repeat images or illustrations, but he could not enter into the inner circle of Platonic philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> He would understand that part of it which became popular in the next generation, as for example, the doctrine of ideas or of numbers: he might approve of communism.</div><div class="sentence"> But the higher flights of Plato about the science of dialectic, or the unity of virtue, or a person who is above the law, would be unintelligible to him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">040</span> <div class="sentence">  (c) The argument from imitation assumes a different character when the supposed imitations are associated with other passages having the impress of original genius.</div><div class="sentence"> The strength of the argument from undesigned coincidences of style is much increased when they are found side by side with thoughts and expressions which can only have come from a great original writer.</div><div class="sentence"> The great excellence, not only of the whole, but even of the parts of writings, is a strong proof of their genuineness—for although the great writer may fall below, the forger or imitator cannot rise much above himself.</div><div class="sentence"> Whether we can attribute the worst parts of a work to a forger and the best to a great writer,—as for example, in the case of some of Shakespeare's plays,—depends upon the probability that they have been interpolated, or have been the joint work of two writers; and this can only be established either by express evidence or by a comparison of other writings of the same class.</div><div class="sentence"> If the interpolation or double authorship of Greek writings in the time of Plato could be shown to be common, then a question, perhaps insoluble, would arise, not whether the whole, but whether parts of the Platonic dialogues are genuine, and, if parts only, which parts.</div><div class="sentence"> Hebrew prophecies and Homeric poems and Laws of Manu may have grown together in early times, but there is no reason to think that any of the dialogues of Plato is the result of a similar process of accumulation.</div><div class="sentence"> It is therefore rash to say with Oncken (Die Staatslehre des Aristoteles) that the form in which Aristotle knew the Laws of Plato must have been different from that in which they have come down to us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span> <div class="sentence">  It must be admitted that these principles are difficult of application.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet a criticism may be worth making which rests only on probabilities or impressions.</div><div class="sentence"> Great disputes will arise about the merits of different passages, about what is truly characteristic and original or trivial and borrowed.</div><div class="sentence"> Many have thought the Laws to be one of the greatest of Platonic writings, while in the judgment of Mr. Grote they hardly rise above the level of the forged epistles.</div><div class="sentence"> The manner in which a writer would or would not have written at a particular time of life must be acknowledged to be a matter of conjecture.</div><div class="sentence"> But enough has been said to show that similarities of a certain kind, whether criticism is able to detect them or not, may be such as must be attributed to an original writer, and not to a mere imitator.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span> <div class="sentence">  (d) Applying these principles to the case of the Laws, we have now to point out that they contain the class of refined or unconscious similarities which are indicative of genuineness.</div><div class="sentence"> The parallelisms are like the repetitions of favourite thoughts into which every one is apt to fall unawares in conversation or in writing.</div><div class="sentence"> They are found in a work which contains many beautiful and remarkable passages.</div><div class="sentence"> We may therefore begin by claiming this presumption in their favour.</div><div class="sentence"> Such undesigned coincidences, as we may venture to call them, are the following.</div><div class="sentence"> The conception of justice as the union of temperance, wisdom, courage (Laws; Republic): the latent idea of dialectic implied in the notion of dividing laws after the kinds of virtue (Laws); the approval of the method of looking at one idea gathered from many things, 'than which a truer was never discovered by any man' (compare Republic): or again the description of the Laws as parents (Laws; Republic): the assumption that religion has been already settled by the oracle of Delphi (Laws; Republic), to which an appeal is also made in special cases (Laws): the notion of the battle with self, a paradox for which Plato in a manner apologizes both in the Laws and the Republic: the remark (Laws) that just men, even when they are deformed in body, may still be perfectly beautiful in respect of the excellent justice of their minds (compare Republic): the argument that ideals are none the worse because they cannot be carried out (Laws; Republic): the near approach to the idea of good in 'the principle which is common to all the four virtues,' a truth which the guardians must be compelled to recognize (Laws; compare Republic): or again the recognition by reason of the right pleasure and pain, which had previously been matter of habit (Laws; Republic): or the blasphemy of saying that the excellency of music is to give pleasure (Laws; Republic): again the story of the Sidonian Cadmus (Laws), which is a variation of the Phoenician tale of the earth-born men (Republic): the comparison of philosophy to a yelping she-dog, both in the Republic and in the Laws: the remark that no man can practise two trades (Laws; Republic): or the advantage of the middle condition (Laws; Republic): the tendency to speak of principles as moulds or forms; compare the ekmageia of song (Laws), and the tupoi of religion (Republic): or the remark (Laws) that 'the relaxation of justice makes many cities out of one,' which may be compared with the Republic: or the description of lawlessness 'creeping in little by little in the fashions of music and overturning all things,'—to us a paradox, but to Plato's mind a fixed idea, which is found in the Laws as well as in the Republic: or the figure of the parts of the human body under which the parts of the state are described (Laws; Republic): the apology for delay and diffuseness, which occurs not unfrequently in the Republic, is carried to an excess in the Laws (compare Theaet.</div><div class="sentence"> ): the remarkable thought (Laws) that the soul of the sun is better than the sun, agrees with the relation in which the idea of good stands to the sun in the Republic, and with the substitution of mind for the idea of good in the Philebus: the passage about the tragic poets (Laws) agrees generally with the treatment of them in the Republic, but is more finely conceived, and worked out in a nobler spirit.</div><div class="sentence"> Some lesser similarities of thought and manner should not be omitted, such as the mention of the thirty years' old students in the Republic, and the fifty years' old choristers in the Laws; or the making of the citizens out of wax (Laws) compared with the other image (Republic); or the number of the tyrant (729), which is NEARLY equal with the number of days and nights in the year (730), compared with the 'slight correction' of the sacred number 5040, which is divisible by all the numbers from 1 to 12 except 11, and divisible by 11, if two families be deducted; or once more, we may compare the ignorance of solid geometry of which he complains in the Republic and the puzzle about fractions with the difficulty in the Laws about commensurable and incommensurable quantities—and the malicious emphasis on the word gunaikeios (Laws) with the use of the same word (Republic).</div><div class="sentence"> These and similar passages tend to show that the author of the Republic is also the author of the Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> They are echoes of the same voice, expressions of the same mind, coincidences too subtle to have been invented by the ingenuity of any imitator.</div><div class="sentence"> The force of the argument is increased, if we remember that no passage in the Laws is exactly copied,—nowhere do five or six words occur together which are found together elsewhere in Plato's writings.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">043</span> <div class="sentence">  In other dialogues of Plato, as well as in the Republic, there are to be found parallels with the Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> Such resemblances, as we might expect, occur chiefly (but not exclusively) in the dialogues which, on other grounds, we may suppose to be of later date.</div><div class="sentence"> The punishment of evil is to be like evil men (Laws), as he says also in the Theaetetus.</div><div class="sentence"> Compare again the dependence of tragedy and comedy on one another, of which he gives the reason in the Laws—'For serious things cannot be understood without laughable, nor opposites at all without opposites, if a man is really to have intelligence of either'; here he puts forward the principle which is the groundwork of the thesis of Socrates in the Symposium, 'that the genius of tragedy is the same as that of comedy, and that the writer of comedy ought to be a writer of tragedy also.'</div><div class="sentence"> There is a truth and right which is above Law (Laws), as we learn also from the Statesman.</div><div class="sentence"> That men are the possession of the Gods (Laws), is a reflection which likewise occurs in the Phaedo.</div><div class="sentence"> The remark, whether serious or ironical (Laws), that 'the sons of the Gods naturally believed in the Gods, because they had the means of knowing about them,' is found in the Timaeus.</div><div class="sentence"> The reign of Cronos, who is the divine ruler (Laws), is a reminiscence of the Statesman.</div><div class="sentence"> It is remarkable that in the Sophist and Statesman (Soph.</div><div class="sentence"> ), Plato, speaking in the character of the Eleatic Stranger, has already put on the old man.</div><div class="sentence"> The madness of the poets, again, is a favourite notion of Plato's, which occurs also in the Laws, as well as in the Phaedrus, Ion, and elsewhere.</div><div class="sentence"> There are traces in the Laws of the same desire to base speculation upon history which we find in the Critias.</div><div class="sentence"> Once more, there is a striking parallel with the paradox of the Gorgias, that 'if you do evil, it is better to be punished than to be unpunished,' in the Laws: 'To live having all goods without justice and virtue is the greatest of evils if life be immortal, but not so great if the bad man lives but a short time.'</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span> <div class="sentence">  V. The relation of the Republic to the Laws is clearly set forth by Plato in the Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> The Republic is the best state, the Laws is the best possible under the existing conditions of the Greek world.</div><div class="sentence"> The Republic is the ideal, in which no man calls anything his own, which may or may not have existed in some remote clime, under the rule of some God, or son of a God (who can say?</div><div class="sentence"> ), but is, at any rate, the pattern of all other states and the exemplar of human life.</div><div class="sentence"> The Laws distinctly acknowledge what the Republic partly admits, that the ideal is inimitable by us, but that we should 'lift up our eyes to the heavens' and try to regulate our lives according to the divine image.</div><div class="sentence"> The citizens are no longer to have wives and children in common, and are no longer to be under the government of philosophers.</div><div class="sentence"> But the spirit of communism or communion is to continue among them, though reverence for the sacredness of the family, and respect of children for parents, not promiscuous hymeneals, are now the foundation of the state; the sexes are to be as nearly on an equality as possible; they are to meet at common tables, and to share warlike pursuits (if the women will consent), and to have a common education.</div><div class="sentence"> The legislator has taken the place of the philosopher, but a council of elders is retained, who are to fulfil the duties of the legislator when he has passed out of life.</div><div class="sentence"> The addition of younger persons to this council by co-optation is an improvement on the governing body of the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> The scheme of education in the Laws is of a far lower kind than that which Plato had conceived in the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> There he would have his rulers trained in all knowledge meeting in the idea of good, of which the different branches of mathematical science are but the hand-maidens or ministers; here he treats chiefly of popular education, stopping short with the preliminary sciences,—these are to be studied partly with a view to their practical usefulness, which in the Republic he holds cheap, and even more with a view to avoiding impiety, of which in the Republic he says nothing; he touches very lightly on dialectic, which is still to be retained for the rulers.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet in the Laws there remain traces of the old educational ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> He is still for banishing the poets; and as he finds the works of prose writers equally dangerous, he would substitute for them the study of his own laws.</div><div class="sentence"> He insists strongly on the importance of mathematics as an educational instrument.</div><div class="sentence"> He is no more reconciled to the Greek mythology than in the Republic, though he would rather say nothing about it out of a reverence for antiquity; and he is equally willing to have recourse to fictions, if they have a moral tendency.</div><div class="sentence"> His thoughts recur to a golden age in which the sanctity of oaths was respected and in which men living nearer the Gods were more disposed to believe in them; but we must legislate for the world as it is, now that the old beliefs have passed away.</div><div class="sentence"> Though he is no longer fired with dialectical enthusiasm, he would compel the guardians to 'look at one idea gathered from many things,' and to 'perceive the principle which is the same in all the four virtues.'</div><div class="sentence"> He still recognizes the enormous influence of music, in which every youth is to be trained for three years; and he seems to attribute the existing degeneracy of the Athenian state and the laxity of morals partly to musical innovation, manifested in the unnatural divorce of the instrument and the voice, of the rhythm from the words, and partly to the influence of the mob who ruled at the theatres.</div><div class="sentence"> He assimilates the education of the two sexes, as far as possible, both in music and gymnastic, and, as in the Republic, he would give to gymnastic a purely military character.</div><div class="sentence"> In marriage, his object is still to produce the finest children for the state.</div><div class="sentence"> As in the Statesman, he would unite in wedlock dissimilar natures—the passionate with the dull, the courageous with the gentle.</div><div class="sentence"> And the virtuous tyrant of the Statesman, who has no place in the Republic, again appears.</div><div class="sentence"> In this, as in all his writings, he has the strongest sense of the degeneracy and incapacity of the rulers of his own time.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">046</span> <div class="sentence">  In the Laws, the philosophers, if not banished, like the poets, are at least ignored; and religion takes the place of philosophy in the regulation of human life.</div><div class="sentence"> It must however be remembered that the religion of Plato is co-extensive with morality, and is that purified religion and mythology of which he speaks in the second book of the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no real discrepancy in the two works.</div><div class="sentence"> In a practical treatise, he speaks of religion rather than of philosophy; just as he appears to identify virtue with pleasure, and rather seeks to find the common element of the virtues than to maintain his old paradoxical theses that they are one, or that they are identical with knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> The dialectic and the idea of good, which even Glaucon in the Republic could not understand, would be out of place in a less ideal work.</div><div class="sentence"> There may also be a change in his own mind, the purely intellectual aspect of philosophy having a diminishing interest to him in his old age.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">047</span> <div class="sentence">  Some confusion occurs in the passage in which Plato speaks of the Republic, occasioned by his reference to a third state, which he proposes (D.V.)</div><div class="sentence"> hereafter to expound.</div><div class="sentence"> Like many other thoughts in the Laws, the allusion is obscure from not being worked out.</div><div class="sentence"> Aristotle (Polit.)</div><div class="sentence"> speaks of a state which is neither the best absolutely, nor the best under existing conditions, but an imaginary state, inferior to either, destitute, as he supposes, of the necessaries of life—apparently such a beginning of primitive society as is described in Laws iii.</div><div class="sentence"> But it is not clear that by this the third state of Plato is intended.</div><div class="sentence"> It is possible that Plato may have meant by his third state an historical sketch, bearing the same relation to the Laws which the unfinished Critias would have borne to the Republic; or he may, perhaps, have intended to describe a state more nearly approximating than the Laws to existing Greek states.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">048</span> <div class="sentence">  The Statesman is a mere fragment when compared with the Laws, yet combining a second interest of dialectic as well as politics, which is wanting in the larger work.</div><div class="sentence"> Several points of similarity and contrast may be observed between them.</div><div class="sentence"> In some respects the Statesman is even more ideal than the Republic, looking back to a former state of paradisiacal life, in which the Gods ruled over mankind, as the Republic looks forward to a coming kingdom of philosophers.</div><div class="sentence"> Of this kingdom of Cronos there is also mention in the Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, in the Statesman, the Eleatic Stranger rises above law to the conception of the living voice of the lawgiver, who is able to provide for individual cases.</div><div class="sentence"> A similar thought is repeated in the Laws: 'If in the order of nature, and by divine destiny, a man were able to apprehend the truth about these things, he would have no need of laws to rule over him; for there is no law or order above knowledge, nor can mind without impiety be deemed the subject or slave of any, but rather the lord of all.'</div><div class="sentence"> The union of opposite natures, who form the warp and the woof of the political web, is a favourite thought which occurs in both dialogues (Laws; Statesman).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">049</span> <div class="sentence">  The Laws are confessedly a Second-best, an inferior Ideal, to which Plato has recourse, when he finds that the city of Philosophers is no longer 'within the horizon of practical politics.'</div><div class="sentence"> But it is curious to observe that the higher Ideal is always returning (compare Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Polit.</div><div class="sentence"> ), and that he is not much nearer the actual fact, nor more on the level of ordinary life in the Laws than in the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> It is also interesting to remark that the new Ideal is always falling away, and that he hardly supposes the one to be more capable of being realized than the other.</div><div class="sentence"> Human beings are troublesome to manage; and the legislator cannot adapt his enactments to the infinite variety of circumstances; after all he must leave the administration of them to his successors; and though he would have liked to make them as permanent as they are in Egypt, he cannot escape from the necessity of change.</div><div class="sentence"> At length Plato is obliged to institute a Nocturnal Council which is supposed to retain the mind of the legislator, and of which some of the members are even supposed to go abroad and inspect the institutions of foreign countries, as a foundation for changes in their own.</div><div class="sentence"> The spirit of such changes, though avoiding the extravagance of a popular assembly, being only so much change as the conservative temper of old members is likely to allow, is nevertheless inconsistent with the fixedness of Egypt which Plato wishes to impress upon Hellenic institutions.</div><div class="sentence"> He is inconsistent with himself as the truth begins to dawn upon him that 'in the execution things for the most part fall short of our conception of them' (Republic).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">050</span> <div class="sentence">  And is not this true of ideals of government in general?</div><div class="sentence"> We are always disappointed in them.</div><div class="sentence"> Nothing great can be accomplished in the short space of human life; wherefore also we look forward to another (Republic).</div><div class="sentence"> As we grow old, we are sensible that we have no power actively to pursue our ideals any longer.</div><div class="sentence"> We have had our opportunity and do not aspire to be more than men: we have received our 'wages and are going home.'</div><div class="sentence"> Neither do we despair of the future of mankind, because we have been able to do so little in comparison of the whole.</div><div class="sentence"> We look in vain for consistency either in men or things.</div><div class="sentence"> But we have seen enough of improvement in our own time to justify us in the belief that the world is worth working for and that a good man's life is not thrown away.</div><div class="sentence"> Such reflections may help us to bring home to ourselves by inward sympathy the language of Plato in the Laws, and to combine into something like a whole his various and at first sight inconsistent utterances.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span> <div class="sentence">  VI.</div><div class="sentence"> The Republic may be described as the Spartan constitution appended to a government of philosophers.</div><div class="sentence"> But in the Laws an Athenian element is also introduced.</div><div class="sentence"> Many enactments are taken from the Athenian; the four classes are borrowed from the constitution of Cleisthenes, which Plato regards as the best form of Athenian government, and the guardians of the law bear a certain resemblance to the archons.</div><div class="sentence"> In the constitution of the Laws nearly all officers are elected by a vote more or less popular and by lot.</div><div class="sentence"> But the assembly only exists for the purposes of election, and has no legislative or executive powers.</div><div class="sentence"> The Nocturnal Council, which is the highest body in the state, has several of the functions of the ancient Athenian Areopagus, after which it appears to be modelled.</div><div class="sentence"> Life is to wear, as at Athens, a joyous and festive look; there are to be Bacchic choruses, and men of mature age are encouraged in moderate potations.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, the common meals, the public education, the crypteia are borrowed from Sparta and not from Athens, and the superintendence of private life, which was to be practised by the governors, has also its prototype in Sparta.</div><div class="sentence"> The extravagant dislike which Plato shows both to a naval power and to extreme democracy is the reverse of Athenian.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span> <div class="sentence">  The best-governed Hellenic states traced the origin of their laws to individual lawgivers.</div><div class="sentence"> These were real persons, though we are uncertain how far they originated or only modified the institutions which are ascribed to them.</div><div class="sentence"> But the lawgiver, though not a myth, was a fixed idea in the mind of the Greek,—as fixed as the Trojan war or the earth-born Cadmus.</div><div class="sentence"> 'This was what Solon meant or said'—was the form in which the Athenian expressed his own conception of right and justice, or argued a disputed point of law.</div><div class="sentence"> And the constant reference in the Laws of Plato to the lawgiver is altogether in accordance with Greek modes of thinking and speaking.</div></div>

but if you ask what is the good of education in general, I answer, that education makes good men, and that good men act nobly and overcome their enemies in battle.</div><div class="sentence"> Victory is often suicidal to the victors, because it creates forgetfulness of education, but education itself is never suicidal.</div><div class="sentence"> 'You imply that the regulation of convivial meetings is a part of education; how will you prove this?'</div><div class="sentence"> I will tell you.</div><div class="sentence"> But first let me offer a word of apology.</div><div class="sentence"> We Athenians are always thought to be fond of talking, whereas the Lacedaemonian is celebrated for brevity, and the Cretan is considered to be sagacious and reserved.</div><div class="sentence"> Now I fear that I may be charged with spinning a long discourse out of slender materials.</div><div class="sentence"> For drinking cannot be rightly ordered without correct principles of music, and music runs up into education generally, and to discuss all these matters may be tedious;

the soldier must learn to ride, and the carpenter to measure and use the rule,—all the thoughts and pleasures of children should bear on their after-profession.—Do you agree with me?</div><div class="sentence"> 'Certainly.'</div><div class="sentence"> And we must remember further that we are speaking of the education, not of a trainer, or of the captain of a ship, but of a perfect citizen who knows how to rule and how to obey; and such an education aims at virtue, and not at wealth or strength or mere cleverness.</div><div class="sentence"> To the good man, education is of all things the most precious, and is also in constant need of renovation.</div><div class="sentence"> 'We agree.'</div><div class="sentence"> And we have before agreed that good men are those who are able to control themselves, and bad men are those who are not.</div><div class="sentence"> Let me offer you an illustration which will assist our argument.</div><div class="sentence"> Man is one; but in one and the same man are two foolish counsellors who contend within him—pleasure and pain, and of either he has expectations which we call hope and fear; and he is able to reason about good and evil, and reason, when affirmed by the state, becomes law.</div><div class="sentence"> 'We cannot follow you.'</div><div class="sentence"> Let me put the matter in another way: Every creature is a puppet of the Gods—whether he is a mere plaything or has any serious use we do not know;

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span> <div class="sentence">  BOOK II.</div><div class="sentence"> And are there any other uses of well-ordered potations?</div><div class="sentence"> There are; but in order to explain them, I must repeat what I mean by right education; which, if I am not mistaken, depends on the due regulation of convivial intercourse.</div><div class="sentence"> 'A high assumption.'</div><div class="sentence"> I believe that virtue and vice are originally present to the mind of children in the form of pleasure and pain; reason and fixed principles come later, and happy is he who acquires them even in declining years; for he who possesses them is the perfect man.</div><div class="sentence"> When pleasure and pain, and love and hate, are rightly implanted in the yet unconscious soul, and after the attainment of reason are discovered to be in harmony with her, this harmony of the soul is virtue, and the preparatory stage, anticipating reason, I call education.</div><div class="sentence"> But the finer sense of pleasure and pain is apt to be impaired in the course of life; and therefore the Gods, pitying the toils and sorrows of mortals, have allowed them to have holidays, and given them the Muses and Apollo and Dionysus for leaders and playfellows.</div><div class="sentence"> All young creatures love motion and frolic, and utter sounds of delight; but man only is capable of taking pleasure in rhythmical and harmonious movements.</div><div class="sentence"> With these education begins; and the uneducated is he who has never known the discipline of the chorus, and the educated is he who has.</div><div class="sentence"> The chorus is partly dance and partly song, and therefore the well-educated must sing and dance well.</div><div class="sentence"> But when we say, 'He sings and dances well,' we mean that he sings and dances what is good.</div><div class="sentence"> And if he thinks that to be good which is really good, he will have a much higher music and harmony in him, and be a far greater master of imitation in sound and gesture than he who is not of this opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> 'True.'</div><div class="sentence"> Then, if we know what is good and bad in song and dance, we shall know what education is?</div><div class="sentence"> 'Very true.'</div><div class="sentence"> Let us now consider the beauty of figure, melody, song, and dance.</div><div class="sentence"> Will the same figures or sounds be equally well adapted to the manly and the cowardly when they are in trouble?</div><div class="sentence"> 'How can they be, when the very colours of their faces are different?'</div><div class="sentence"> Figures and melodies have a rhythm and harmony which are adapted to the expression of different feelings (I may remark, by the way, that the term 'colour,' which is a favourite word of music-masters, is not really applicable to music).</div><div class="sentence"> And one class of harmonies is akin to courage and all virtue, the other to cowardice and all vice.</div><div class="sentence"> 'We agree.'</div><div class="sentence"> And do all men equally like all dances?</div><div class="sentence"> 'Far otherwise.'</div><div class="sentence"> Do some figures, then, appear to be beautiful which are not?</div><div class="sentence"> For no one will admit that the forms of vice are more beautiful than the forms of virtue, or that he prefers the first kind to the second.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet most persons say that the merit of music is to give pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> But this is impiety.</div><div class="sentence"> There is, however, a more plausible account of the matter given by others, who make their likes or dislikes the criterion of excellence.</div><div class="sentence"> Sometimes nature crosses habit, or conversely, and then they say that such and such fashions or gestures are pleasant, but they do not like to exhibit them before men of sense, although they enjoy them in private.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Very true.'</div><div class="sentence"> And do vicious measures and strains do any harm, or good measures any good to the lovers of them?</div><div class="sentence"> 'Probably.'</div><div class="sentence"> Say, rather 'Certainly': for the gentle indulgence which we often show to vicious men inevitably makes us become like them.</div><div class="sentence"> And what can be worse than this?</div><div class="sentence"> 'Nothing.'</div><div class="sentence"> Then in a well-administered city, the poet will not be allowed to make the songs of the people just as he pleases, or to train his choruses without regard to virtue and vice.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Certainly not.'</div><div class="sentence"> And yet he may do this anywhere except in Egypt; for there ages ago they discovered the great truth which I am now asserting, that the young should be educated in forms and strains of virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> These they fixed and consecrated in their temples; and no artist or musician is allowed to deviate from them.</div><div class="sentence"> They are literally the same which they were ten thousand years ago.</div><div class="sentence"> And this practice of theirs suggests the reflection that legislation about music is not an impossible thing.</div><div class="sentence"> But the particular enactments must be the work of God or of some God-inspired man, as in Egypt their ancient chants are said to be the composition of the goddess Isis.</div><div class="sentence"> The melodies which have a natural truth and correctness should be embodied in a law, and then the desire of novelty is not strong enough to change the old fashions.</div><div class="sentence"> Is not the origin of music as follows?</div><div class="sentence"> We rejoice when we think that we prosper, and we think that we prosper when we rejoice, and at such times we cannot rest, but our young men dance dances and sing songs, and our old men, who have lost the elasticity of youth, regale themselves with the memory of the past, while they contemplate the life and activity of the young.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Most true.'</div><div class="sentence"> People say that he who gives us most pleasure at such festivals is to win the palm: are they right?</div><div class="sentence"> 'Possibly.'</div><div class="sentence"> Let us not be hasty in deciding, but first imagine a festival at which the lord of the festival, having assembled the citizens, makes a proclamation that he shall be crowned victor who gives the most pleasure, from whatever source derived.</div><div class="sentence"> We will further suppose that there are exhibitions of rhapsodists and musicians, tragic and comic poets, and even marionette-players—which of the pleasure-makers will win?</div><div class="sentence"> Shall I answer for you?—the marionette-players will please the children; youths will decide for comedy; young men, educated women, and people in general will prefer tragedy; we old men are lovers of Homer and Hesiod.</div><div class="sentence"> Now which of them is right?</div><div class="sentence"> If you and I are asked, we shall certainly say that the old men's way of thinking ought to prevail.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Very true.'</div><div class="sentence"> So far I agree with the many that the excellence of music is to be measured by pleasure; but then the pleasure must be that of the good and educated, or better still, of one supremely virtuous and educated man.</div><div class="sentence"> The true judge must have both wisdom and courage.</div><div class="sentence"> For he must lead the multitude and not be led by them, and must not weakly yield to the uproar of the theatre, nor give false judgment out of that mouth which has just appealed to the Gods.</div><div class="sentence"> The ancient custom of Hellas, which still prevails in Italy and Sicily, left the judgment to the spectators, but this custom has been the ruin of the poets, who seek only to please their patrons, and has degraded the audience by the representation of inferior characters.</div><div class="sentence"> What is the inference?</div><div class="sentence"> The same which we have often drawn, that education is the training of the young idea in what the law affirms and the elders approve.</div><div class="sentence"> And as the soul of a child is too young to be trained in earnest, a kind of education has been invented which tempts him with plays and songs, as the sick are tempted by pleasant meats and drinks.</div><div class="sentence"> And the wise legislator will compel the poet to express in his poems noble thoughts in fitting words and rhythms.</div><div class="sentence"> 'But is this the practice elsewhere than in Crete and Lacedaemon?</div><div class="sentence"> In other states, as far as I know, dances and music are constantly changed at the pleasure of the hearers.'</div><div class="sentence"> I am afraid that I misled you; not liking to be always finding fault with mankind as they are, I described them as they ought to be.</div><div class="sentence"> But let me understand: you say that such customs exist among the Cretans and Lacedaemonians, and that the rest of the world would be improved by adopting them?</div><div class="sentence"> 'Much improved.'</div><div class="sentence"> And you compel your poets to declare that the righteous are happy, and that the wicked man, even if he be as rich as Midas, is unhappy?</div><div class="sentence"> Or, in the words of Tyrtaeus, 'I sing not, I care not about him' who is a great warrior not having justice; if he be unjust, 'I would not have him look calmly upon death or be swifter than the wind'; and may he be deprived of every good—that is, of every true good.</div><div class="sentence"> For even if he have the goods which men regard, these are not really goods: first health; beauty next; thirdly wealth; and there are others.</div><div class="sentence"> A man may have every sense purged and improved; he may be a tyrant, and do what he likes, and live for ever: but you and I will maintain that all these things are goods to the just, but to the unjust the greatest of evils, if life be immortal; not so great if he live for a short time only.</div><div class="sentence"> If a man had health and wealth, and power, and was insolent and unjust, his life would still be miserable; he might be fair and rich, and do what he liked, but he would live basely, and if basely evilly, and if evilly painfully.</div><div class="sentence"> 'There I cannot agree with you.'</div><div class="sentence"> Then may heaven give us the spirit of agreement, for I am as convinced of the truth of what I say as that Crete is an island; and, if I were a lawgiver, I would exercise a censorship over the poets, and I would punish them if they said that the wicked are happy, or that injustice is profitable.</div><div class="sentence"> And these are not the only matters in which I should make my citizens talk in a different way to the world in general.</div><div class="sentence"> If I asked Zeus and Apollo, the divine legislators of Crete and Sparta,—'Are the just and pleasant life the same or not the same'?—and they replied,—'Not the same'; and I asked again—'Which is the happier'?</div><div class="sentence"> And they said'—'The pleasant life,' this is an answer not fit for a God to utter, and therefore I ought rather to put the same question to some legislator.</div><div class="sentence"> And if he replies 'The pleasant,' then I should say to him, 'O my father, did you not tell me that I should live as justly as possible'?</div><div class="sentence"> and if to be just is to be happy, what is that principle of happiness or good which is superior to pleasure?</div><div class="sentence"> Is the approval of gods and men to be deemed good and honourable, but unpleasant, and their disapproval the reverse?</div><div class="sentence"> Or is the neither doing nor suffering evil good and honourable, although not pleasant?</div><div class="sentence"> But you cannot make men like what is not pleasant, and therefore you must make them believe that the just is pleasant.</div><div class="sentence"> The business of the legislator is to clear up this confusion.</div><div class="sentence"> He will show that the just and the unjust are identical with the pleasurable and the painful, from the point of view of the just man, of the unjust the reverse.</div><div class="sentence"> And which is the truer judgment?</div><div class="sentence"> Surely that of the better soul.</div><div class="sentence"> For if not the truth, it is the best and most moral of fictions; and the legislator who desires to propagate this useful lie, may be encouraged by remarking that mankind have believed the story of Cadmus and the dragon's teeth, and therefore he may be assured that he can make them believe anything, and need only consider what fiction will do the greatest good.</div><div class="sentence"> That the happiest is also the holiest, this shall be our strain, which shall be sung by all three choruses alike.</div><div class="sentence"> First will enter the choir of children, who will lift up their voices on high; and after them the young men, who will pray the God Paean to be gracious to the youth, and to testify to the truth of their words; then will come the chorus of elder men, between thirty and sixty; and, lastly, there will be the old men, and they will tell stories enforcing the same virtues, as with the voice of an oracle.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Whom do you mean by the third chorus?'</div><div class="sentence"> You remember how I spoke at first of the restless nature of young creatures, who jumped about and called out in a disorderly manner, and I said that no other animal attained any perception of rhythm; but that to us the Gods gave Apollo and the Muses and Dionysus to be our playfellows.</div><div class="sentence"> Of the two first choruses I have already spoken, and I have now to speak of the third, or Dionysian chorus, which is composed of those who are between thirty and sixty years old.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Let us hear.'</div><div class="sentence"> We are agreed (are we not?)</div><div class="sentence"> that men, women, and children should be always charming themselves with strains of virtue, and that there should be a variety in the strains, that they may not weary of them?</div><div class="sentence"> Now the fairest and most useful of strains will be uttered by the elder men, and therefore we cannot let them off.</div><div class="sentence"> But how can we make them sing?</div><div class="sentence"> For a discreet elderly man is ashamed to hear the sound of his own voice in private, and still more in public.</div><div class="sentence"> The only way is to give them drink;

and let the tyrant be young, mindful, teachable, courageous, magnanimous; and let him have the inseparable condition of all virtue, which is temperance—not prudence, but that natural temperance which is the gift of children and animals, and is hardly reckoned among goods—with this he must be endowed, if the state is to acquire the form most conducive to happiness in the speediest manner.</div><div class="sentence"> And I must add one other condition: the tyrant must be fortunate, and his good fortune must consist in his having the co-operation of a great legislator.</div><div class="sentence"> When God has done all this, He has done the best which He can for a state; not so well if He has given them two legislators instead of one, and less and less well if He has given them a great many.</div><div class="sentence"> An orderly tyranny most easily passes into the perfect state;

whereas a state, if an 'ocracy' at all, should be called a theocracy.</div><div class="sentence"> A tale of old will explain my meaning.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a tradition of a golden age, in which all things were spontaneous and abundant.</div><div class="sentence"> Cronos, then lord of the world, knew that no mortal nature could endure the temptations of power, and therefore he appointed demons or demi-gods, who are of a superior race, to have dominion over man, as man has dominion over the animals.</div><div class="sentence"> They took care of us with great ease and pleasure to themselves, and no less to us; and the tradition says that only when God, and not man, is the ruler, can the human race cease from ill.</div><div class="sentence"> This was the manner of life which prevailed under Cronos, and which we must strive to follow so far as the principle of immortality still abides in us and we live according to law and the dictates of right reason.</div><div class="sentence"> But in an oligarchy or democracy, when the governing principle is athirst for pleasure, the laws are trampled under foot, and there is no possibility of salvation.</div><div class="sentence"> Is it not often said that there are as many forms of laws as there are governments, and that they have no concern either with any one virtue or with all virtue, but are relative to the will of the government?</div><div class="sentence"> Which is as much as to say that 'might makes right.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'What do you mean?'</div><div class="sentence"> I mean that governments enact their own laws, and that every government makes self-preservation its principal aim.</div><div class="sentence"> He who transgresses the laws is regarded as an evil-doer, and punished accordingly.</div><div class="sentence"> This was one of the unjust principles of government which we mentioned when speaking of the different claims to rule.</div><div class="sentence"> We were agreed that parents should rule their children, the elder the younger, the noble the ignoble.</div><div class="sentence"> But there were also several other principles, and among them Pindar's 'law of violence.'</div><div class="sentence"> To whom then is our state to be entrusted?</div><div class="sentence"> For many a government is only a victorious faction which has a monopoly of power, and refuses any share to the conquered, lest when they get into office they should remember their wrongs.</div><div class="sentence"> Such governments are not polities, but parties; nor are any laws good which are made in the interest of particular classes only, and not of the whole.</div><div class="sentence"> And in our state I mean to protest against making any man a ruler because he is rich, or strong, or noble.</div><div class="sentence"> But those who are obedient to the laws, and who win the victory of obedience, shall be promoted to the service of the Gods according to the degree of their obedience.</div><div class="sentence"> When I call the ruler the servant or minister of the law, this is not a mere paradox, but I mean to say that upon a willingness to obey the law the existence of the state depends.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Truly, Stranger, you have a keen vision.'</div><div class="sentence"> Why, yes; every man when he is old has his intellectual vision most keen.</div><div class="sentence"> And now shall we call in our colonists and make a speech to them?</div><div class="sentence"> Friends, we say to them, God holds in His hand the beginning, middle, and end of all things, and He moves in a straight line towards the accomplishment of His will.</div><div class="sentence"> Justice always bears Him company, and punishes those who fall short of His laws.</div><div class="sentence"> He who would be happy follows humbly in her train; but he who is lifted up with pride, or wealth, or honour, or beauty, is soon deserted by God, and, being deserted, he lives in confusion and disorder.</div><div class="sentence"> To many he seems a great man;

but the bad man has a polluted soul; and therefore his service is wasted upon the Gods, while the good are accepted of them.</div><div class="sentence"> I have told you the mark at which we ought to aim.</div><div class="sentence"> You will say, How, and with what weapons?</div><div class="sentence"> In the first place we affirm, that after the Olympian Gods and the Gods of the state, honour should be given to the Gods below, and to them should be offered everything in even numbers and of the second choice; the auspicious odd numbers and everything of the first choice are reserved for the Gods above.</div><div class="sentence"> Next demi-gods or spirits must be honoured, and then heroes, and after them family gods, who will be worshipped at their local seats according to law.</div><div class="sentence"> Further, the honour due to parents should not be forgotten; children owe all that they have to them, and the debt must be repaid by kindness and attention in old age.</div><div class="sentence"> No unbecoming word must be uttered before them; for there is an avenging angel who hears them when they are angry, and the child should consider that the parent when he has been wronged has a right to be angry.</div><div class="sentence"> After their death let them have a moderate funeral, such as their fathers have had before them; and there shall be an annual commemoration of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Living on this wise, we shall be accepted of the Gods, and shall pass our days in good hope.</div><div class="sentence"> The law will determine all our various duties towards relatives and friends and other citizens, and the whole state will be happy and prosperous.</div><div class="sentence"> But if the legislator would persuade as well as command, he will add prefaces to his laws which will predispose the citizens to virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> Even a little accomplished in the way of gaining the hearts of men is of great value.</div><div class="sentence"> For most men are in no particular haste to become good.</div><div class="sentence"> As Hesiod says:</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span> <div class="sentence">  The first word of the Laws somewhat abruptly introduces the thought which is present to the mind of Plato throughout the work, namely, that Law is of divine origin.</div><div class="sentence"> In the words of a great English writer—'Her seat is the bosom of God, her voice the harmony of the world.'</div><div class="sentence"> Though the particular laws of Sparta and Crete had a narrow and imperfect aim, this is not true of divine laws, which are based upon the principles of human nature, and not framed to meet the exigencies of the moment.</div><div class="sentence"> They have their natural divisions, too, answering to the kinds of virtue; very unlike the discordant enactments of an Athenian assembly or of an English Parliament.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet we may observe two inconsistencies in Plato's treatment of the subject: first, a lesser, inasmuch as he does not clearly distinguish the Cretan and Spartan laws, of which the exclusive aim is war, from those other laws of Zeus and Apollo which are said to be divine, and to comprehend all virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> Secondly, we may retort on him his own complaint against Sparta and Crete, that he has himself given us a code of laws, which for the most part have a military character; and that we cannot point to 'obvious examples of similar institutions which are concerned with pleasure;' at least there is only one such, that which relates to the regulation of convivial intercourse.</div><div class="sentence"> The military spirit which is condemned by him in the beginning of the Laws, reappears in the seventh and eighth books.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">082</span> <div class="sentence">  There are other subjects on which Plato breaks ground, as his manner is, early in the work.</div><div class="sentence"> First, he gives a sketch of the subject of laws; they are to comprehend the whole of human life, from infancy to age, and from birth to death, although the proposed plan is far from being regularly executed in the books which follow, partly owing to the necessity of describing the constitution as well as the laws of his new colony.</div><div class="sentence"> Secondly, he touches on the power of music, which may exercise so great an influence on the character of men for good or evil; he refers especially to the great offence—which he mentions again, and which he had condemned in the Republic—of varying the modes and rhythms, as well as to that of separating the words from the music.</div><div class="sentence"> Thirdly, he reprobates the prevalence of unnatural loves in Sparta and Crete, which he attributes to the practice of syssitia and gymnastic exercises, and considers to be almost inseparable from them.</div><div class="sentence"> To this subject he again returns in the eighth book.</div><div class="sentence"> Fourthly, the virtues are affirmed to be inseparable from one another, even if not absolutely one; this, too, is a principle which he reasserts at the conclusion of the work.</div><div class="sentence"> As in the beginnings of Plato's other writings, we have here several 'notes' struck, which form the preludes of longer discussions, although the hint is less ingeniously given, and the promise more imperfectly fulfilled than in the earlier dialogues.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">083</span> <div class="sentence">  The distinction between ethics and politics has not yet dawned upon Plato's mind.</div><div class="sentence"> To him, law is still floating in a region between the two.</div><div class="sentence"> He would have desired that all the acts and laws of a state should have regard to all virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> But he did not see that politics and law are subject to their own conditions, and are distinguished from ethics by natural differences.</div><div class="sentence"> The actions of which politics take cognisance are necessarily collective or representative; and law is limited to external acts which affect others as well as the agents.</div><div class="sentence"> Ethics, on the other hand, include the whole duty of man in relation both to himself and others.</div><div class="sentence"> But Plato has never reflected on these differences.</div><div class="sentence"> He fancies that the life of the state can be as easily fashioned as that of the individual.</div><div class="sentence"> He is favourable to a balance of power, but never seems to have considered that power might be so balanced as to produce an absolute immobility in the state.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor is he alive to the evils of confounding vice and crime; or to the necessity of governments abstaining from excessive interference with their subjects.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">084</span> <div class="sentence">  Yet this confusion of ethics and politics has also a better and a truer side.</div><div class="sentence"> If unable to grasp some important distinctions, Plato is at any rate seeking to elevate the lower to the higher; he does not pull down the principles of men to their practice, or narrow the conception of the state to the immediate necessities of politics.</div><div class="sentence"> Political ideals of freedom and equality, of a divine government which has been or will be in some other age or country, have greatly tended to educate and ennoble the human race.</div><div class="sentence"> And if not the first author of such ideals (for they are as old as Hesiod), Plato has done more than any other writer to impress them on the world.</div><div class="sentence"> To those who censure his idealism we may reply in his own words—'He is not the worse painter who draws a perfectly beautiful figure, because no such figure of a man could ever have existed' (Republic).</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">088</span> <div class="sentence">  Plato's denial of wine to the young and his approval of it for their elders has some points of view which may be illustrated by the temperance controversy of our own times.</div><div class="sentence"> Wine may be allowed to have a religious as well as a festive use; it is commended both in the Old and New Testament; it has been sung of by nearly all poets; and it may be truly said to have a healing influence both on body and mind.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet it is also very liable to excess and abuse, and for this reason is prohibited by Mahometans, as well as of late years by many Christians, no less than by the ancient Spartans; and to sound its praises seriously seems to partake of the nature of a paradox.</div><div class="sentence"> But we may rejoin with Plato that the abuse of a good thing does not take away the use of it.</div><div class="sentence"> Total abstinence, as we often say, is not the best rule, but moderate indulgence; and it is probably true that a temperate use of wine may contribute some elements of character to social life which we can ill afford to lose.</div><div class="sentence"> It draws men out of their reserve; it helps them to forget themselves and to appear as they by nature are when not on their guard, and therefore to make them more human and greater friends to their fellow-men.</div><div class="sentence"> It gives them a new experience; it teaches them to combine self-control with a measure of indulgence; it may sometimes restore to them the simplicity of childhood.</div><div class="sentence"> We entirely agree with Plato in forbidding the use of wine to the young; but when we are of mature age there are occasions on which we derive refreshment and strength from moderate potations.</div><div class="sentence"> It is well to make abstinence the rule, but the rule may sometimes admit of an exception.</div><div class="sentence"> We are in a higher, as well as in a lower sense, the better for the use of wine.</div><div class="sentence"> The question runs up into wider ones—What is the general effect of asceticism on human nature?</div><div class="sentence"> and, Must there not be a certain proportion between the aspirations of man and his powers?—questions which have been often discussed both by ancient and modern philosophers.</div><div class="sentence"> So by comparing things old and new we may sometimes help to realize to ourselves the meaning of Plato in the altered circumstances of our own life.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span> <div class="sentence">  Like the importance which he attaches to festive entertainments, his depreciation of courage to the fourth place in the scale of virtue appears to be somewhat rhetorical and exaggerated.</div><div class="sentence"> But he is speaking of courage in the lower sense of the term, not as including loyalty or temperance.</div><div class="sentence"> He does not insist in this passage, as in the Protagoras, on the unity of the virtues; or, as in the Laches, on the identity of wisdom and courage.</div><div class="sentence"> But he says that they all depend upon their leader mind, and that, out of the union of wisdom and temperance with courage, springs justice.</div><div class="sentence"> Elsewhere he is disposed to regard temperance rather as a condition of all virtue than as a particular virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> He generalizes temperance, as in the Republic he generalizes justice.</div><div class="sentence"> The nature of the virtues is to run up into one another, and in many passages Plato makes but a faint effort to distinguish them.</div><div class="sentence"> He still quotes the poets, somewhat enlarging, as his manner is, or playing with their meaning.</div><div class="sentence"> The martial poet Tyrtaeus, and the oligarch Theognis, furnish him with happy illustrations of the two sorts of courage.</div><div class="sentence"> The fear of fear, the division of goods into human and divine, the acknowledgment that peace and reconciliation are better than the appeal to the sword, the analysis of temperance into resistance of pleasure as well as endurance of pain, the distinction between the education which is suitable for a trade or profession, and for the whole of life, are important and probably new ethical conceptions.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor has Plato forgotten his old paradox (Gorgias) that to be punished is better than to be unpunished, when he says, that to the bad man death is the only mitigation of his evil.</div><div class="sentence"> He is not less ideal in many passages of the Laws than in the Gorgias or Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> But his wings are heavy, and he is unequal to any sustained flight.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span> <div class="sentence">  There is more attempt at dramatic effect in the first book than in the later parts of the work.</div><div class="sentence"> The outburst of martial spirit in the Lacedaemonian, 'O best of men'; the protest which the Cretan makes against the supposed insult to his lawgiver; the cordial acknowledgment on the part of both of them that laws should not be discussed publicly by those who live under their rule; the difficulty which they alike experience in following the speculations of the Athenian, are highly characteristic.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span> <div class="sentence">  In the second book, Plato pursues further his notion of educating by a right use of pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> He begins by conceiving an endless power of youthful life, which is to be reduced to rule and measure by harmony and rhythm.</div><div class="sentence"> Men differ from the lower animals in that they are capable of musical discipline.</div><div class="sentence"> But music, like all art, must be truly imitative, and imitative of what is true and good.</div><div class="sentence"> Art and morality agree in rejecting pleasure as the criterion of good.</div><div class="sentence"> True art is inseparable from the highest and most ennobling ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato only recognizes the identity of pleasure and good when the pleasure is of the higher kind.</div><div class="sentence"> He is the enemy of 'songs without words,' which he supposes to have some confusing or enervating effect on the mind of the hearer; and he is also opposed to the modern degeneracy of the drama, which he would probably have illustrated, like Aristophanes, from Euripides and Agathon.</div><div class="sentence"> From this passage may be gathered a more perfect conception of art than from any other of Plato's writings.</div><div class="sentence"> He understands that art is at once imitative and ideal, an exact representation of truth, and also a representation of the highest truth.</div><div class="sentence"> The same double view of art may be gathered from a comparison of the third and tenth books of the Republic, but is here more clearly and pointedly expressed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span> <div class="sentence">  We are inclined to suspect that both here and in the Republic Plato exaggerates the influence really exercised by the song and the dance.</div><div class="sentence"> But we must remember also the susceptible nature of the Greek, and the perfection to which these arts were carried by him.</div><div class="sentence"> Further, the music had a sacred and Pythagorean character; the dance too was part of a religious festival.</div><div class="sentence"> And only at such festivals the sexes mingled in public, and the youths passed under the eyes of their elders.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">093</span> <div class="sentence">  At the beginning of the third book, Plato abruptly asks the question, What is the origin of states?</div><div class="sentence"> The answer is, Infinite time.</div><div class="sentence"> We have already seen—in the Theaetetus, where he supposes that in the course of ages every man has had numberless progenitors, kings and slaves, Greeks and barbarians; and in the Critias, where he says that nine thousand years have elapsed since the island of Atlantis fought with Athens—that Plato is no stranger to the conception of long periods of time.</div><div class="sentence"> He imagines human society to have been interrupted by natural convulsions; and beginning from the last of these, he traces the steps by which the family has grown into the state, and the original scattered society, becoming more and more civilised, has finally passed into military organizations like those of Crete and Sparta.</div><div class="sentence"> His conception of the origin of states is far truer in the Laws than in the Republic; but it must be remembered that here he is giving an historical, there an ideal picture of the growth of society.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span> <div class="sentence">  Modern enquirers, like Plato, have found in infinite ages the explanation not only of states, but of languages, men, animals, the world itself; like him, also, they have detected in later institutions the vestiges of a patriarchal state still surviving.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus far Plato speaks as 'the spectator of all time and all existence,' who may be thought by some divine instinct to have guessed at truths which were hereafter to be revealed.</div><div class="sentence"> He is far above the vulgar notion that Hellas is the civilized world (Statesman), or that civilization only began when the Hellenes appeared on the scene.</div><div class="sentence"> But he has no special knowledge of 'the days before the flood'; and when he approaches more historical times, in preparing the way for his own theory of mixed government, he argues partially and erroneously.</div><div class="sentence"> He is desirous of showing that unlimited power is ruinous to any state, and hence he is led to attribute a tyrannical spirit to the first Dorian kings.</div><div class="sentence"> The decay of Argos and the destruction of Messene are adduced by him as a manifest proof of their failure; and Sparta, he thinks, was only preserved by the limitations which the wisdom of successive legislators introduced into the government.</div><div class="sentence"> But there is no more reason to suppose that the Dorian rule of life which was followed at Sparta ever prevailed in Argos and Messene, than to assume that Dorian institutions were framed to protect the Greeks against the power of Assyria; or that the empire of Assyria was in any way affected by the Trojan war; or that the return of the Heraclidae was only the return of Achaean exiles, who received a new name from their leader Dorieus.</div><div class="sentence"> Such fancies were chiefly based, as far as they had any foundation, on the use of analogy, which played a great part in the dawn of historical and geographical research.</div><div class="sentence"> Because there was a Persian empire which was the natural enemy of the Greek, there must also have been an Assyrian empire, which had a similar hostility; and not only the fable of the island of Atlantis, but the Trojan war, in Plato's mind derived some features from the Persian struggle.</div><div class="sentence"> So Herodotus makes the Nile answer to the Ister, and the valley of the Nile to the Red Sea.</div><div class="sentence"> In the Republic, Plato is flying in the air regardless of fact and possibility—in the Laws, he is making history by analogy.</div><div class="sentence"> In the former, he appears to be like some modern philosophers, absolutely devoid of historical sense; in the latter, he is on a level, not with Thucydides, or the critical historians of Greece, but with Herodotus, or even with Ctesias.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span> <div class="sentence">  The chief object of Plato in tracing the origin of society is to show the point at which regular government superseded the patriarchical authority, and the separate customs of different families were systematized by legislators, and took the form of laws consented to by them all.</div><div class="sentence"> According to Plato, the only sound principle on which any government could be based was a mixture or balance of power.</div><div class="sentence"> The balance of power saved Sparta, when the two other Heraclid states fell into disorder.</div><div class="sentence"> Here is probably the first trace of a political idea, which has exercised a vast influence both in ancient and modern times.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet we might fairly ask, a little parodying the language of Plato—O legislator, is unanimity only 'the struggle for existence'; or is the balance of powers in a state better than the harmony of them?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span> <div class="sentence">  In these quaint forms of thought and language, great principles of morals and legislation are enunciated by him for the first time.</div><div class="sentence"> They all go back to mind and God, who holds the beginning, middle, and end of all things in His hand.</div><div class="sentence"> The adjustment of the divine and human elements in the world is conceived in the spirit of modern popular philosophy, differing not much in the mode of expression.</div><div class="sentence"> At first sight the legislator appears to be impotent, for all things are the sport of chance.</div><div class="sentence"> But we admit also that God governs all things, and that chance and opportunity co-operate with Him (compare the saying, that chance is the name of the unknown cause).</div><div class="sentence"> Lastly, while we acknowledge that God and chance govern mankind and provide the conditions of human action, experience will not allow us to deny a place to art.</div><div class="sentence"> We know that there is a use in having a pilot, though the storm may overwhelm him; and a legislator is required to provide for the happiness of a state, although he will pray for favourable conditions under which he may exercise his art.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">271</span> <div class="sentence">  Plato has an evident dislike of the Athenian dicasteries; he prefers a few judges who take a leading part in the conduct of trials to a great number who only listen in silence.</div><div class="sentence"> He allows of two appeals—in each case however with an increase of the penalty.</div><div class="sentence"> Modern jurists would disapprove of the redress of injustice being purchased only at an increasing risk; though indirectly the burden of legal expenses, which seems to have been little felt among the Athenians, has a similar effect.</div><div class="sentence"> The love of litigation, which is a remnant of barbarism quite as much as a corruption of civilization, and was innate in the Athenian people, is diminished in the new state by the imposition of severe penalties.</div><div class="sentence"> If persevered in, it is to be punished with death.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">272</span> <div class="sentence">  In the Laws murder and homicide besides being crimes, are also pollutions.</div><div class="sentence"> Regarded from this point of view, the estimate of such offences is apt to depend on accidental circumstances, such as the shedding of blood, and not on the real guilt of the offender or the injury done to society.</div><div class="sentence"> They are measured by the horror which they arouse in a barbarous age.</div><div class="sentence"> For there is a superstition in law as well as in religion, and the feelings of a primitive age have a traditional hold on the mass of the people.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, Plato is innocent of the barbarity which would visit the sins of the fathers upon the children, and he is quite aware that punishment has an eye to the future, and not to the past.</div><div class="sentence"> Compared with that of most European nations in the last century his penal code, though sometimes capricious, is reasonable and humane.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">273</span> <div class="sentence">  A defect in Plato's criminal jurisprudence is his remission of the punishment when the homicide has obtained the forgiveness of the murdered person; as if crime were a personal affair between individuals, and not an offence against the State.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a ridiculous disproportion in his punishments.</div><div class="sentence"> Because a slave may fairly receive a blow for stealing one fig or one bunch of grapes, or a tradesman for selling adulterated goods to the value of one drachma, it is rather hard upon the slave that he should receive as many blows as he has taken grapes or figs, or upon the tradesman who has sold adulterated goods to the value of a thousand drachmas that he should receive a thousand blows.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">274</span> <div class="sentence">  II.</div><div class="sentence"> But before punishment can be inflicted at all, the legislator must determine the nature of the voluntary and involuntary.</div><div class="sentence"> The great question of the freedom of the will, which in modern times has been worn threadbare with purely abstract discussion, was approached both by Plato and Aristotle—first, from the judicial; secondly, from the sophistical point of view.</div><div class="sentence"> They were puzzled by the degrees and kinds of crime; they observed also that the law only punished hurts which are inflicted by a voluntary agent on an involuntary patient.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">275</span> <div class="sentence">  In attempting to distinguish between hurt and injury, Plato says that mere hurt is not injury; but that a benefit when done in a wrong spirit may sometimes injure, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> when conferred without regard to right and wrong, or to the good or evil consequences which may follow.</div><div class="sentence"> He means to say that the good or evil disposition of the agent is the principle which characterizes actions; and this is not sufficiently described by the terms voluntary and involuntary.</div><div class="sentence"> You may hurt another involuntarily, and no one would suppose that you had injured him; and you may hurt him voluntarily, as in inflicting punishment—neither is this injury; but if you hurt him from motives of avarice, ambition, or cowardly fear, this is injury.</div><div class="sentence"> Injustice is also described as the victory of desire or passion or self-conceit over reason, as justice is the subordination of them to reason.</div><div class="sentence"> In some paradoxical sense Plato is disposed to affirm all injustice to be involuntary; because no man would do injustice who knew that it never paid and could calculate the consequences of what he was doing.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet, on the other hand, he admits that the distinction of voluntary and involuntary, taken in another and more obvious sense, is the basis of legislation.</div><div class="sentence"> His conception of justice and injustice is complicated (1) by the want of a distinction between justice and virtue, that is to say, between the quality which primarily regards others, and the quality in which self and others are equally regarded; (2) by the confusion of doing and suffering justice; (3) by the unwillingness to renounce the old Socratic paradox, that evil is involuntary.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">276</span> <div class="sentence">  III.</div><div class="sentence"> The Laws rest on a religious foundation; in this respect they bear the stamp of primitive legislation.</div><div class="sentence"> They do not escape the almost inevitable consequence of making irreligion penal.</div><div class="sentence"> If laws are based upon religion, the greatest offence against them must be irreligion.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence the necessity for what in modern language, and according to a distinction which Plato would scarcely have understood, might be termed persecution.</div><div class="sentence"> But the spirit of persecution in Plato, unlike that of modern religious bodies, arises out of the desire to enforce a true and simple form of religion, and is directed against the superstitions which tend to degrade mankind.</div><div class="sentence"> Sir Thomas More, in his Utopia, is in favour of tolerating all except the intolerant, though he would not promote to high offices those who disbelieved in the immortality of the soul.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato has not advanced quite so far as this in the path of toleration.</div><div class="sentence"> But in judging of his enlightenment, we must remember that the evils of necromancy and divination were far greater than those of intolerance in the ancient world.</div><div class="sentence"> Human nature is always having recourse to the first; but only when organized into some form of priesthood falls into the other; although in primitive as in later ages the institution of a priesthood may claim probably to be an advance on some form of religion which preceded.</div><div class="sentence"> The Laws would have rested on a sounder foundation, if Plato had ever distinctly realized to his mind the difference between crime and sin or vice.</div><div class="sentence"> Of this, as of many other controversies, a clear definition might have been the end.</div><div class="sentence"> But such a definition belongs to a later age of philosophy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">277</span> <div class="sentence">  The arguments which Plato uses for the being of a God, have an extremely modern character: first, the consensus gentium; secondly, the argument which has already been adduced in the Phaedrus, of the priority of the self-moved.</div><div class="sentence"> The answer to those who say that God 'cares not,' is, that He governs by general laws; and that he who takes care of the great will assuredly take care of the small.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato did not feel, and has not attempted to consider, the difficulty of reconciling the special with the general providence of God.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet he is on the road to a solution, when he regards the world as a whole, of which all the parts work together towards the final end.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">281</span> <div class="sentence">  The Tenth Book of the Laws presents a picture of the state of belief among the Greeks singularly like that of the world in which we live.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato is disposed to attribute the incredulity of his own age to several causes.</div><div class="sentence"> First, to the bad effect of mythological tales, of which he retains his disapproval; but he has a weak side for antiquity, and is unwilling, as in the Republic, wholly to proscribe them.</div><div class="sentence"> Secondly, he remarks the self-conceit of a newly-fledged generation of philosophers, who declare that the sun, moon, and stars, are earth and stones only; and who also maintain that the Gods are made by the laws of the state.</div><div class="sentence"> Thirdly, he notes a confusion in the minds of men arising out of their misinterpretation of the appearances of the world around them: they do not always see the righteous rewarded and the wicked punished.</div><div class="sentence"> So in modern times there are some whose infidelity has arisen from doubts about the inspiration of ancient writings; others who have been made unbelievers by physical science, or again by the seemingly political character of religion; while there is a third class to whose minds the difficulty of 'justifying the ways of God to man' has been the chief stumblingblock.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato is very much out of temper at the impiety of some of his contemporaries; yet he is determined to reason with the victims, as he regards them, of these illusions before he punishes them.</div><div class="sentence"> His answer to the unbelievers is twofold: first, that the soul is prior to the body; secondly, that the ruler of the universe being perfect has made all things with a view to their perfection.</div><div class="sentence"> The difficulties arising out of ancient sacred writings were far less serious in the age of Plato than in our own.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">282</span> <div class="sentence">  We too have our popular Epicureanism, which would allow the world to go on as if there were no God.</div><div class="sentence"> When the belief in Him, whether of ancient or modern times, begins to fade away, men relegate Him, either in theory or practice, into a distant heaven.</div><div class="sentence"> They do not like expressly to deny God when it is more convenient to forget Him; and so the theory of the Epicurean becomes the practice of mankind in general.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor can we be said to be free from that which Plato justly considers to be the worst unbelief—of those who put superstition in the place of true religion.</div><div class="sentence"> For the larger half of Christians continue to assert that the justice of God may be turned aside by gifts, and, if not by the 'odour of fat, and the sacrifice steaming to heaven,' still by another kind of sacrifice placed upon the altar—by masses for the quick and dead, by dispensations, by building churches, by rites and ceremonies—by the same means which the heathen used, taking other names and shapes.</div><div class="sentence"> And the indifference of Epicureanism and unbelief is in two ways the parent of superstition, partly because it permits, and also because it creates, a necessity for its development in religious and enthusiastic temperaments.</div><div class="sentence"> If men cannot have a rational belief, they will have an irrational.</div><div class="sentence"> And hence the most superstitious countries are also at a certain point of civilization the most unbelieving, and the revolution which takes one direction is quickly followed by a reaction in the other.</div><div class="sentence"> So we may read 'between the lines' ancient history and philosophy into modern, and modern into ancient.</div><div class="sentence"> Whether we compare the theory of Greek philosophy with the Christian religion, or the practice of the Gentile world with the practice of the Christian world, they will be found to differ more in words and less in reality than we might have supposed.</div><div class="sentence"> The greater opposition which is sometimes made between them seems to arise chiefly out of a comparison of the ideal of the one with the practice of the other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">283</span> <div class="sentence">  To the errors of superstition and unbelief Plato opposes the simple and natural truth of religion; the best and highest, whether conceived in the form of a person or a principle—as the divine mind or as the idea of good—is believed by him to be the basis of human life.</div><div class="sentence"> That all things are working together for good to the good and evil to the evil in this or in some other world to which human actions are transferred, is the sum of his faith or theology.</div><div class="sentence"> Unlike Socrates, he is absolutely free from superstition.</div><div class="sentence"> Religion and morality are one and indivisible to him.</div><div class="sentence"> He dislikes the 'heathen mythology,' which, as he significantly remarks, was not tolerated in Crete, and perhaps (for the meaning of his words is not quite clear) at Sparta.</div><div class="sentence"> He gives no encouragement to individual enthusiasm; 'the establishment of religion could only be the work of a mighty intellect.'</div><div class="sentence"> Like the Hebrews, he prohibits private rites; for the avoidance of superstition, he would transfer all worship of the Gods to the public temples.</div><div class="sentence"> He would not have men and women consecrating the accidents of their lives.</div><div class="sentence"> He trusts to human punishments and not to divine judgments; though he is not unwilling to repeat the old tradition that certain kinds of dishonesty 'prevent a man from having a family.'</div><div class="sentence"> He considers that the 'ages of faith' have passed away and cannot now be recalled.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet he is far from wishing to extirpate the sentiment of religion, which he sees to be common to all mankind—Barbarians as well as Hellenes.</div><div class="sentence"> He remarks that no one passes through life without, sooner or later, experiencing its power.</div><div class="sentence"> To which we may add the further remark that the greater the irreligion, the more violent has often been the religious reaction.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">284</span> <div class="sentence">  It is remarkable that Plato's account of mind at the end of the Laws goes beyond Anaxagoras, and beyond himself in any of his previous writings.</div><div class="sentence"> Aristotle, in a well-known passage (Met.)</div><div class="sentence"> which is an echo of the Phaedo, remarks on the inconsistency of Anaxagoras in introducing the agency of mind, and yet having recourse to other and inferior, probably material causes.</div><div class="sentence"> But Plato makes the further criticism, that the error of Anaxagoras consisted, not in denying the universal agency of mind, but in denying the priority, or, as we should say, the eternity of it.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet in the Timaeus he had himself allowed that God made the world out of pre-existing materials: in the Statesman he says that there were seeds of evil in the world arising out of the remains of a former chaos which could not be got rid of; and even in the Tenth Book of the Laws he has admitted that there are two souls, a good and evil.</div><div class="sentence"> In the Meno, the Phaedrus, and the Phaedo, he had spoken of the recovery of ideas from a former state of existence.</div><div class="sentence"> But now he has attained to a clearer point of view: he has discarded these fancies.</div><div class="sentence"> From meditating on the priority of the human soul to the body, he has learnt the nature of soul absolutely.</div><div class="sentence"> The power of the best, of which he gave an intimation in the Phaedo and in the Republic, now, as in the Philebus, takes the form of an intelligence or person.</div><div class="sentence"> He no longer, like Anaxagoras, supposes mind to be introduced at a certain time into the world and to give order to a pre-existing chaos, but to be prior to the chaos, everlasting and evermoving, and the source of order and intelligence in all things.</div><div class="sentence"> This appears to be the last form of Plato's religious philosophy, which might almost be summed up in the words of Kant, 'the starry heaven above and the moral law within.'</div><div class="sentence"> Or rather, perhaps, 'the starry heaven above and mind prior to the world.'</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">289</span> <div class="sentence">  The Laws of Plato contain the latest phase of his philosophy, showing in many respects an advance, and in others a decline, in his views of life and the world.</div><div class="sentence"> His Theory of Ideas in the next generation passed into one of Numbers, the nature of which we gather chiefly from the Metaphysics of Aristotle.</div><div class="sentence"> Of the speculative side of this theory there are no traces in the Laws, but doubtless Plato found the practical value which he attributed to arithmetic greatly confirmed by the possibility of applying number and measure to the revolution of the heavens, and to the regulation of human life.</div><div class="sentence"> In the return to a doctrine of numbers there is a retrogression rather than an advance; for the most barren logical abstraction is of a higher nature than number and figure.</div><div class="sentence"> Philosophy fades away into the distance; in the Laws it is confined to the members of the Nocturnal Council.</div><div class="sentence"> The speculative truth which was the food of the guardians in the Republic, is for the majority of the citizens to be superseded by practical virtues.</div><div class="sentence"> The law, which is the expression of mind written down, takes the place of the living word of the philosopher.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare the contrast of Phaedrus, and Laws; also the plays on the words nous, nomos, nou dianome; and the discussion in the Statesman of the difference between the personal rule of a king and the impersonal reign of law.)</div><div class="sentence"> The State is based on virtue and religion rather than on knowledge; and virtue is no longer identified with knowledge, being of the commoner sort, and spoken of in the sense generally understood.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet there are many traces of advance as well as retrogression in the Laws of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> The attempt to reconcile the ideal with actual life is an advance; to 'have brought philosophy down from heaven to earth,' is a praise which may be claimed for him as well as for his master Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> And the members of the Nocturnal Council are to continue students of the 'one in many' and of the nature of God.</div><div class="sentence"> Education is the last word with which Plato supposes the theory of the Laws to end and the reality to begin.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">290</span> <div class="sentence">  Plato's increasing appreciation of the difficulties of human affairs, and of the element of chance which so largely influences them, is an indication not of a narrower, but of a maturer mind, which had become more conversant with realities.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor can we fairly attribute any want of originality to him, because he has borrowed many of his provisions from Sparta and Athens.</div><div class="sentence"> Laws and institutions grow out of habits and customs; and they have 'better opinion, better confirmation,' if they have come down from antiquity and are not mere literary inventions.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato would have been the first to acknowledge that the Book of Laws was not the creation of his fancy, but a collection of enactments which had been devised by inspired legislators, like Minos, Lycurgus, and Solon, to meet the actual needs of men, and had been approved by time and experience.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">291</span> <div class="sentence">  In order to do justice therefore to the design of the work, it is necessary to examine how far it rests on an historical foundation and coincides with the actual laws of Sparta and Athens.</div><div class="sentence"> The consideration of the historical aspect of the Laws has been reserved for this place.</div><div class="sentence"> In working out the comparison the writer has been greatly assisted by the excellent essays of C.F.</div><div class="sentence"> Hermann ('De vestigiis institutorum veterum, imprimis Atticorum, per Platonis de Legibus libros indagandis,' and 'Juris domestici et familiaris apud Platonem in Legibus cum veteris Graeciae inque primis Athenarum institutis comparatio': Marburg, 1836), and by J.B.

<h2>EXCURSUS ON THE RELATION OF THE LAWS OF PLATO
TO THE INSTITUTIONS OF CRETE AND LACEDAEMON AND TO THE LAWS AND
CONSTITUTION OF ATHENS.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  The Laws of Plato are essentially Greek: unlike Xenophon's Cyropaedia, they contain nothing foreign or oriental.</div><div class="sentence"> Their aim is to reconstruct the work of the great lawgivers of Hellas in a literary form.</div><div class="sentence"> They partake both of an Athenian and a Spartan character.</div><div class="sentence"> Some of them too are derived from Crete, and are appropriately transferred to a Cretan colony.</div><div class="sentence"> But of Crete so little is known to us, that although, as Montesquieu (Esprit des Lois) remarks, 'the Laws of Crete are the original of those of Sparta and the Laws of Plato the correction of these latter,' there is only one point, viz.</div><div class="sentence"> the common meals, in which they can be compared.</div><div class="sentence"> Most of Plato's provisions resemble the laws and customs which prevailed in these three states (especially in the two former), and which the personifying instinct of the Greeks attributed to Minos, Lycurgus, and Solon.</div><div class="sentence"> A very few particulars may have been borrowed from Zaleucus (Cic.</div><div class="sentence"> de Legibus), and Charondas, who is said to have first made laws against perjury (Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Pol.)</div><div class="sentence"> and to have forbidden credit (Stob.</div><div class="sentence"> Florileg., Gaisford).</div><div class="sentence"> Some enactments are Plato's own, and were suggested by his experience of defects in the Athenian and other Greek states.</div><div class="sentence"> The Laws also contain many lesser provisions, which are not found in the ordinary codes of nations, because they cannot be properly defined, and are therefore better left to custom and common sense.</div><div class="sentence"> 'The greater part of the work,' as Aristotle remarks (Pol.</div><div class="sentence"> ), 'is taken up with laws': yet this is not wholly true, and applies to the latter rather than to the first half of it.</div><div class="sentence"> The book rests on an ethical and religious foundation: the actual laws begin with a hymn of praise in honour of the soul.</div><div class="sentence"> And the same lofty aspiration after the good is perpetually recurring, especially in Books X, XI, XII, and whenever Plato's mind is filled with his highest themes.</div><div class="sentence"> In prefixing to most of his laws a prooemium he has two ends in view, to persuade and also to threaten.</div><div class="sentence"> They are to have the sanction of laws and the effect of sermons.</div><div class="sentence"> And Plato's 'Book of Laws,' if described in the language of modern philosophy, may be said to be as much an ethical and educational, as a political or legal treatise.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  But although the Laws partake both of an Athenian and a Spartan character, the elements which are borrowed from either state are necessarily very different, because the character and origin of the two governments themselves differed so widely.</div><div class="sentence"> Sparta was the more ancient and primitive: Athens was suited to the wants of a later stage of society.</div><div class="sentence"> The relation of the two states to the Laws may be conceived in this manner:—The foundation and ground-plan of the work are more Spartan, while the superstructure and details are more Athenian.</div><div class="sentence"> At Athens the laws were written down and were voluminous; more than a thousand fragments of them have been collected by Telfy.</div><div class="sentence"> Like the Roman or English law, they contained innumerable particulars.</div><div class="sentence"> Those of them which regulated daily life were familiarly known to the Athenians; for every citizen was his own lawyer, and also a judge, who decided the rights of his fellow-citizens according to the laws, often after hearing speeches from the parties interested or from their advocates.</div><div class="sentence"> It is to Rome and not to Athens that the invention of law, in the modern sense of the term, is commonly ascribed.</div><div class="sentence"> But it must be remembered that long before the times of the Twelve Tables (B.C.</div><div class="sentence"> 451), regular courts and forms of law had existed at Athens and probably in the Greek colonies.</div><div class="sentence"> And we may reasonably suppose, though without any express proof of the fact, that many Roman institutions and customs, like Latin literature and mythology, were partly derived from Hellas and had imperceptibly drifted from one shore of the Ionian Sea to the other (compare especially the constitutions of Servius Tullius and of Solon).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  It is not proved that the laws of Sparta were in ancient times either written down in books or engraved on tablets of marble or brass.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor is it certain that, if they had been, the Spartans could have read them.</div><div class="sentence"> They were ancient customs, some of them older probably than the settlement in Laconia, of which the origin is unknown; they occasionally received the sanction of the Delphic oracle, but there was a still stronger obligation by which they were enforced,—the necessity of self-defence: the Spartans were always living in the presence of their enemies.</div><div class="sentence"> They belonged to an age when written law had not yet taken the place of custom and tradition.</div><div class="sentence"> The old constitution was very rarely affected by new enactments, and these only related to the duties of the Kings or Ephors, or the new relations of classes which arose as time went on.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence there was as great a difference as could well be conceived between the Laws of Athens and Sparta: the one was the creation of a civilized state, and did not differ in principle from our modern legislation, the other of an age in which the people were held together and also kept down by force of arms, and which afterwards retained many traces of its barbaric origin 'surviving in culture.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  Nevertheless the Lacedaemonian was the ideal of a primitive Greek state.</div><div class="sentence"> According to Thucydides it was the first which emerged out of confusion and became a regular government.</div><div class="sentence"> It was also an army devoted to military exercises, but organized with a view to self-defence and not to conquest.</div><div class="sentence"> It was not quick to move or easily excited; but stolid, cautious, unambitious, procrastinating.</div><div class="sentence"> For many centuries it retained the same character which was impressed upon it by the hand of the legislator.</div><div class="sentence"> This singular fabric was partly the result of circumstances, partly the invention of some unknown individual in prehistoric times, whose ideal of education was military discipline, and who, by the ascendency of his genius, made a small tribe into a nation which became famous in the world's history.</div><div class="sentence"> The other Hellenes wondered at the strength and stability of his work.</div><div class="sentence"> The rest of Hellas, says Thucydides, undertook the colonisation of Heraclea the more readily, having a feeling of security now that they saw the Lacedaemonians taking part in it.</div><div class="sentence"> The Spartan state appears to us in the dawn of history as a vision of armed men, irresistible by any other power then existing in the world.</div><div class="sentence"> It can hardly be said to have understood at all the rights or duties of nations to one another, or indeed to have had any moral principle except patriotism and obedience to commanders.</div><div class="sentence"> Men were so trained to act together that they lost the freedom and spontaneity of human life in cultivating the qualities of the soldier and ruler.</div><div class="sentence"> The Spartan state was a composite body in which kings, nobles, citizens, perioeci, artisans, slaves, had to find a 'modus vivendi' with one another.</div><div class="sentence"> All of them were taught some use of arms.</div><div class="sentence"> The strength of the family tie was diminished among them by an enforced absence from home and by common meals.</div><div class="sentence"> Sparta had no life or growth; no poetry or tradition of the past; no art, no thought.</div><div class="sentence"> The Athenians started on their great career some centuries later, but the Spartans would have been easily conquered by them, if Athens had not been deficient in the qualities which constituted the strength (and also the weakness) of her rival.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  The ideal of Athens has been pictured for all time in the speech which Thucydides puts into the mouth of Pericles, called the Funeral Oration.</div><div class="sentence"> He contrasts the activity and freedom and pleasantness of Athenian life with the immobility and severe looks and incessant drill of the Spartans.</div><div class="sentence"> The citizens of no city were more versatile, or more readily changed from land to sea or more quickly moved about from place to place.</div><div class="sentence"> They 'took their pleasures' merrily, and yet, when the time for fighting arrived, were not a whit behind the Spartans, who were like men living in a camp, and, though always keeping guard, were often too late for the fray.</div><div class="sentence"> Any foreigner might visit Athens; her ships found a way to the most distant shores; the riches of the whole earth poured in upon her.</div><div class="sentence"> Her citizens had their theatres and festivals; they 'provided their souls with many relaxations'; yet they were not less manly than the Spartans or less willing to sacrifice this enjoyable existence for their country's good.</div><div class="sentence"> The Athenian was a nobler form of life than that of their rivals, a life of music as well as of gymnastic, the life of a citizen as well as of a soldier.</div><div class="sentence"> Such is the picture which Thucydides has drawn of the Athenians in their glory.</div><div class="sentence"> It is the spirit of this life which Plato would infuse into the Magnesian state and which he seeks to combine with the common meals and gymnastic discipline of Sparta.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  The two great types of Athens and Sparta had deeply entered into his mind.</div><div class="sentence"> He had heard of Sparta at a distance and from common Hellenic fame: he was a citizen of Athens and an Athenian of noble birth.</div><div class="sentence"> He must often have sat in the law-courts, and may have had personal experience of the duties of offices such as he is establishing.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no need to ask the question, whence he derived his knowledge of the Laws of Athens: they were a part of his daily life.</div><div class="sentence"> Many of his enactments are recognized to be Athenian laws from the fragments preserved in the Orators and elsewhere: many more would be found to be so if we had better information.</div><div class="sentence"> Probably also still more of them would have been incorporated in the Magnesian code, if the work had ever been finally completed.</div><div class="sentence"> But it seems to have come down to us in a form which is partly finished and partly unfinished, having a beginning and end, but wanting arrangement in the middle.</div><div class="sentence"> The Laws answer to Plato's own description of them, in the comparison which he makes of himself and his two friends to gatherers of stones or the beginners of some composite work, 'who are providing materials and partly putting them together:—having some of their laws, like stones, already fixed in their places, while others lie about.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  Plato's own life coincided with the period at which Athens rose to her greatest heights and sank to her lowest depths.</div><div class="sentence"> It was impossible that he should regard the blessings of democracy in the same light as the men of a former generation, whose view was not intercepted by the evil shadow of the taking of Athens, and who had only the glories of Marathon and Salamis and the administration of Pericles to look back upon.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand the fame and prestige of Sparta, which had outlived so many crimes and blunders, was not altogether lost at the end of the life of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> Hers was the only great Hellenic government which preserved something of its ancient form; and although the Spartan citizens were reduced to almost one-tenth of their original number (Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Pol.</div><div class="sentence"> ), she still retained, until the rise of Thebes and Macedon, a certain authority and predominance due to her final success in the struggle with Athens and to the victories which Agesilaus won in Asia Minor.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  Plato, like Aristotle, had in his mind some form of a mean state which should escape the evils and secure the advantages of both aristocracy and democracy.</div><div class="sentence"> It may however be doubted whether the creation of such a state is not beyond the legislator's art, although there have been examples in history of forms of government, which through some community of interest or of origin, through a balance of parties in the state itself, or through the fear of a common enemy, have for a while preserved such a character of moderation.</div><div class="sentence"> But in general there arises a time in the history of a state when the struggle between the few and the many has to be fought out.</div><div class="sentence"> No system of checks and balances, such as Plato has devised in the Laws, could have given equipoise and stability to an ancient state, any more than the skill of the legislator could have withstood the tide of democracy in England or France during the last hundred years, or have given life to China or India.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span> <div class="sentence">  The basis of the Magnesian constitution is the equal division of land.</div><div class="sentence"> In the new state, as in the Republic, there was to be neither poverty nor riches.</div><div class="sentence"> Every citizen under all circumstances retained his lot, and as much money as was necessary for the cultivation of it, and no one was allowed to accumulate property to the amount of more than five times the value of the lot, inclusive of it.</div><div class="sentence"> The equal division of land was a Spartan institution, not known to have existed elsewhere in Hellas.</div><div class="sentence"> The mention of it in the Laws of Plato affords considerable presumption that it was of ancient origin, and not first introduced, as Mr. Grote and others have imagined, in the reformation of Cleomenes III.</div><div class="sentence"> But at Sparta, if we may judge from the frequent complaints of the accumulation of property in the hands of a few persons (Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Pol.</div><div class="sentence"> ), no provision could have been made for the maintenance of the lot.</div><div class="sentence"> Plutarch indeed speaks of a law introduced by the Ephor Epitadeus soon after the Peloponnesian War, which first allowed the Spartans to sell their land (Agis): but from the manner in which Aristotle refers to the subject, we should imagine this evil in the state to be of a much older standing.</div><div class="sentence"> Like some other countries in which small proprietors have been numerous, the original equality passed into inequality, and, instead of a large middle class, there was probably at Sparta greater disproportion in the property of the citizens than in any other state of Hellas.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato was aware of the danger, and has improved on the Spartan custom.</div><div class="sentence"> The land, as at Sparta, must have been tilled by slaves, since other occupations were found for the citizens.</div><div class="sentence"> Bodies of young men between the ages of twenty-five and thirty were engaged in making biennial peregrinations of the country.</div><div class="sentence"> They and their officers are to be the magistrates, police, engineers, aediles, of the twelve districts into which the colony was divided.</div><div class="sentence"> Their way of life may be compared with that of the Spartan secret police or Crypteia, a name which Plato freely applies to them without apparently any consciousness of the odium which has attached to the word in history.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span> <div class="sentence">  Another great institution which Plato borrowed from Sparta (or Crete) is the Syssitia or common meals.</div><div class="sentence"> These were established in both states, and in some respects were considered by Aristotle to be better managed in Crete than at Lacedaemon (Pol.).</div><div class="sentence"> In the Laws the Cretan custom appears to be adopted (This is not proved, as Hermann supposes ('De Vestigiis,' etc.</div><div class="sentence"> )): that is to say, if we may interpret Plato by Aristotle, the cost of them was defrayed by the state and not by the individuals (Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Pol); so that the members of the mess, who could not pay their quota, still retained their rights of citizenship.</div><div class="sentence"> But this explanation is hardly consistent with the Laws, where contributions to the Syssitia from private estates are expressly mentioned.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato goes further than the legislators of Sparta and Crete, and would extend the common meals to women as well as men: he desires to curb the disorders, which existed among the female sex in both states, by the application to women of the same military discipline to which the men were already subject.</div><div class="sentence"> It was an extension of the custom of Syssitia from which the ancient legislators shrank, and which Plato himself believed to be very difficult of enforcement.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span> <div class="sentence">  Like Sparta, the new colony was not to be surrounded by walls,—a state should learn to depend upon the bravery of its citizens only—a fallacy or paradox, if it is not to be regarded as a poetical fancy, which is fairly enough ridiculed by Aristotle (Pol.).</div><div class="sentence"> Women, too, must be ready to assist in the defence of their country: they are not to rush to the temples and altars, but to arm themselves with shield and spear.</div><div class="sentence"> In the regulation of the Syssitia, in at least one of his enactments respecting property, and in the attempt to correct the licence of women, Plato shows, that while he borrowed from the institutions of Sparta and favoured the Spartan mode of life, he also sought to improve upon them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span> <div class="sentence">  The enmity to the sea is another Spartan feature which is transferred by Plato to the Magnesian state.</div><div class="sentence"> He did not reflect that a non-maritime power would always be at the mercy of one which had a command of the great highway.</div><div class="sentence"> Their many island homes, the vast extent of coast which had to be protected by them, their struggles first of all with the Phoenicians and Carthaginians, and secondly with the Persian fleets, forced the Greeks, mostly against their will, to devote themselves to the sea.</div><div class="sentence"> The islanders before the inhabitants of the continent, the maritime cities before the inland, the Corinthians and Athenians before the Spartans, were compelled to fit out ships: last of all the Spartans, by the pressure of the Peloponnesian War, were driven to establish a naval force, which, after the battle of Aegospotami, for more than a generation commanded the Aegean.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato, like the Spartans, had a prejudice against a navy, because he regarded it as the nursery of democracy.</div><div class="sentence"> But he either never considered, or did not care to explain, how a city, set upon an island and 'distant not more than ten miles from the sea, having a seaboard provided with excellent harbours,' could have safely subsisted without one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span> <div class="sentence">  Neither the Spartans nor the Magnesian colonists were permitted to engage in trade or commerce.</div><div class="sentence"> In order to limit their dealings as far as possible to their own country, they had a separate coinage; the Magnesians were only allowed to use the common currency of Hellas when they travelled abroad, which they were forbidden to do unless they received permission from the government.</div><div class="sentence"> Like the Spartans, Plato was afraid of the evils which might be introduced into his state by intercourse with foreigners; but he also shrinks from the utter exclusiveness of Sparta, and is not unwilling to allow visitors of a suitable age and rank to come from other states to his own, as he also allows citizens of his own state to go to foreign countries and bring back a report of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Such international communication seemed to him both honourable and useful.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span> <div class="sentence">  We may now notice some points in which the commonwealth of the Laws approximates to the Athenian model.</div><div class="sentence"> These are much more numerous than the previous class of resemblances; we are better able to compare the laws of Plato with those of Athens, because a good deal more is known to us of Athens than of Sparta.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span> <div class="sentence">  The information which we possess about Athenian law, though comparatively fuller, is still fragmentary.</div><div class="sentence"> The sources from which our knowledge is derived are chiefly the following:—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span> <div class="sentence">  (1) The Orators,—Antiphon, Andocides, Lysias, Isocrates, Demosthenes, Aeschines, Lycurgus, and others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span> <div class="sentence">  (2) Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, Plato, Aristotle, as well as later writers, such as Cicero de Legibus, Plutarch, Aelian, Pausanias.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span> <div class="sentence">  (3) Lexicographers, such as Harpocration, Pollux, Hesychius, Suidas, and the compiler of the Etymologicum Magnum, many of whom are of uncertain date, and to a great extent based upon one another.</div><div class="sentence"> Their writings extend altogether over more than eight hundred years, from the second to the tenth century.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span> <div class="sentence">  (4) The Scholia on Aristophanes, Plato, Demosthenes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span> <div class="sentence">  (5) A few inscriptions.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span> <div class="sentence">  Our knowledge of a subject derived from such various sources and for the most part of uncertain date and origin, is necessarily precarious.</div><div class="sentence"> No critic can separate the actual laws of Solon from those which passed under his name in later ages.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor do the Scholiasts and Lexicographers attempt to distinguish how many of these laws were still in force at the time when they wrote, or when they fell into disuse and were to be found in books only.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor can we hastily assume that enactments which occur in the Laws of Plato were also a part of Athenian law, however probable this may appear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span> <div class="sentence">  There are two classes of similarities between Plato's Laws and those of Athens: (i) of institutions (ii) of minor enactments.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span> <div class="sentence">  (i) The constitution of the Laws in its general character resembles much more nearly the Athenian constitution of Solon's time than that which succeeded it, or the extreme democracy which prevailed in Plato's own day.</div><div class="sentence"> It was a mean state which he hoped to create, equally unlike a Syracusan tyranny or the mob-government of the Athenian assembly.</div><div class="sentence"> There are various expedients by which he sought to impart to it the quality of moderation.</div><div class="sentence"> (1) The whole people were to be educated: they could not be all trained in philosophy, but they were to acquire the simple elements of music, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy; they were also to be subject to military discipline, archontes kai archomenoi.</div><div class="sentence"> (2) The majority of them were, or had been at some time in their lives, magistrates, and had the experience which is given by office.</div><div class="sentence"> (3) The persons who held the highest offices were to have a further education, not much inferior to that provided for the guardians in the Republic, though the range of their studies is narrowed to the nature and divisions of virtue: here their philosophy comes to an end.</div><div class="sentence"> (4) The entire number of the citizens (5040) rarely, if ever, assembled, except for purposes of elections.</div><div class="sentence"> The whole people were divided into four classes, each having the right to be represented by the same number of members in the Council.</div><div class="sentence"> The result of such an arrangement would be, as in the constitution of Servius Tullius, to give a disproportionate share of power to the wealthier classes, who may be supposed to be always much fewer in number than the poorer.</div><div class="sentence"> This tendency was qualified by the complicated system of selection by vote, previous to the final election by lot, of which the object seems to be to hand over to the wealthy few the power of selecting from the many poor, and vice versa.</div><div class="sentence"> (5) The most important body in the state was the Nocturnal Council, which is borrowed from the Areopagus at Athens, as it existed, or was supposed to have existed, in the days before Ephialtes and the Eumenides of Aeschylus, when its power was undiminished.</div><div class="sentence"> In some particulars Plato appears to have copied exactly the customs and procedure of the Areopagus: both assemblies sat at night (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> There was a resemblance also in more important matters.</div><div class="sentence"> Like the Areopagus, the Nocturnal Council was partly composed of magistrates and other state officials, whose term of office had expired.</div><div class="sentence"> (7) The constitution included several diverse and even opposing elements, such as the Assembly and the Nocturnal Council.</div><div class="sentence"> (8) There was much less exclusiveness than at Sparta; the citizens were to have an interest in the government of neighbouring states, and to know what was going on in the rest of the world.—All these were moderating influences.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span> <div class="sentence">  A striking similarity between Athens and the constitution of the Magnesian colony is the use of the lot in the election of judges and other magistrates.</div><div class="sentence"> That such a mode of election should have been resorted to in any civilized state, or that it should have been transferred by Plato to an ideal or imaginary one, is very singular to us.</div><div class="sentence"> The most extreme democracy of modern times has never thought of leaving government wholly to chance.</div><div class="sentence"> It was natural that Socrates should scoff at it, and ask, 'Who would choose a pilot or carpenter or flute-player by lot' (Xen.</div><div class="sentence"> Mem.)?</div><div class="sentence"> Yet there were many considerations which made this mode of choice attractive both to the oligarch and to the democrat:—(1) It seemed to recognize that one man was as good as another, and that all the members of the governing body, whether few or many, were on a perfect equality in every sense of the word.</div><div class="sentence"> (2) To the pious mind it appeared to be a choice made, not by man, but by heaven (compare Laws).</div><div class="sentence"> (3) It afforded a protection against corruption and intrigue...It must also be remembered that, although elected by lot, the persons so elected were subject to a scrutiny before they entered on their office, and were therefore liable, after election, if disqualified, to be rejected (Laws).</div><div class="sentence"> They were, moreover, liable to be called to account after the expiration of their office.</div><div class="sentence"> In the election of councillors Plato introduces a further check: they are not to be chosen directly by lot from all the citizens, but from a select body previously elected by vote.</div><div class="sentence"> In Plato's state at least, as we may infer from his silence on this point, judges and magistrates performed their duties without pay, which was a guarantee both of their disinterestedness and of their belonging probably to the higher class of citizens (compare Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Pol.).</div><div class="sentence"> Hence we are not surprised that the use of the lot prevailed, not only in the election of the Athenian Council, but also in many oligarchies, and even in Plato's colony.</div><div class="sentence"> The evil consequences of the lot are to a great extent avoided, if the magistrates so elected do not, like the dicasts at Athens, receive pay from the state.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span> <div class="sentence">  Another parallel is that of the Popular Assembly, which at Athens was omnipotent, but in the Laws has only a faded and secondary existence.</div><div class="sentence"> In Plato it was chiefly an elective body, having apparently no judicial and little political power entrusted to it.</div><div class="sentence"> At Athens it was the mainspring of the democracy; it had the decision of war or peace, of life and death; the acts of generals or statesmen were authorized or condemned by it; no office or person was above its control.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato was far from allowing such a despotic power to exist in his model community, and therefore he minimizes the importance of the Assembly and narrows its functions.</div><div class="sentence"> He probably never asked himself a question, which naturally occurs to the modern reader, where was to be the central authority in this new community, and by what supreme power would the differences of inferior powers be decided.</div><div class="sentence"> At the same time he magnifies and brings into prominence the Nocturnal Council (which is in many respects a reflection of the Areopagus), but does not make it the governing body of the state.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span> <div class="sentence">  Between the judicial system of the Laws and that of Athens there was very great similarity, and a difference almost equally great.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato not unfrequently adopts the details when he rejects the principle.</div><div class="sentence"> At Athens any citizen might be a judge and member of the great court of the Heliaea.</div><div class="sentence"> This was ordinarily subdivided into a number of inferior courts, but an occasion is recorded on which the whole body, in number six thousand, met in a single court (Andoc.</div><div class="sentence"> de Myst.).</div><div class="sentence"> Plato significantly remarks that a few judges, if they are good, are better than a great number.</div><div class="sentence"> He also, at least in capital cases, confines the plaintiff and defendant to a single speech each, instead of allowing two apiece, as was the common practice at Athens.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, in all private suits he gives two appeals, from the arbiters to the courts of the tribes, and from the courts of the tribes to the final or supreme court.</div><div class="sentence"> There was nothing answering to this at Athens.</div><div class="sentence"> The three courts were appointed in the following manner:—the arbiters were to be agreed upon by the parties to the cause; the judges of the tribes to be elected by lot; the highest tribunal to be chosen at the end of each year by the great officers of state out of their own number—they were to serve for a year, to undergo a scrutiny, and, unlike the Athenian judges, to vote openly.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato does not dwell upon methods of procedure: these are the lesser matters which he leaves to the younger legislators.</div><div class="sentence"> In cases of murder and some other capital offences, the cause was to be tried by a special tribunal, as was the custom at Athens: military offences, too, as at Athens, were decided by the soldiers.</div><div class="sentence"> Public causes in the Laws, as sometimes at Athens, were voted upon by the whole people: because, as Plato remarks, they are all equally concerned in them.</div><div class="sentence"> They were to be previously investigated by three of the principal magistrates.</div><div class="sentence"> He believes also that in private suits all should take part; 'for he who has no share in the administration of justice is apt to imagine that he has no share in the state at all.'</div><div class="sentence"> The wardens of the country, like the Forty at Athens, also exercised judicial power in small matters, as well as the wardens of the agora and city.</div><div class="sentence"> The department of justice is better organized in Plato than in an ordinary Greek state, proceeding more by regular methods, and being more restricted to distinct duties.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span> <div class="sentence">  The executive of Plato's Laws, like the Athenian, was different from that of a modern civilized state.</div><div class="sentence"> The difference chiefly consists in this, that whereas among ourselves there are certain persons or classes of persons set apart for the execution of the duties of government, in ancient Greece, as in all other communities in the earlier stages of their development, they were not equally distinguished from the rest of the citizens.</div><div class="sentence"> The machinery of government was never so well organized as in the best modern states.</div><div class="sentence"> The judicial department was not so completely separated from the legislative, nor the executive from the judicial, nor the people at large from the professional soldier, lawyer, or priest.</div><div class="sentence"> To Aristotle (Pol.)</div><div class="sentence"> it was a question requiring serious consideration—Who should execute a sentence?</div><div class="sentence"> There was probably no body of police to whom were entrusted the lives and properties of the citizens in any Hellenic state.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence it might be reasonably expected that every man should be the watchman of every other, and in turn be watched by him.</div><div class="sentence"> The ancients do not seem to have remembered the homely adage that, 'What is every man's business is no man's business,' or always to have thought of applying the principle of a division of labour to the administration of law and to government.</div><div class="sentence"> Every Athenian was at some time or on some occasion in his life a magistrate, judge, advocate, soldier, sailor, policeman.</div><div class="sentence"> He had not necessarily any private business; a good deal of his time was taken up with the duties of office and other public occupations.</div><div class="sentence"> So, too, in Plato's Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> A citizen was to interfere in a quarrel, if older than the combatants, or to defend the outraged party, if his junior.</div><div class="sentence"> He was especially bound to come to the rescue of a parent who was ill-treated by his children.</div><div class="sentence"> He was also required to prosecute the murderer of a kinsman.</div><div class="sentence"> In certain cases he was allowed to arrest an offender.</div><div class="sentence"> He might even use violence to an abusive person.</div><div class="sentence"> Any citizen who was not less than thirty years of age at times exercised a magisterial authority, to be enforced even by blows.</div><div class="sentence"> Both in the Magnesian state and at Athens many thousand persons must have shared in the highest duties of government, if a section only of the Council, consisting of thirty or of fifty persons, as in the Laws, or at Athens after the days of Cleisthenes, held office for a month, or for thirty-five days only.</div><div class="sentence"> It was almost as if, in our own country, the Ministry or the Houses of Parliament were to change every month.</div><div class="sentence"> The average ability of the Athenian and Magnesian councillors could not have been very high, considering there were so many of them.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet they were entrusted with the performance of the most important executive duties.</div><div class="sentence"> In these respects the constitution of the Laws resembles Athens far more than Sparta.</div><div class="sentence"> All the citizens were to be, not merely soldiers, but politicians and administrators.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span> <div class="sentence">  (ii) There are numerous minor particulars in which the Laws of Plato resemble those of Athens.</div><div class="sentence"> These are less interesting than the preceding, but they show even more strikingly how closely in the composition of his work Plato has followed the laws and customs of his own country.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span> <div class="sentence">  (1) Evidence.</div><div class="sentence"> (a) At Athens a child was not allowed to give evidence (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> Plato has a similar law: 'A child shall be allowed to give evidence only in cases of murder.'</div><div class="sentence"> (b) At Athens an unwilling witness might be summoned; but he was not required to appear if he was ready to declare on oath that he knew nothing about the matter in question (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> So in the Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> (c) Athenian law enacted that when more than half the witnesses in a case had been convicted of perjury, there was to be a new trial (anadikos krisis—Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> There is a similar provision in the Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> (d) False-witness was punished at Athens by atimia and a fine (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> Plato is at once more lenient and more severe: 'If a man be twice convicted of false-witness, he shall not be required, and if thrice, he shall not be allowed to bear witness; and if he dare to witness after he has been convicted three times,...he shall be punished with death.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span> <div class="sentence">  (2) Murder.</div><div class="sentence"> (a) Wilful murder was punished in Athenian law by death, perpetual exile, and confiscation of property (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> Plato, too, has the alternative of death or exile, but he does not confiscate the murderer's property.</div><div class="sentence"> (b) The Parricide was not allowed to escape by going into exile at Athens (Telfy), nor, apparently, in the Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> (c) A homicide, if forgiven by his victim before death, received no punishment, either at Athens (Telfy), or in the Magnesian state.</div><div class="sentence"> In both (Telfy) the contriver of a murder is punished as severely as the doer; and persons accused of the crime are forbidden to enter temples or the agora until they have been tried (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> (d) At Athens slaves who killed their masters and were caught red-handed, were not to be put to death by the relations of the murdered man, but to be handed over to the magistrates (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> So in the Laws, the slave who is guilty of wilful murder has a public execution: but if the murder is committed in anger, it is punished by the kinsmen of the victim.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span> <div class="sentence">  (3) Involuntary homicide.</div><div class="sentence"> (a) The guilty person, according to the Athenian law, had to go into exile, and might not return, until the family of the man slain were conciliated.</div><div class="sentence"> Then he must be purified (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> If he is caught before he has obtained forgiveness, he may be put to death.</div><div class="sentence"> These enactments reappear in the Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> (b) The curious provision of Plato, that a stranger who has been banished for involuntary homicide and is subsequently wrecked upon the coast, must 'take up his abode on the sea-shore, wetting his feet in the sea, and watching for an opportunity of sailing,' recalls the procedure of the Judicium Phreatteum at Athens, according to which an involuntary homicide, who, having gone into exile, is accused of a wilful murder, was tried at Phreatto for this offence in a boat by magistrates on the shore.</div><div class="sentence"> (c) A still more singular law, occurring both in the Athenian and Magnesian code, enacts that a stone or other inanimate object which kills a man is to be tried, and cast over the border (Telfy).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span> <div class="sentence">  (4) Justifiable or excusable homicide.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato and Athenian law agree in making homicide justifiable or excusable in the following cases:—(1) at the games (Telfy); (2) in war (Telfy); (3) if the person slain was found doing violence to a free woman (Telfy); (4) if a doctor's patient dies; (5) in the case of a robber (Telfy); (6) in self-defence (Telfy).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span> <div class="sentence">  (5) Impiety.</div><div class="sentence"> Death or expulsion was the Athenian penalty for impiety (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> In the Laws it is punished in various cases by imprisonment for five years, for life, and by death.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span> <div class="sentence">  (6) Sacrilege.</div><div class="sentence"> Robbery of temples at Athens was punished by death, refusal of burial in the land, and confiscation of property (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> In the Laws the citizen who is guilty of such a crime is to 'perish ingloriously and be cast beyond the borders of the land,' but his property is not confiscated.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span> <div class="sentence">  (7) Sorcery.</div><div class="sentence"> The sorcerer at Athens was to be executed (Telfy): compare Laws, where it is enacted that the physician who poisons and the professional sorcerer shall be punished with death.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span> <div class="sentence">  (8) Treason.</div><div class="sentence"> Both at Athens and in the Laws the penalty for treason was death (Telfy), and refusal of burial in the country (Telfy).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span> <div class="sentence">  (9) Sheltering exiles.</div><div class="sentence"> 'If a man receives an exile, he shall be punished with death.'</div><div class="sentence"> So, too, in Athenian law (Telfy.</div><div class="sentence"> ).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span> <div class="sentence">  (10) Wounding.</div><div class="sentence"> Athenian law compelled a man who had wounded another to go into exile; if he returned, he was to be put to death (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> Plato only punishes the offence with death when children wound their parents or one another, or a slave wounds his master.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span> <div class="sentence">  (11) Bribery.</div><div class="sentence"> Death was the punishment for taking a bribe, both at Athens (Telfy) and in the Laws; but Athenian law offered an alternative—the payment of a fine of ten times the amount of the bribe.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">040</span> <div class="sentence">  (12) Theft.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato, like Athenian law (Telfy), punishes the theft of public property by death; the theft of private property in both involves a fine of double the value of the stolen goods (Telfy).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span> <div class="sentence">  (13) Suicide.</div><div class="sentence"> He 'who slays him who of all men, as they say, is his own best friend,' is regarded in the same spirit by Plato and by Athenian law.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato would have him 'buried ingloriously on the borders of the twelve portions of the land, in such places as are uncultivated and nameless,' and 'no column or inscription is to mark the place of his interment.'</div><div class="sentence"> Athenian law enacted that the hand which did the deed should be separated from the body and be buried apart (Telfy).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span> <div class="sentence">  (14) Injury.</div><div class="sentence"> In cases of wilful injury, Athenian law compelled the guilty person to pay double the damage; in cases of involuntary injury, simple damages (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> Plato enacts that if a man wounds another in passion, and the wound is curable, he shall pay double the damage, if incurable or disfiguring, fourfold damages.</div><div class="sentence"> If, however, the wounding is accidental, he shall simply pay for the harm done.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">043</span> <div class="sentence">  (15) Treatment of parents.</div><div class="sentence"> Athenian law allowed any one to indict another for neglect or illtreatment of parents (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> So Plato bids bystanders assist a father who is assaulted by his son, and allows any one to give information against children who neglect their parents.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">044</span> <div class="sentence">  (16) Execution of sentences.</div><div class="sentence"> Both Plato and Athenian law give to the winner of a suit power to seize the goods of the loser, if he does not pay within the appointed time (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> At Athens the penalty was also doubled (Telfy); not so in Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato however punishes contempt of court by death, which at Athens seems only to have been visited with a further fine (Telfy).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span> <div class="sentence">  (17) Property.</div><div class="sentence"> (a) Both at Athens and in the Laws a man who has disputed property in his possession must give the name of the person from whom he received it (Telfy); and any one searching for lost property must enter a house naked (Telfy), or, as Plato says, 'naked, or wearing only a short tunic and without a girdle.</div><div class="sentence"> (b) Athenian law, as well as Plato, did not allow a father to disinherit his son without good reason and the consent of impartial persons (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> Neither grants to the eldest son any special claim on the paternal estate (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> In the law of inheritance both prefer males to females (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> (c) Plato and Athenian law enacted that a tree should be planted at a fair distance from a neighbour's property (Telfy), and that when a man could not get water, his neighbour must supply him (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> Both at Athens and in Plato there is a law about bees, the former providing that a beehive must be set up at not less a distance than 300 feet from a neighbour's (Telfy), and the latter forbidding the decoying of bees.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">046</span> <div class="sentence">  (18) Orphans.</div><div class="sentence"> A ward must proceed against a guardian whom he suspects of fraud within five years of the expiration of the guardianship.</div><div class="sentence"> This provision is common to Plato and to Athenian law (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> Further, the latter enacted that the nearest male relation should marry or provide a husband for an heiress (Telfy),—a point in which Plato follows it closely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">047</span> <div class="sentence">  (19) Contracts.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato's law that 'when a man makes an agreement which he does not fulfil, unless the agreement be of a nature which the law or a vote of the assembly does not allow, or which he has made under the influence of some unjust compulsion, or which he is prevented from fulfilling against his will by some unexpected chance,—the other party may go to law with him,' according to Pollux (quoted in Telfy's note) prevailed also at Athens.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">048</span> <div class="sentence">  (20) Trade regulations.</div><div class="sentence"> (a) Lying was forbidden in the agora both by Plato and at Athens (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> (b) Athenian law allowed an action of recovery against a man who sold an unsound slave as sound (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> Plato's enactment is more explicit: he allows only an unskilled person (i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> one who is not a trainer or physician) to take proceedings in such a case.</div><div class="sentence"> (c) Plato diverges from Athenian practice in the disapproval of credit, and does not even allow the supply of goods on the deposit of a percentage of their value (Telfy).</div><div class="sentence"> He enacts that 'when goods are exchanged by buying and selling, a man shall deliver them and receive the price of them at a fixed place in the agora, and have done with the matter,' and that 'he who gives credit must be satisfied whether he obtain his money or not, for in such exchanges he will not be protected by law.</div><div class="sentence"> (d) Athenian law forbad an extortionate rate of interest (Telfy); Plato allows interest in one case only—if a contractor does not receive the price of his work within a year of the time agreed—and at the rate of 200 per cent.</div><div class="sentence"> per annum for every drachma a monthly interest of an obol.</div><div class="sentence"> (e) Both at Athens and in the Laws sales were to be registered (Telfy), as well as births (Telfy).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">049</span> <div class="sentence">  (21) Sumptuary laws.</div><div class="sentence"> Extravagance at weddings (Telfy), and at funerals (Telfy) was forbidden at Athens and also in the Magnesian state.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">050</span> <div class="sentence">  There remains the subject of family life, which in Plato's Laws partakes both of an Athenian and Spartan character.</div><div class="sentence"> Under this head may conveniently be included the condition of women and of slaves.</div><div class="sentence"> To family life may be added citizenship.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span> <div class="sentence">  As at Sparta, marriages are to be contracted for the good of the state; and they may be dissolved on the same ground, where there is a failure of issue,—the interest of the state requiring that every one of the 5040 lots should have an heir.</div><div class="sentence"> Divorces are likewise permitted by Plato where there is an incompatibility of temper, as at Athens by mutual consent.</div><div class="sentence"> The duty of having children is also enforced by a still higher motive, expressed by Plato in the noble words:—'A man should cling to immortality, and leave behind him children's children to be the servants of God in his place.'</div><div class="sentence"> Again, as at Athens, the father is allowed to put away his undutiful son, but only with the consent of impartial persons (Telfy), and the only suit which may be brought by a son against a father is for imbecility.</div><div class="sentence"> The class of elder and younger men and women are still to regard one another, as in the Republic, as standing in the relation of parents and children.</div><div class="sentence"> This is a trait of Spartan character rather than of Athenian.</div><div class="sentence"> A peculiar sanctity and tenderness was to be shown towards the aged; the parent or grandparent stricken with years was to be loved and worshipped like the image of a God, and was to be deemed far more able than any lifeless statue to bring good or ill to his descendants.</div><div class="sentence"> Great care is to be taken of orphans: they are entrusted to the fifteen eldest Guardians of the Law, who are to be 'lawgivers and fathers to them not inferior to their natural fathers,' as at Athens they were entrusted to the Archons.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato wishes to make the misfortune of orphanhood as little sad to them as possible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span> <div class="sentence">  Plato, seeing the disorder into which half the human race had fallen at Athens and Sparta, is minded to frame for them a new rule of life.</div><div class="sentence"> He renounces his fanciful theory of communism, but still desires to place women as far as possible on an equality with men.</div><div class="sentence"> They were to be trained in the use of arms, they are to live in public.</div><div class="sentence"> Their time was partly taken up with gymnastic exercises; there could have been little family or private life among them.</div><div class="sentence"> Their lot was to be neither like that of Spartan women, who were made hard and common by excessive practice of gymnastic and the want of all other education,—nor yet like that of Athenian women, who, at least among the upper classes, retired into a sort of oriental seclusion,—but something better than either.</div><div class="sentence"> They were to be the perfect mothers of perfect children, yet not wholly taken up with the duties of motherhood, which were to be made easy to them as far as possible (compare Republic), but able to share in the perils of war and to be the companions of their husbands.</div><div class="sentence"> Here, more than anywhere else, the spirit of the Laws reverts to the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> In speaking of them as the companions of their husbands we must remember that it is an Athenian and not a Spartan way of life which they are invited to share, a life of gaiety and brightness, not of austerity and abstinence, which often by a reaction degenerated into licence and grossness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span> <div class="sentence">  In Plato's age the subject of slavery greatly interested the minds of thoughtful men; and how best to manage this 'troublesome piece of goods' exercised his own mind a good deal.</div><div class="sentence"> He admits that they have often been found better than brethren or sons in the hour of danger, and are capable of rendering important public services by informing against offenders—for this they are to be rewarded; and the master who puts a slave to death for the sake of concealing some crime which he has committed, is held guilty of murder.</div><div class="sentence"> But they are not always treated with equal consideration.</div><div class="sentence"> The punishments inflicted on them bear no proportion to their crimes.</div><div class="sentence"> They are to be addressed only in the language of command.</div><div class="sentence"> Their masters are not to jest with them, lest they should increase the hardship of their lot.</div><div class="sentence"> Some privileges were granted to them by Athenian law of which there is no mention in Plato; they were allowed to purchase their freedom from their master, and if they despaired of being liberated by him they could demand to be sold, on the chance of falling into better hands.</div><div class="sentence"> But there is no suggestion in the Laws that a slave who tried to escape should be branded with the words—kateche me, pheugo, or that evidence should be extracted from him by torture, that the whole household was to be executed if the master was murdered and the perpetrator remained undetected: all these were provisions of Athenian law.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato is more consistent than either the Athenians or the Spartans; for at Sparta too the Helots were treated in a manner almost unintelligible to us.</div><div class="sentence"> On the one hand, they had arms put into their hands, and served in the army, not only, as at Plataea, in attendance on their masters, but, after they had been manumitted, as a separate body of troops called Neodamodes: on the other hand, they were the victims of one of the greatest crimes recorded in Greek history (Thucyd.).</div><div class="sentence"> The two great philosophers of Hellas sought to extricate themselves from this cruel condition of human life, but acquiesced in the necessity of it.</div><div class="sentence"> A noble and pathetic sentiment of Plato, suggested by the thought of their misery, may be quoted in this place:—'The right treatment of slaves is to behave properly to them, and to do to them, if possible, even more justice than to those who are our equals; for he who naturally and genuinely reverences justice, and hates injustice, is discovered in his dealings with any class of men to whom he can easily be unjust.</div><div class="sentence"> And he who in regard to the natures and actions of his slaves is undefiled by impiety and injustice, will best sow the seeds of virtue in them; and this may be truly said of every master, and tyrant, and of every other having authority in relation to his inferiors.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span> <div class="sentence">  All the citizens of the Magnesian state were free and equal; there was no distinction of rank among them, such as is believed to have prevailed at Sparta.</div><div class="sentence"> Their number was a fixed one, corresponding to the 5040 lots.</div><div class="sentence"> One of the results of this is the requirement that younger sons or those who have been disinherited shall go out to a colony.</div><div class="sentence"> At Athens, where there was not the same religious feeling against increasing the size of the city, the number of citizens must have been liable to considerable fluctuations.</div><div class="sentence"> Several classes of persons, who were not citizens by birth, were admitted to the privilege.</div><div class="sentence"> Perpetual exiles from other countries, people who settled there to practise a trade (Telfy), any one who had shown distinguished valour in the cause of Athens, the Plataeans who escaped from the siege, metics and strangers who offered to serve in the army, the slaves who fought at Arginusae,—all these could or did become citizens.</div><div class="sentence"> Even those who were only on one side of Athenian parentage were at more than one period accounted citizens.</div><div class="sentence"> But at times there seems to have arisen a feeling against this promiscuous extension of the citizen body, an expression of which is to be found in the law of Pericles—monous Athenaious einai tous ek duoin Athenaion gegonotas (Plutarch, Pericles); and at no time did the adopted citizen enjoy the full rights of citizenship—e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> he might not be elected archon or to the office of priest (Telfy), although this prohibition did not extend to his children, if born of a citizen wife.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato never thinks of making the metic, much less the slave, a citizen.</div><div class="sentence"> His treatment of the former class is at once more gentle and more severe than that which prevailed at Athens.</div><div class="sentence"> He imposes upon them no tax but good behaviour, whereas at Athens they were required to pay twelve drachmae per annum, and to have a patron: on the other hand, he only allows them to reside in the Magnesian state on condition of following a trade; they were required to depart when their property exceeded that of the third class, and in any case after a residence of twenty years, unless they could show that they had conferred some great benefit on the state.</div><div class="sentence"> This privileged position reflects that of the isoteleis at Athens, who were excused from the metoikion.</div><div class="sentence"> It is Plato's greatest concession to the metic, as the bestowal of freedom is his greatest concession to the slave.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span> <div class="sentence">  Lastly, there is a more general point of view under which the Laws of Plato may be considered,—the principles of Jurisprudence which are contained in them.</div><div class="sentence"> These are not formally announced, but are scattered up and down, to be observed by the reflective reader for himself.</div><div class="sentence"> Some of them are only the common principles which all courts of justice have gathered from experience; others are peculiar and characteristic.</div><div class="sentence"> That judges should sit at fixed times and hear causes in a regular order, that evidence should be laid before them, that false witnesses should be disallowed, and corruption punished, that defendants should be heard before they are convicted,—these are the rules, not only of the Hellenic courts, but of courts of law in all ages and countries.</div><div class="sentence"> But there are also points which are peculiar, and in which ancient jurisprudence differs considerably from modern; some of them are of great importance...It could not be said at Athens, nor was it ever contemplated by Plato, that all men, including metics and slaves, should be equal 'in the eye of the law.'</div><div class="sentence"> There was some law for the slave, but not much; no adequate protection was given him against the cruelty of his master...It was a singular privilege granted, both by the Athenian and Magnesian law, to a murdered man, that he might, before he died, pardon his murderer, in which case no legal steps were afterwards to be taken against him.</div><div class="sentence"> This law is the remnant of an age in which the punishment of offences against the person was the concern rather of the individual and his kinsmen than of the state...Plato's division of crimes into voluntary and involuntary and those done from passion, only partially agrees with the distinction which modern law has drawn between murder and manslaughter; his attempt to analyze them is confused by the Socratic paradox, that 'All vice is involuntary'...It is singular that both in the Laws and at Athens theft is commonly punished by a twofold restitution of the article stolen.</div><div class="sentence"> The distinction between civil and criminal courts or suits was not yet recognized...Possession gives a right of property after a certain time...The religious aspect under which certain offences were regarded greatly interfered with a just and natural estimate of their guilt...As among ourselves, the intent to murder was distinguished by Plato from actual murder...We note that both in Plato and the laws of Athens, libel in the market-place and personality in the theatre were forbidden...Both in Plato and Athenian law, as in modern times, the accomplice of a crime is to be punished as well as the principal...Plato does not allow a witness in a cause to act as a judge of it...Oaths are not to be taken by the parties to a suit...Both at Athens and in Plato's Laws capital punishment for murder was not to be inflicted, if the offender was willing to go into exile...Respect for the dead, duty towards parents, are to be enforced by the law as well as by public opinion...Plato proclaims the noble sentiment that the object of all punishment is the improvement of the offender...</div><div class="sentence"> Finally, he repeats twice over, as with the voice of a prophet, that the crimes of the fathers are not to be visited upon the children.</div><div class="sentence"> In this respect he is nobly distinguished from the Oriental, and indeed from the spirit of Athenian law (compare Telfy,—dei kai autous kai tous ek touton atimous einai), as the Hebrew in the age of Ezekial is from the Jewish people of former ages.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span> <div class="sentence">  Of all Plato's provisions the object is to bring the practice of the law more into harmony with reason and philosophy; to secure impartiality, and while acknowledging that every citizen has a right to share in the administration of justice, to counteract the tendency of the courts to become mere popular assemblies.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span> <div class="sentence">  ...</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span> <div class="sentence">  Thus we have arrived at the end of the writings of Plato, and at the last stage of philosophy which was really his.</div><div class="sentence"> For in what followed, which we chiefly gather from the uncertain intimations of Aristotle, the spirit of the master no longer survived.</div><div class="sentence"> The doctrine of Ideas passed into one of numbers; instead of advancing from the abstract to the concrete, the theories of Plato were taken out of their context, and either asserted or refuted with a provoking literalism; the Socratic or Platonic element in his teaching was absorbed into the Pythagorean or Megarian.</div><div class="sentence"> His poetry was converted into mysticism; his unsubstantial visions were assailed secundum artem by the rules of logic.</div><div class="sentence"> His political speculations lost their interest when the freedom of Hellas had passed away.</div><div class="sentence"> Of all his writings the Laws were the furthest removed from the traditions of the Platonic school in the next generation.</div><div class="sentence"> Both his political and his metaphysical philosophy are for the most part misinterpreted by Aristotle.</div><div class="sentence"> The best of him—his love of truth, and his 'contemplation of all time and all existence,' was soonest lost; and some of his greatest thoughts have slept in the ear of mankind almost ever since they were first uttered.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span> <div class="sentence">  We have followed him during his forty or fifty years of authorship, from the beginning when he first attempted to depict the teaching of Socrates in a dramatic form, down to the time at which the character of Socrates had disappeared, and we have the latest reflections of Plato's own mind upon Hellas and upon philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> He, who was 'the last of the poets,' in his book of Laws writes prose only; he has himself partly fallen under the rhetorical influences which in his earlier dialogues he was combating.</div><div class="sentence"> The progress of his writings is also the history of his life; we have no other authentic life of him.</div><div class="sentence"> They are the true self of the philosopher, stripped of the accidents of time and place.</div><div class="sentence"> The great effort which he makes is, first, to realize abstractions, secondly, to connect them.</div><div class="sentence"> In the attempt to realize them, he was carried into a transcendental region in which he isolated them from experience, and we pass out of the range of science into poetry or fiction.</div><div class="sentence"> The fancies of mythology for a time cast a veil over the gulf which divides phenomena from onta (Meno, Phaedrus, Symposium, Phaedo).</div><div class="sentence"> In his return to earth Plato meets with a difficulty which has long ceased to be a difficulty to us.</div><div class="sentence"> He cannot understand how these obstinate, unmanageable ideas, residing alone in their heaven of abstraction, can be either combined with one another, or adapted to phenomena (Parmenides, Philebus, Sophist).</div><div class="sentence"> That which is the most familiar process of our own minds, to him appeared to be the crowning achievement of the dialectical art.</div><div class="sentence"> The difficulty which in his own generation threatened to be the destruction of philosophy, he has rendered unmeaning and ridiculous.</div><div class="sentence"> For by his conquests in the world of mind our thoughts are widened, and he has furnished us with new dialectical instruments which are of greater compass and power.</div><div class="sentence"> We have endeavoured to see him as he truly was, a great original genius struggling with unequal conditions of knowledge, not prepared with a system nor evolving in a series of dialogues ideas which he had long conceived, but contradictory, enquiring as he goes along, following the argument, first from one point of view and then from another, and therefore arriving at opposite conclusions, hovering around the light, and sometimes dazzled with excess of light, but always moving in the same element of ideal truth.</div><div class="sentence"> We have seen him also in his decline, when the wings of his imagination have begun to droop, but his experience of life remains, and he turns away from the contemplation of the eternal to take a last sad look at human affairs.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span> <div class="sentence">  ...</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span> <div class="sentence">  And so having brought into the world 'noble children' (Phaedr.</div><div class="sentence"> ), he rests from the labours of authorship.</div><div class="sentence"> More than two thousand two hundred years have passed away since he returned to the place of Apollo and the Muses.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet the echo of his words continues to be heard among men, because of all philosophers he has the most melodious voice.</div><div class="sentence"> He is the inspired prophet or teacher who can never die, the only one in whom the outward form adequately represents the fair soul within; in whom the thoughts of all who went before him are reflected and of all who come after him are partly anticipated.</div><div class="sentence"> Other teachers of philosophy are dried up and withered,—after a few centuries they have become dust; but he is fresh and blooming, and is always begetting new ideas in the minds of men.</div><div class="sentence"> They are one-sided and abstract; but he has many sides of wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor is he always consistent with himself, because he is always moving onward, and knows that there are many more things in philosophy than can be expressed in words, and that truth is greater than consistency.</div><div class="sentence"> He who approaches him in the most reverent spirit shall reap most of the fruit of his wisdom; he who reads him by the light of ancient commentators will have the least understanding of him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span> <div class="sentence">  We may see him with the eye of the mind in the groves of the Academy, or on the banks of the Ilissus, or in the streets of Athens, alone or walking with Socrates, full of those thoughts which have since become the common possession of mankind.</div><div class="sentence"> Or we may compare him to a statue hid away in some temple of Zeus or Apollo, no longer existing on earth, a statue which has a look as of the God himself.</div><div class="sentence"> Or we may once more imagine him following in another state of being the great company of heaven which he beheld of old in a vision (Phaedr.).</div><div class="sentence"> So, 'partly trifling, but with a certain degree of seriousness' (Symp.</div><div class="sentence"> ), we linger around the memory of a world which has passed away (Phaedr.</div><div class="sentence"> ).</div></div>

<div class="book_description">PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:</div> An Athenian Stranger, Cleinias (a Cretan), Megillus (a Lacedaemonian). 
</div><div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Tell me, Strangers, is a God or some man supposed to be the author of your laws?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  A God, Stranger; in very truth a God:  among us Cretans he is said to have been Zeus, but in Lacedaemon, whence our friend here comes, I believe they would say that Apollo is their lawgiver:  would they not, Megillus?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And do you, Cleinias, believe, as Homer tells, that every ninth year Minos went to converse with his Olympian sire, and was inspired by him to make laws for your cities?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, that is our tradition; and there was Rhadamanthus, a brother of his, with whose name you are familiar; he is reputed to have been the justest of men, and we Cretans are of opinion that he earned this reputation from his righteous administration of justice when he was alive.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, and a noble reputation it was, worthy of a son of Zeus.</div><div class="sentence"> As you and Megillus have been trained in these institutions, I dare say that you will not be unwilling to give an account of your government and laws; on our way we can pass the time pleasantly in talking about them, for I am told that the distance from Cnosus to the cave and temple of Zeus is considerable; and doubtless there are shady places under the lofty trees, which will protect us from this scorching sun.</div><div class="sentence"> Being no longer young, we may often stop to rest beneath them, and get over the whole journey without difficulty, beguiling the time by conversation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Stranger, and if we proceed onward we shall come to groves of cypresses, which are of rare height and beauty, and there are green meadows, in which we may repose and converse.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good, indeed; and still better when we see them; let us move on cheerily.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I am willing—And first, I want to know why the law has ordained that you shall have common meals and gymnastic exercises, and wear arms.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I think, Stranger, that the aim of our institutions is easily intelligible to any one.</div><div class="sentence"> Look at the character of our country:  Crete is not like Thessaly, a large plain; and for this reason they have horsemen in Thessaly, and we have runners—the inequality of the ground in our country is more adapted to locomotion on foot; but then, if you have runners you must have light arms—no one can carry a heavy weight when running, and bows and arrows are convenient because they are light.</div><div class="sentence"> Now all these regulations have been made with a view to war, and the legislator appears to me to have looked to this in all his arrangements: —the common meals, if I am not mistaken, were instituted by him for a similar reason, because he saw that while they are in the field the citizens are by the nature of the case compelled to take their meals together for the sake of mutual protection.</div><div class="sentence"> He seems to me to have thought the world foolish in not understanding that all men are always at war with one another; and if in war there ought to be common meals and certain persons regularly appointed under others to protect an army, they should be continued in peace.</div><div class="sentence"> For what men in general term peace would be said by him to be only a name; in reality every city is in a natural state of war with every other, not indeed proclaimed by heralds, but everlasting.</div><div class="sentence"> And if you look closely, you will find that this was the intention of the Cretan legislator; all institutions, private as well as public, were arranged by him with a view to war; in giving them he was under the impression that no possessions or institutions are of any value to him who is defeated in battle; for all the good things of the conquered pass into the hands of the conquerors.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  You appear to me, Stranger, to have been thoroughly trained in the Cretan institutions, and to be well informed about them; will you tell me a little more explicitly what is the principle of government which you would lay down?</div><div class="sentence"> You seem to imagine that a well-governed state ought to be so ordered as to conquer all other states in war:  am I right in supposing this to be your meaning?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly; and our Lacedaemonian friend, if I am not mistaken, will agree with me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Why, my good friend, how could any Lacedaemonian say anything else?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And is what you say applicable only to states, or also to villages?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  To both alike.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The case is the same?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And in the village will there be the same war of family against family, and of individual against individual?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  The same.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And should each man conceive himself to be his own enemy: —what shall we say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  O Athenian Stranger—inhabitant of Attica I will not call you, for you seem to deserve rather to be named after the goddess herself, because you go back to first principles,—you have thrown a light upon the argument, and will now be better able to understand what I was just saying,—that all men are publicly one another's enemies, and each man privately his own.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span> <div class="sentence">  (ATHENIAN: My good sir, what do you mean?</div><div class="sentence"> )—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence"> ...Moreover, there is a victory and defeat—the first and best of victories, the lowest and worst of defeats—which each man gains or sustains at the hands, not of another, but of himself; this shows that there is a war against ourselves going on within every one of us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us now reverse the order of the argument:  Seeing that every individual is either his own superior or his own inferior, may we say that there is the same principle in the house, the village, and the state?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  You mean that in each of them there is a principle of superiority or inferiority to self?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  You are quite right in asking the question, for there certainly is such a principle, and above all in states; and the state in which the better citizens win a victory over the mob and over the inferior classes may be truly said to be better than itself, and may be justly praised, where such a victory is gained, or censured in the opposite case.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Whether the better is ever really conquered by the worse, is a question which requires more discussion, and may be therefore left for the present.</div><div class="sentence"> But I now quite understand your meaning when you say that citizens who are of the same race and live in the same cities may unjustly conspire, and having the superiority in numbers may overcome and enslave the few just; and when they prevail, the state may be truly called its own inferior and therefore bad; and when they are defeated, its own superior and therefore good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Your remark, Stranger, is a paradox, and yet we cannot possibly deny it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Here is another case for consideration;—in a family there may be several brothers, who are the offspring of a single pair; very possibly the majority of them may be unjust, and the just may be in a minority.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very possibly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And you and I ought not to raise a question of words as to whether this family and household are rightly said to be superior when they conquer, and inferior when they are conquered; for we are not now considering what may or may not be the proper or customary way of speaking, but we are considering the natural principles of right and wrong in laws.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What you say, Stranger, is most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite excellent, in my opinion, as far as we have gone.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Again; might there not be a judge over these brethren, of whom we were speaking?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Now, which would be the better judge—one who destroyed the bad and appointed the good to govern themselves; or one who, while allowing the good to govern, let the bad live, and made them voluntarily submit?</div><div class="sentence"> Or third, I suppose, in the scale of excellence might be placed a judge, who, finding the family distracted, not only did not destroy any one, but reconciled them to one another for ever after, and gave them laws which they mutually observed, and was able to keep them friends.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  The last would be by far the best sort of judge and legislator.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">040</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And yet the aim of all the laws which he gave would be the reverse of war.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And will he who constitutes the state and orders the life of man have in view external war, or that kind of intestine war called civil, which no one, if he could prevent, would like to have occurring in his own state; and when occurring, every one would wish to be quit of as soon as possible?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">043</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  He would have the latter chiefly in view.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">044</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And would he prefer that this civil war should be terminated by the destruction of one of the parties, and by the victory of the other, or that peace and friendship should be re-established, and that, being reconciled, they should give their attention to foreign enemies?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Every one would desire the latter in the case of his own state.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">046</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And would not that also be the desire of the legislator?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">047</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">049</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">050</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But war, whether external or civil, is not the best, and the need of either is to be deprecated; but peace with one another, and good will, are best.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor is the victory of the state over itself to be regarded as a really good thing, but as a necessity; a man might as well say that the body was in the best state when sick and purged by medicine, forgetting that there is also a state of the body which needs no purge.</div><div class="sentence"> And in like manner no one can be a true statesman, whether he aims at the happiness of the individual or state, who looks only, or first of all, to external warfare; nor will he ever be a sound legislator who orders peace for the sake of war, and not war for the sake of peace.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose that there is truth, Stranger, in that remark of yours; and yet I am greatly mistaken if war is not the entire aim and object of our own institutions, and also of the Lacedaemonian.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I dare say; but there is no reason why we should rudely quarrel with one another about your legislators, instead of gently questioning them, seeing that both we and they are equally in earnest.</div><div class="sentence"> Please follow me and the argument closely: —And first I will put forward Tyrtaeus, an Athenian by birth, but also a Spartan citizen, who of all men was most eager about war:  Well, he says,</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span> <div class="sentence">  even if he were the richest of men, and possessed every good (and then he gives a whole list of them), if he be not at all times a brave warrior.'</div><div class="sentence"> I imagine that you, too, must have heard his poems; our Lacedaemonian friend has probably heard more than enough of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  And they have found their way from Lacedaemon to Crete.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Come now and let us all join in asking this question of Tyrtaeus:  O most divine poet, we will say to him, the excellent praise which you have bestowed on those who excel in war sufficiently proves that you are wise and good, and I and Megillus and Cleinias of Cnosus do, as I believe, entirely agree with you.</div><div class="sentence"> But we should like to be quite sure that we are speaking of the same men; tell us, then, do you agree with us in thinking that there are two kinds of war; or what would you say?</div><div class="sentence"> A far inferior man to Tyrtaeus would have no difficulty in replying quite truly, that war is of two kinds,—one which is universally called civil war, and is, as we were just now saying, of all wars the worst; the other, as we should all admit, in which we fall out with other nations who are of a different race, is a far milder form of warfare.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly, far milder.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Well, now, when you praise and blame war in this high-flown strain, whom are you praising or blaming, and to which kind of war are you referring?</div><div class="sentence"> I suppose that you must mean foreign war, if I am to judge from expressions of yours in which you say that you abominate those</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span> <div class="sentence">  'Who refuse to look upon fields of blood, and will not draw near and strike at their enemies.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span> <div class="sentence">  And we shall naturally go on to say to him,—You, Tyrtaeus, as it seems, praise those who distinguish themselves in external and foreign war; and he must admit this.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Evidently.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  They are good; but we say that there are still better men whose virtue is displayed in the greatest of all battles.</div><div class="sentence"> And we too have a poet whom we summon as a witness, Theognis, citizen of Megara in Sicily:</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span> <div class="sentence">  'Cyrnus,' he says, 'he who is faithful in a civil broil is worth his weight in gold and silver.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span> <div class="sentence">  And such an one is far better, as we affirm, than the other in a more difficult kind of war, much in the same degree as justice and temperance and wisdom, when united with courage, are better than courage only; for a man cannot be faithful and good in civil strife without having all virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> But in the war of which Tyrtaeus speaks, many a mercenary soldier will take his stand and be ready to die at his post, and yet they are generally and almost without exception insolent, unjust, violent men, and the most senseless of human beings.</div><div class="sentence"> You will ask what the conclusion is, and what I am seeking to prove: I maintain that the divine legislator of Crete, like any other who is worthy of consideration, will always and above all things in making laws have regard to the greatest virtue; which, according to Theognis, is loyalty in the hour of danger, and may be truly called perfect justice.</div><div class="sentence"> Whereas, that virtue which Tyrtaeus highly praises is well enough, and was praised by the poet at the right time, yet in place and dignity may be said to be only fourth rate (i.e., it ranks after justice, temperance, and wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> ).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Stranger, we are degrading our inspired lawgiver to a rank which is far beneath him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Nay, I think that we degrade not him but ourselves, if we imagine that Lycurgus and Minos laid down laws both in Lacedaemon and Crete mainly with a view to war.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What ought we to say then?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  What truth and what justice require of us, if I am not mistaken, when speaking in behalf of divine excellence;—that the legislator when making his laws had in view not a part only, and this the lowest part of virtue, but all virtue, and that he devised classes of laws answering to the kinds of virtue; not in the way in which modern inventors of laws make the classes, for they only investigate and offer laws whenever a want is felt, and one man has a class of laws about allotments and heiresses, another about assaults; others about ten thousand other such matters.</div><div class="sentence"> But we maintain that the right way of examining into laws is to proceed as we have now done, and I admired the spirit of your exposition; for you were quite right in beginning with virtue, and saying that this was the aim of the giver of the law, but I thought that you went wrong when you added that all his legislation had a view only to a part, and the least part of virtue, and this called forth my subsequent remarks.</div><div class="sentence"> Will you allow me then to explain how I should have liked to have heard you expound the matter?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  You ought to have said, Stranger—The Cretan laws are with reason famous among the Hellenes; for they fulfil the object of laws, which is to make those who use them happy; and they confer every sort of good.</div><div class="sentence"> Now goods are of two kinds:  there are human and there are divine goods, and the human hang upon the divine; and the state which attains the greater, at the same time acquires the less, or, not having the greater, has neither.</div><div class="sentence"> Of the lesser goods the first is health, the second beauty, the third strength, including swiftness in running and bodily agility generally, and the fourth is wealth, not the blind god (Pluto), but one who is keen of sight, if only he has wisdom for his companion.</div><div class="sentence"> For wisdom is chief and leader of the divine class of goods, and next follows temperance; and from the union of these two with courage springs justice, and fourth in the scale of virtue is courage.</div><div class="sentence"> All these naturally take precedence of the other goods, and this is the order in which the legislator must place them, and after them he will enjoin the rest of his ordinances on the citizens with a view to these, the human looking to the divine, and the divine looking to their leader mind.</div><div class="sentence"> Some of his ordinances will relate to contracts of marriage which they make one with another, and then to the procreation and education of children, both male and female; the duty of the lawgiver will be to take charge of his citizens, in youth and age, and at every time of life, and to give them punishments and rewards; and in reference to all their intercourse with one another, he ought to consider their pains and pleasures and desires, and the vehemence of all their passions; he should keep a watch over them, and blame and praise them rightly by the mouth of the laws themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> Also with regard to anger and terror, and the other perturbations of the soul, which arise out of misfortune, and the deliverances from them which prosperity brings, and the experiences which come to men in diseases, or in war, or poverty, or the opposite of these; in all these states he should determine and teach what is the good and evil of the condition of each.</div><div class="sentence"> In the next place, the legislator has to be careful how the citizens make their money and in what way they spend it, and to have an eye to their mutual contracts and dissolutions of contracts, whether voluntary or involuntary:  he should see how they order all this, and consider where justice as well as injustice is found or is wanting in their several dealings with one another; and honour those who obey the law, and impose fixed penalties on those who disobey, until the round of civil life is ended, and the time has come for the consideration of the proper funeral rites and honours of the dead.</div><div class="sentence"> And the lawgiver reviewing his work, will appoint guardians to preside over these things,—some who walk by intelligence, others by true opinion only, and then mind will bind together all his ordinances and show them to be in harmony with temperance and justice, and not with wealth or ambition.</div><div class="sentence"> This is the spirit, Stranger, in which I was and am desirous that you should pursue the subject.</div><div class="sentence"> And I want to know the nature of all these things, and how they are arranged in the laws of Zeus, as they are termed, and in those of the Pythian Apollo, which Minos and Lycurgus gave; and how the order of them is discovered to his eyes, who has experience in laws gained either by study or habit, although they are far from being self-evident to the rest of mankind like ourselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  How shall we proceed, Stranger?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I think that we must begin again as before, and first consider the habit of courage; and then we will go on and discuss another and then another form of virtue, if you please.</div><div class="sentence"> In this way we shall have a model of the whole; and with these and similar discourses we will beguile the way.</div><div class="sentence"> And when we have gone through all the virtues, we will show, by the grace of God, that the institutions of which I was speaking look to virtue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good; and suppose that you first criticize this praiser of Zeus and the laws of Crete.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">074</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I will try to criticize you and myself, as well as him, for the argument is a common concern.</div><div class="sentence"> Tell me,—were not first the syssitia, and secondly the gymnasia, invented by your legislator with a view to war?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">076</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And what comes third, and what fourth?</div><div class="sentence"> For that, I think, is the sort of enumeration which ought to be made of the remaining parts of virtue, no matter whether you call them parts or what their name is, provided the meaning is clear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Then I, or any other Lacedaemonian, would reply that hunting is third in order.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">078</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us see if we can discover what comes fourth and fifth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">079</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I think that I can get as far as the fourth head, which is the frequent endurance of pain, exhibited among us Spartans in certain hand-to-hand fights; also in stealing with the prospect of getting a good beating; there is, too, the so-called Crypteia, or secret service, in which wonderful endurance is shown,—our people wander over the whole country by day and by night, and even in winter have not a shoe to their foot, and are without beds to lie upon, and have to attend upon themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> Marvellous, too, is the endurance which our citizens show in their naked exercises, contending against the violent summer heat; and there are many similar practices, to speak of which in detail would be endless.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Excellent, O Lacedaemonian Stranger.</div><div class="sentence"> But how ought we to define courage?</div><div class="sentence"> Is it to be regarded only as a combat against fears and pains, or also against desires and pleasures, and against flatteries; which exercise such a tremendous power, that they make the hearts even of respectable citizens to melt like wax?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">081</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should say the latter.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">082</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  In what preceded, as you will remember, our Cnosian friend was speaking of a man or a city being inferior to themselves: —Were you not, Cleinias?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">083</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I was.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">084</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Now, which is in the truest sense inferior, the man who is overcome by pleasure or by pain?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">085</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I should say the man who is overcome by pleasure; for all men deem him to be inferior in a more disgraceful sense, than the other who is overcome by pain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">086</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But surely the lawgivers of Crete and Lacedaemon have not legislated for a courage which is lame of one leg, able only to meet attacks which come from the left, but impotent against the insidious flatteries which come from the right?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Able to meet both, I should say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">088</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then let me once more ask, what institutions have you in either of your states which give a taste of pleasures, and do not avoid them any more than they avoid pains; but which set a person in the midst of them, and compel or induce him by the prospect of reward to get the better of them?</div><div class="sentence"> Where is an ordinance about pleasure similar to that about pain to be found in your laws?</div><div class="sentence"> Tell me what there is of this nature among you: —What is there which makes your citizen equally brave against pleasure and pain, conquering what they ought to conquer, and superior to the enemies who are most dangerous and nearest home?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I was able to tell you, Stranger, many laws which were directed against pain; but I do not know that I can point out any great or obvious examples of similar institutions which are concerned with pleasure; there are some lesser provisions, however, which I might mention.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Neither can I show anything of that sort which is at all equally prominent in the Cretan laws.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  No wonder, my dear friends; and if, as is very likely, in our search after the true and good, one of us may have to censure the laws of the others, we must not be offended, but take kindly what another says.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  You are quite right, Athenian Stranger, and we will do as you say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">093</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  At our time of life, Cleinias, there should be no feeling of irritation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I will not at present determine whether he who censures the Cretan or Lacedaemonian polities is right or wrong.</div><div class="sentence"> But I believe that I can tell better than either of you what the many say about them.</div><div class="sentence"> For assuming that you have reasonably good laws, one of the best of them will be the law forbidding any young men to enquire which of them are right or wrong; but with one mouth and one voice they must all agree that the laws are all good, for they came from God; and any one who says the contrary is not to be listened to.</div><div class="sentence"> But an old man who remarks any defect in your laws may communicate his observation to a ruler or to an equal in years when no young man is present.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly so, Stranger; and like a diviner, although not there at the time, you seem to me quite to have hit the meaning of the legislator, and to say what is most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  As there are no young men present, and the legislator has given old men free licence, there will be no impropriety in our discussing these very matters now that we are alone.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">098</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore you may be as free as you like in your censure of our laws, for there is no discredit in knowing what is wrong; he who receives what is said in a generous and friendly spirit will be all the better for it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Very good; however, I am not going to say anything against your laws until to the best of my ability I have examined them, but I am going to raise doubts about them.</div><div class="sentence"> For you are the only people known to us, whether Greek or barbarian, whom the legislator commanded to eschew all great pleasures and amusements and never to touch them; whereas in the matter of pains or fears which we have just been discussing, he thought that they who from infancy had always avoided pains and fears and sorrows, when they were compelled to face them would run away from those who were hardened in them, and would become their subjects.</div><div class="sentence"> Now the legislator ought to have considered that this was equally true of pleasure; he should have said to himself, that if our citizens are from their youth upward unacquainted with the greatest pleasures, and unused to endure amid the temptations of pleasure, and are not disciplined to refrain from all things evil, the sweet feeling of pleasure will overcome them just as fear would overcome the former class; and in another, and even a worse manner, they will be the slaves of those who are able to endure amid pleasures, and have had the opportunity of enjoying them, they being often the worst of mankind.</div><div class="sentence"> One half of their souls will be a slave, the other half free; and they will not be worthy to be called in the true sense men and freemen.</div><div class="sentence"> Tell me whether you assent to my words?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">100</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  On first hearing, what you say appears to be the truth; but to be hasty in coming to a conclusion about such important matters would be very childish and simple.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Suppose, Cleinias and Megillus, that we consider the virtue which follows next of those which we intended to discuss (for after courage comes temperance), what institutions shall we find relating to temperance, either in Crete or Lacedaemon, which, like your military institutions, differ from those of any ordinary state.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is not an easy question to answer; still I should say that the common meals and gymnastic exercises have been excellently devised for the promotion both of temperance and courage.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">103</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  There seems to be a difficulty, Stranger, with regard to states, in making words and facts coincide so that there can be no dispute about them.</div><div class="sentence"> As in the human body, the regimen which does good in one way does harm in another; and we can hardly say that any one course of treatment is adapted to a particular constitution.</div><div class="sentence"> Now the gymnasia and common meals do a great deal of good, and yet they are a source of evil in civil troubles; as is shown in the case of the Milesian, and Boeotian, and Thurian youth, among whom these institutions seem always to have had a tendency to degrade the ancient and natural custom of love below the level, not only of man, but of the beasts.</div><div class="sentence"> The charge may be fairly brought against your cities above all others, and is true also of most other states which especially cultivate gymnastics.</div><div class="sentence"> Whether such matters are to be regarded jestingly or seriously, I think that the pleasure is to be deemed natural which arises out of the intercourse between men and women; but that the intercourse of men with men, or of women with women, is contrary to nature, and that the bold attempt was originally due to unbridled lust.</div><div class="sentence"> The Cretans are always accused of having invented the story of Ganymede and Zeus because they wanted to justify themselves in the enjoyment of unnatural pleasures by the practice of the god whom they believe to have been their lawgiver.</div><div class="sentence"> Leaving the story, we may observe that any speculation about laws turns almost entirely on pleasure and pain, both in states and in individuals:  these are two fountains which nature lets flow, and he who draws from them where and when, and as much as he ought, is happy; and this holds of men and animals—of individuals as well as states; and he who indulges in them ignorantly and at the wrong time, is the reverse of happy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I admit, Stranger, that your words are well spoken, and I hardly know what to say in answer to you; but still I think that the Spartan lawgiver was quite right in forbidding pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> Of the Cretan laws, I shall leave the defence to my Cnosian friend.</div><div class="sentence"> But the laws of Sparta, in as far as they relate to pleasure, appear to me to be the best in the world; for that which leads mankind in general into the wildest pleasure and licence, and every other folly, the law has clean driven out; and neither in the country nor in towns which are under the control of Sparta, will you find revelries and the many incitements of every kind of pleasure which accompany them; and any one who meets a drunken and disorderly person, will immediately have him most severely punished, and will not let him off on any pretence, not even at the time of a Dionysiac festival; although I have remarked that this may happen at your performances 'on the cart,' as they are called; and among our Tarentine colonists I have seen the whole city drunk at a Dionysiac festival; but nothing of the sort happens among us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  O Lacedaemonian Stranger, these festivities are praiseworthy where there is a spirit of endurance, but are very senseless when they are under no regulations.</div><div class="sentence"> In order to retaliate, an Athenian has only to point out the licence which exists among your women.</div><div class="sentence"> To all such accusations, whether they are brought against the Tarentines, or us, or you, there is one answer which exonerates the practice in question from impropriety.</div><div class="sentence"> When a stranger expresses wonder at the singularity of what he sees, any inhabitant will naturally answer him: —Wonder not, O stranger; this is our custom, and you may very likely have some other custom about the same things.</div><div class="sentence"> Now we are speaking, my friends, not about men in general, but about the merits and defects of the lawgivers themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us then discourse a little more at length about intoxication, which is a very important subject, and will seriously task the discrimination of the legislator.</div><div class="sentence"> I am not speaking of drinking, or not drinking, wine at all, but of intoxication.</div><div class="sentence"> Are we to follow the custom of the Scythians, and Persians, and Carthaginians, and Celts, and Iberians, and Thracians, who are all warlike nations, or that of your countrymen, for they, as you say, altogether abstain?</div><div class="sentence"> But the Scythians and Thracians, both men and women, drink unmixed wine, which they pour on their garments, and this they think a happy and glorious institution.</div><div class="sentence"> The Persians, again, are much given to other practices of luxury which you reject, but they have more moderation in them than the Thracians and Scythians.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  O best of men, we have only to take arms into our hands, and we send all these nations flying before us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Nay, my good friend, do not say that; there have been, as there always will be, flights and pursuits of which no account can be given, and therefore we cannot say that victory or defeat in battle affords more than a doubtful proof of the goodness or badness of institutions.</div><div class="sentence"> For when the greater states conquer and enslave the lesser, as the Syracusans have done the Locrians, who appear to be the best-governed people in their part of the world, or as the Athenians have done the Ceans (and there are ten thousand other instances of the same sort of thing), all this is not to the point; let us endeavour rather to form a conclusion about each institution in itself and say nothing, at present, of victories and defeats.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us only say that such and such a custom is honourable, and another not.</div><div class="sentence"> And first permit me to tell you how good and bad are to be estimated in reference to these very matters.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  How do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">109</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  All those who are ready at a moment's notice to praise or censure any practice which is matter of discussion, seem to me to proceed in a wrong way.</div><div class="sentence"> Let me give you an illustration of what I mean: —You may suppose a person to be praising wheat as a good kind of food, whereupon another person instantly blames wheat, without ever enquiring into its effect or use, or in what way, or to whom, or with what, or in what state and how, wheat is to be given.</div><div class="sentence"> And that is just what we are doing in this discussion.</div><div class="sentence"> At the very mention of the word intoxication, one side is ready with their praises and the other with their censures; which is absurd.</div><div class="sentence"> For either side adduce their witnesses and approvers, and some of us think that we speak with authority because we have many witnesses; and others because they see those who abstain conquering in battle, and this again is disputed by us.</div><div class="sentence"> Now I cannot say that I shall be satisfied, if we go on discussing each of the remaining laws in the same way.</div><div class="sentence"> And about this very point of intoxication I should like to speak in another way, which I hold to be the right one; for if number is to be the criterion, are there not myriads upon myriads of nations ready to dispute the point with you, who are only two cities?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I shall gladly welcome any method of enquiry which is right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">111</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let me put the matter thus: —Suppose a person to praise the keeping of goats, and the creatures themselves as capital things to have, and then some one who had seen goats feeding without a goatherd in cultivated spots, and doing mischief, were to censure a goat or any other animal who has no keeper, or a bad keeper, would there be any sense or justice in such censure?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">112</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">113</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Does a captain require only to have nautical knowledge in order to be a good captain, whether he is sea-sick or not?</div><div class="sentence"> What do you say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">114</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I say that he is not a good captain if, although he have nautical skill, he is liable to sea-sickness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">115</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And what would you say of the commander of an army?</div><div class="sentence"> Will he be able to command merely because he has military skill if he be a coward, who, when danger comes, is sick and drunk with fear?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">116</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">117</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And what if besides being a coward he has no skill?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">118</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  He is a miserable fellow, not fit to be a commander of men, but only of old women.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">119</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And what would you say of some one who blames or praises any sort of meeting which is intended by nature to have a ruler, and is well enough when under his presidency?</div><div class="sentence"> The critic, however, has never seen the society meeting together at an orderly feast under the control of a president, but always without a ruler or with a bad one: —when observers of this class praise or blame such meetings, are we to suppose that what they say is of any value?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">120</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not, if they have never seen or been present at such a meeting when rightly ordered.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">121</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Reflect; may not banqueters and banquets be said to constitute a kind of meeting?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">122</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">123</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And did any one ever see this sort of convivial meeting rightly ordered?</div><div class="sentence"> Of course you two will answer that you have never seen them at all, because they are not customary or lawful in your country; but I have come across many of them in many different places, and moreover I have made enquiries about them wherever I went, as I may say, and never did I see or hear of anything of the kind which was carried on altogether rightly; in some few particulars they might be right, but in general they were utterly wrong.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">124</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean, Stranger, by this remark?</div><div class="sentence"> Explain.</div><div class="sentence"> For we, as you say, from our inexperience in such matters, might very likely not know, even if they came in our way, what was right or wrong in such societies.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">125</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Likely enough; then let me try to be your instructor:  You would acknowledge, would you not, that in all gatherings of mankind, of whatever sort, there ought to be a leader?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">126</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly I should.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">127</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And we were saying just now, that when men are at war the leader ought to be a brave man?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">128</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  We were.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">129</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The brave man is less likely than the coward to be disturbed by fears?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">130</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That again is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">131</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And if there were a possibility of having a general of an army who was absolutely fearless and imperturbable, should we not by all means appoint him?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">132</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Assuredly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">133</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Now, however, we are speaking not of a general who is to command an army, when foe meets foe in time of war, but of one who is to regulate meetings of another sort, when friend meets friend in time of peace.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">134</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">135</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And that sort of meeting, if attended with drunkenness, is apt to be unquiet.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">136</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly; the reverse of quiet.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">137</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  In the first place, then, the revellers as well as the soldiers will require a ruler?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">138</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure; no men more so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">139</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And we ought, if possible, to provide them with a quiet ruler?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">140</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">141</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And he should be a man who understands society; for his duty is to preserve the friendly feelings which exist among the company at the time, and to increase them for the future by his use of the occasion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">142</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">143</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Must we not appoint a sober man and a wise to be our master of the revels?</div><div class="sentence"> For if the ruler of drinkers be himself young and drunken, and not over-wise, only by some special good fortune will he be saved from doing some great evil.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">144</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  It will be by a singular good fortune that he is saved.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">145</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Now suppose such associations to be framed in the best way possible in states, and that some one blames the very fact of their existence—he may very likely be right.</div><div class="sentence"> But if he blames a practice which he only sees very much mismanaged, he shows in the first place that he is not aware of the mismanagement, and also not aware that everything done in this way will turn out to be wrong, because done without the superintendence of a sober ruler.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you not see that a drunken pilot or a drunken ruler of any sort will ruin ship, chariot, army—anything, in short, of which he has the direction?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">146</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  The last remark is very true, Stranger; and I see quite clearly the advantage of an army having a good leader—he will give victory in war to his followers, which is a very great advantage; and so of other things.</div><div class="sentence"> But I do not see any similar advantage which either individuals or states gain from the good management of a feast; and I want you to tell me what great good will be effected, supposing that this drinking ordinance is duly established.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">147</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  If you mean to ask what great good accrues to the state from the right training of a single youth, or of a single chorus—when the question is put in that form, we cannot deny that the good is not very great in any particular instance.</div><div class="sentence"> But if you ask what is the good of education in general, the answer is easy—that education makes good men, and that good men act nobly, and conquer their enemies in battle, because they are good.</div><div class="sentence"> Education certainly gives victory, although victory sometimes produces forgetfulness of education; for many have grown insolent from victory in war, and this insolence has engendered in them innumerable evils; and many a victory has been and will be suicidal to the victors; but education is never suicidal.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">148</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  You seem to imply, my friend, that convivial meetings, when rightly ordered, are an important element of education.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">149</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly I do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">150</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  And can you show that what you have been saying is true?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">151</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  To be absolutely sure of the truth of matters concerning which there are many opinions, is an attribute of the Gods not given to man, Stranger; but I shall be very happy to tell you what I think, especially as we are now proposing to enter on a discussion concerning laws and constitutions.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">152</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Your opinion, Stranger, about the questions which are now being raised, is precisely what we want to hear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">153</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Very good; I will try to find a way of explaining my meaning, and you shall try to have the gift of understanding me.</div><div class="sentence"> But first let me make an apology.</div><div class="sentence"> The Athenian citizen is reputed among all the Hellenes to be a great talker, whereas Sparta is renowned for brevity, and the Cretans have more wit than words.</div><div class="sentence"> Now I am afraid of appearing to elicit a very long discourse out of very small materials.</div><div class="sentence"> For drinking indeed may appear to be a slight matter, and yet is one which cannot be rightly ordered according to nature, without correct principles of music; these are</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">154</span> <div class="sentence">  necessary to any clear or satisfactory treatment of the subject, and music again runs up into education generally, and there is much to be said about all this.</div><div class="sentence"> What would you say then to leaving these matters for the present, and passing on to some other question of law?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">155</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  O Athenian Stranger, let me tell you what perhaps you do not know, that our family is the proxenus of your state.</div><div class="sentence"> I imagine that from their earliest youth all boys, when they are told that they are the proxeni of a particular state, feel kindly towards their second country; and this has certainly been my own feeling.</div><div class="sentence"> I can well remember from the days of my boyhood, how, when any Lacedaemonians praised or blamed the Athenians, they used to say to me,—'See, Megillus, how ill or how well,' as the case might be, 'has your state treated us'; and having always had to fight your battles against detractors when I heard you assailed, I became warmly attached to you.</div><div class="sentence"> And I always like to hear the Athenian tongue spoken; the common saying is quite true, that a good Athenian is more than ordinarily good, for he is the only man who is freely and genuinely good by the divine inspiration of his own nature, and is not manufactured.</div><div class="sentence"> Therefore be assured that I shall like to hear you say whatever you have to say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">156</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Stranger; and when you have heard me speak, say boldly what is in your thoughts.</div><div class="sentence"> Let me remind you of a tie which unites you to Crete.</div><div class="sentence"> You must have heard here the story of the prophet Epimenides, who was of my family, and came to Athens ten years before the Persian war, in accordance with the response of the Oracle, and offered certain sacrifices which the God commanded.</div><div class="sentence"> The Athenians were at that time in dread of the Persian invasion; and he said that for ten years they would not come, and that when they came, they would go away again without accomplishing any of their objects, and would suffer more evil than they inflicted.</div><div class="sentence"> At that time my forefathers formed ties of hospitality with you; thus ancient is the friendship which I and my parents have had for you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">157</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  You seem to be quite ready to listen; and I am also ready to perform as much as I can of an almost impossible task, which I will nevertheless attempt.</div><div class="sentence"> At the outset of the discussion, let me define the nature and power of education; for this is the way by which our argument must travel onwards to the God Dionysus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">158</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Let us proceed, if you please.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">159</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, if I tell you what are my notions of education, will you consider whether they satisfy you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">160</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Let us hear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">161</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  According to my view, any one who would be good at anything must practise that thing from his youth upwards, both in sport and earnest, in its several branches:  for example, he who is to be a good builder, should play at building children's houses; he who is to be a good husbandman, at tilling the ground; and those who have the care of their education should provide them when young with mimic tools.</div><div class="sentence"> They should learn beforehand the knowledge which they will afterwards require for their art.</div><div class="sentence"> For example, the future carpenter should learn to measure or apply the line in play; and the future warrior should learn riding, or some other exercise, for amusement, and the teacher should endeavour to direct the children's inclinations and pleasures, by the help of amusements, to their final aim in life.</div><div class="sentence"> The most important part of education is right training in the nursery.</div><div class="sentence"> The soul of the child in his play should be guided to the love of that sort of excellence in which when he grows up to manhood he will have to be perfected.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you agree with me thus far?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">162</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">163</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then let us not leave the meaning of education ambiguous or ill-defined.</div><div class="sentence"> At present, when we speak in terms of praise or blame about the bringing-up of each person, we call one man educated and another uneducated, although the uneducated man may be sometimes very well educated for the calling of a retail trader, or of a captain of a ship, and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> For we are not speaking of education in this narrower sense, but of that other education in virtue from youth upwards, which makes a man eagerly pursue the ideal perfection of citizenship, and teaches him how rightly to rule and how to obey.</div><div class="sentence"> This is the only education which, upon our view, deserves the name; that other sort of training, which aims at the acquisition of wealth or bodily strength, or mere cleverness apart from intelligence and justice, is mean and illiberal, and is not worthy to be called education at all.</div><div class="sentence"> But let us not quarrel with one another about a word, provided that the proposition which has just been granted hold good:  to wit, that those who are rightly educated generally become good men.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither must we cast a slight upon education, which is the first and fairest thing that the best of men can ever have, and which, though liable to take a wrong direction, is capable of reformation.</div><div class="sentence"> And this work of reformation is the great business of every man while he lives.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">164</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true; and we entirely agree with you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">165</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And we agreed before that they are good men who are able to rule themselves, and bad men who are not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">166</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  You are quite right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">167</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let me now proceed, if I can, to clear up the subject a little further by an illustration which I will offer you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">168</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Proceed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">169</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Do we not consider each of ourselves to be one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">170</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  We do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">171</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And each one of us has in his bosom two counsellors, both foolish and also antagonistic; of which we call the one pleasure, and the other pain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">172</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">173</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Also there are opinions about the future, which have the general name of expectations; and the specific name of fear, when the expectation is of pain; and of hope, when of pleasure; and further, there is reflection about the good or evil of them, and this, when embodied in a decree by the State, is called Law.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">174</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I am hardly able to follow you; proceed, however, as if I were.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">175</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I am in the like case.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">176</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us look at the matter thus:  May we not conceive each of us living beings to be a puppet of the Gods, either their plaything only, or created with a purpose—which of the two we cannot certainly know?</div><div class="sentence"> But we do know, that these affections in us are like cords and strings, which pull us different and opposite ways, and to opposite actions; and herein lies the difference between virtue and vice.</div><div class="sentence"> According to the argument there is one among these cords which every man ought to grasp and never let go, but to pull with it against all the rest; and this is the sacred and golden cord of reason, called by us the common law of the State; there are others which are hard and of iron, but this one is soft because golden; and there are several other kinds.</div><div class="sentence"> Now we ought always to cooperate with the lead of the best, which is law.</div><div class="sentence"> For inasmuch as reason is beautiful and gentle, and not violent, her rule must needs have ministers in order to help the golden principle in vanquishing the other principles.</div><div class="sentence"> And thus the moral of the tale about our being puppets will not have been lost, and the meaning of the expression 'superior or inferior to a man's self' will become clearer; and the individual, attaining to right reason in this matter of pulling the strings of the puppet, should live according to its rule; while the city, receiving the same from some god or from one who has knowledge of these things, should embody it in a law, to be her guide in her dealings with herself and with other states.</div><div class="sentence"> In this way virtue and vice will be more clearly distinguished by us.</div><div class="sentence"> And when they have become clearer, education and other institutions will in like manner become clearer; and in particular that question of convivial entertainment, which may seem, perhaps, to have been a very trifling matter, and to have taken a great many more words than were necessary.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">177</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Perhaps, however, the theme may turn out not to be unworthy of the length of discourse.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">178</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Very good; let us proceed with any enquiry which really bears on our present object.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">179</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Proceed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">180</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Suppose that we give this puppet of ours drink,—what will be the effect on him?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">181</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Having what in view do you ask that question?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">182</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Nothing as yet; but I ask generally, when the puppet is brought to the drink, what sort of result is likely to follow.</div><div class="sentence"> I will endeavour to explain my meaning more clearly:  what I am now asking is this—Does the drinking of wine heighten and increase pleasures and pains, and passions and loves?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">183</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very greatly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">184</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And are perception and memory, and opinion and prudence, heightened and increased?</div><div class="sentence"> Do not these qualities entirely desert a man if he becomes saturated with drink?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">185</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, they entirely desert him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">186</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Does he not return to the state of soul in which he was when a young child?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">187</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  He does.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">188</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then at that time he will have the least control over himself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">189</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  The least.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">190</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And will he not be in a most wretched plight?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">191</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Most wretched.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">192</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then not only an old man but also a drunkard becomes a second time a child?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">193</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Well said, Stranger.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">194</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Is there any argument which will prove to us that we ought to encourage the taste for drinking instead of doing all we can to avoid it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">195</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose that there is; you at any rate, were just now saying that you were ready to maintain such a doctrine.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">196</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  True, I was; and I am ready still, seeing that you have both declared that you are anxious to hear me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">197</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure we are, if only for the strangeness of the paradox, which asserts that a man ought of his own accord to plunge into utter degradation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">198</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Are you speaking of the soul?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">199</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">200</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And what would you say about the body, my friend?</div><div class="sentence"> Are you not surprised at any one of his own accord bringing upon himself deformity, leanness, ugliness, decrepitude?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">201</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">202</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yet when a man goes of his own accord to a doctor's shop, and takes medicine, is he not aware that soon, and for many days afterwards, he will be in a state of body which he would die rather than accept as the permanent condition of his life?</div><div class="sentence"> Are not those who train in gymnasia, at first beginning reduced to a state of weakness?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">203</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, all that is well known.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">204</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Also that they go of their own accord for the sake of the subsequent benefit?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">205</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">206</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And we may conceive this to be true in the same way of other practices?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">207</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">208</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And the same view may be taken of the pastime of drinking wine, if we are right in supposing that the same good effect follows?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">209</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">210</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  If such convivialities should turn out to have any advantage equal in importance to that of gymnastic, they are in their very nature to be preferred to mere bodily exercise, inasmuch as they have no accompaniment of pain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">211</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True; but I hardly think that we shall be able to discover any such benefits to be derived from them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">212</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  That is just what we must endeavour to show.</div><div class="sentence"> And let me ask you a question: —Do we not distinguish two kinds of fear, which are very different?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">213</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What are they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">214</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  There is the fear of expected evil.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">215</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">216</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And there is the fear of an evil reputation; we are afraid of being thought evil, because we do or say some dishonourable thing, which fear we and all men term shame.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">217</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">218</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  These are the two fears, as I called them; one of which is the opposite of pain and other fears, and the opposite also of the greatest and most numerous sort of pleasures.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">219</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">220</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And does not the legislator and every one who is good for anything, hold this fear in the greatest honour?</div><div class="sentence"> This is what he terms reverence, and the confidence which is the reverse of this he terms insolence; and the latter he always deems to be a very great evil both to individuals and to states.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">221</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">222</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Does not this kind of fear preserve us in many important ways?</div><div class="sentence"> What is there which so surely gives victory and safety in war?</div><div class="sentence"> For there are two things which give victory—confidence before enemies, and fear of disgrace before friends.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">223</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  There are.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">224</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then each of us should be fearless and also fearful; and why we should be either has now been determined.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">225</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">226</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And when we want to make any one fearless, we and the law bring him face to face with many fears.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">227</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">228</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And when we want to make him rightly fearful, must we not introduce him to shameless pleasures, and train him to take up arms against them, and to overcome them?</div><div class="sentence"> Or does this principle apply to courage only, and must he who would be perfect in valour fight against and overcome his own natural character,—since if he be unpractised and inexperienced in such conflicts, he will not be half the man which he might have been,—and are we to suppose, that with temperance it is otherwise, and that he who has never fought with the shameless and unrighteous temptations of his pleasures and lusts, and conquered them, in earnest and in play, by word, deed, and act, will still be perfectly temperate?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">229</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  A most unlikely supposition.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">230</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Suppose that some God had given a fear-potion to men, and that the more a man drank of this the more he regarded himself at every draught as a child of misfortune, and that he feared everything happening or about to happen to him; and that at last the most courageous of men utterly lost his presence of mind for a time, and only came to himself again when he had slept off the influence of the draught.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">231</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  But has such a draught, Stranger, ever really been known among men?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">232</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  No; but, if there had been, might not such a draught have been of use to the legislator as a test of courage?</div><div class="sentence"> Might we not go and say to him, 'O legislator, whether you are legislating for the Cretan, or for any other state, would you not like to have a touchstone of the courage and cowardice of your citizens?'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">233</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  'I should,' will be the answer of every one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">234</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  'And you would rather have a touchstone in which there is no risk and no great danger than the reverse?'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">235</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  In that proposition every one may safely agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">236</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  'And in order to make use of the draught, you would lead them amid these imaginary terrors, and prove them, when the affection of fear was working upon them, and compel them to be fearless, exhorting and admonishing them; and also honouring them, but dishonouring any one who will not be persuaded by you to be in all respects such as you command him; and if he underwent the trial well and manfully, you would let him go unscathed; but if ill, you would inflict a punishment upon him?</div><div class="sentence"> Or would you abstain from using the potion altogether, although you have no reason for abstaining?'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">237</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  He would be certain, Stranger, to use the potion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">238</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  This would be a mode of testing and training which would be wonderfully easy in comparison with those now in use, and might be applied to a single person, or to a few, or indeed to any number; and he would do well who provided himself with the potion only, rather than with any number of other things, whether he preferred to be by himself in solitude, and there contend with his fears, because he was ashamed to be seen by the eye of man until he was perfect; or trusting to the force of his own nature and habits, and believing that he had been already disciplined sufficiently, he did not hesitate to train himself in company with any number of others, and display his power in conquering the irresistible change effected by the draught—his virtue being such, that he never in any instance fell into any great unseemliness, but was always himself, and left off before he arrived at the last cup, fearing that he, like all other men, might be overcome by the potion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">239</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Stranger, in that last case, too, he might equally show his self-control.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">240</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us return to the lawgiver, and say to him: —'Well, lawgiver, there is certainly no such fear-potion which man has either received from the Gods or himself discovered; for witchcraft has no place at our board.</div><div class="sentence"> But is there any potion which might serve as a test of overboldness and excessive and indiscreet boasting?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">241</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose that he will say, Yes,—meaning that wine is such a potion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">242</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Is not the effect of this quite the opposite of the effect of the other?</div><div class="sentence"> When a man drinks wine he begins to be better pleased with himself, and the more he drinks the more he is filled full of brave hopes, and conceit of his power, and at last the string of his tongue is loosened, and fancying himself wise, he is brimming over with lawlessness, and has no more fear or respect, and is ready to do or say anything.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">243</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I think that every one will admit the truth of your description.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">244</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">245</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Now, let us remember, as we were saying, that there are two things which should be cultivated in the soul:  first, the greatest courage; secondly, the greatest fear—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">246</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Which you said to be characteristic of reverence, if I am not mistaken.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">247</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Thank you for reminding me.</div><div class="sentence"> But now, as the habit of courage and fearlessness is to be trained amid fears, let us consider whether the opposite quality is not also to be trained among opposites.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">248</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That is probably the case.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">249</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  There are times and seasons at which we are by nature more than commonly valiant and bold; now we ought to train ourselves on these occasions to be as free from impudence and shamelessness as possible, and to be afraid to say or suffer or do anything that is base.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">250</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">251</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Are not the moments in which we are apt to be bold and shameless such as these?—when we are under the influence of anger, love, pride, ignorance, avarice, cowardice?</div><div class="sentence"> or when wealth, beauty, strength, and all the intoxicating workings of pleasure madden us?</div><div class="sentence"> What is better adapted than the festive use of wine, in the first place to test, and in the second place to train the character of a man, if care be taken in the use of it?</div><div class="sentence"> What is there cheaper, or more innocent?</div><div class="sentence"> For do but consider which is the greater risk: —Would you rather test a man of a morose and savage nature, which is the source of ten thousand acts of injustice, by making bargains with him at a risk to yourself, or by having him as a companion at the festival of Dionysus?</div><div class="sentence"> Or would you, if you wanted to apply a touchstone to a man who is prone to love, entrust your wife, or your sons, or daughters to him, perilling your dearest interests in order to have a view of the condition of his soul?</div><div class="sentence"> I might mention numberless cases, in which the advantage would be manifest of getting to know a character in sport, and without paying dearly for experience.</div><div class="sentence"> And I do not believe that either a Cretan, or any other man, will doubt that such a test is a fair test, and safer, cheaper, and speedier than any other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">252</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That is certainly true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">253</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And this knowledge of the natures and habits of men's souls will be of the greatest use in that art which has the management of them; and that art, if I am not mistaken, is politics.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">254</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly so.</div></div>

<h2>BOOK II.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And now we have to consider whether the insight into human nature is the only benefit derived from well-ordered potations, or whether there are not other advantages great and much to be desired.</div><div class="sentence"> The argument seems to imply that there are.</div><div class="sentence"> But how and in what way these are to be attained, will have to be considered attentively, or we may be entangled in error.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Proceed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let me once more recall our doctrine of right education; which, if I am not mistaken, depends on the due regulation of convivial intercourse.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  You talk rather grandly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Pleasure and pain I maintain to be the first perceptions of children, and I say that they are the forms under which virtue and vice are originally present to them.</div><div class="sentence"> As to wisdom and true and fixed opinions, happy is the man who acquires them, even when declining in years; and we may say that he who possesses them, and the blessings which are contained in them, is a perfect man.</div><div class="sentence"> Now I mean by education that training which is given by suitable habits to the first instincts of virtue in children;—when pleasure, and friendship, and pain, and hatred, are rightly implanted in souls not yet capable of understanding the nature of them, and who find them, after they have attained reason, to be in harmony with her.</div><div class="sentence"> This harmony of the soul, taken as a whole, is virtue; but the particular training in respect of pleasure and pain, which leads you always to hate what you ought to hate, and love what you ought to love from the beginning of life to the end, may be separated off; and, in my view, will be rightly called education.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I think, Stranger, that you are quite right in all that you have said and are saying about education.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I am glad to hear that you agree with me; for, indeed, the discipline of pleasure and pain which, when rightly ordered, is a principle of education, has been often relaxed and corrupted in human life.</div><div class="sentence"> And the Gods, pitying the toils which our race is born to undergo, have appointed holy festivals, wherein men alternate rest with labour; and have given them the Muses and Apollo, the leader of the Muses, and Dionysus, to be companions in their revels, that they may improve their education by taking part in the festivals of the Gods, and with their help.</div><div class="sentence"> I should like to know whether a common saying is in our opinion true to nature or not.</div><div class="sentence"> For men say that the young of all creatures cannot be quiet in their bodies or in their voices; they are always wanting to move and cry out; some leaping and skipping, and overflowing with sportiveness and delight at something, others uttering all sorts of cries.</div><div class="sentence"> But, whereas the animals have no perception of order or disorder in their movements, that is, of rhythm or harmony, as they are called, to us, the Gods, who, as we say, have been appointed to be our companions in the dance, have given the pleasurable sense of harmony and rhythm; and so they stir us into life, and we follow them, joining hands together in dances and songs; and these they call choruses, which is a term naturally expressive of cheerfulness.</div><div class="sentence"> Shall we begin, then, with the acknowledgment that education is first given through Apollo and the Muses?</div><div class="sentence"> What do you say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I assent.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And the uneducated is he who has not been trained in the chorus, and the educated is he who has been well trained?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And the chorus is made up of two parts, dance and song?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then he who is well educated will be able to sing and dance well?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose that he will.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us see; what are we saying?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  He sings well and dances well; now must we add that he sings what is good and dances what is good?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Let us make the addition.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  We will suppose that he knows the good to be good, and the bad to be bad, and makes use of them accordingly:  which now is the better trained in dancing and music—he who is able to move his body and to use his voice in what is understood to be the right manner, but has no delight in good or hatred of evil; or he who is incorrect in gesture and voice, but is right in his sense of pleasure and pain, and welcomes what is good, and is offended at what is evil?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  There is a great difference, Stranger, in the two kinds of education.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  If we three know what is good in song and dance, then we truly know also who is educated and who is uneducated; but if not, then we certainly shall not know wherein lies the safeguard of education, and whether there is any or not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us follow the scent like hounds, and go in pursuit of beauty of figure, and melody, and song, and dance; if these escape us, there will be no use in talking about true education, whether Hellenic or barbarian.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And what is beauty of figure, or beautiful melody?</div><div class="sentence"> When a manly soul is in trouble, and when a cowardly soul is in similar case, are they likely to use the same figures and gestures, or to give utterance to the same sounds?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  How can they, when the very colours of their faces differ?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Good, my friend; I may observe, however, in passing, that in music there certainly are figures and there are melodies:  and music is concerned with harmony and rhythm, so that you may speak of a melody or figure having good rhythm or good harmony—the term is correct enough; but to speak metaphorically of a melody or figure having a 'good colour,' as the masters of choruses do, is not allowable, although you can speak of the melodies or figures of the brave and the coward, praising the one and censuring the other.</div><div class="sentence"> And not to be tedious, let us say that the figures and melodies which are expressive of virtue of soul or body, or of images of virtue, are without exception good, and those which are expressive of vice are the reverse of good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Your suggestion is excellent; and let us answer that these things are so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Once more, are all of us equally delighted with every sort of dance?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Far otherwise.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  What, then, leads us astray?</div><div class="sentence"> Are beautiful things not the same to us all, or are they the same in themselves, but not in our opinion of them?</div><div class="sentence"> For no one will admit that forms of vice in the dance are more beautiful than forms of virtue, or that he himself delights in the forms of vice, and others in a muse of another character.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet most persons say, that the excellence of music is to give pleasure to our souls.</div><div class="sentence"> But this is intolerable and blasphemous; there is, however, a much more plausible account of the delusion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The adaptation of art to the characters of men.</div><div class="sentence"> Choric movements are imitations of manners occurring in various actions, fortunes, dispositions,—each particular is imitated, and those to whom the words, or songs, or dances are suited, either by nature or habit or both, cannot help feeling pleasure in them and applauding them, and calling them beautiful.</div><div class="sentence"> But those whose natures, or ways, or habits are unsuited to them, cannot delight in them or applaud them, and they call them base.</div><div class="sentence"> There are others, again, whose natures are right and their habits wrong, or whose habits are right and their natures wrong, and they praise one thing, but are pleased at another.</div><div class="sentence"> For they say that all these imitations are pleasant, but not good.</div><div class="sentence"> And in the presence of those whom they think wise, they are ashamed of dancing and singing in the baser manner, or of deliberately lending any countenance to such proceedings; and yet, they have a secret pleasure in them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And is any harm done to the lover of vicious dances or songs, or any good done to the approver of the opposite sort of pleasure?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I think that there is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  'I think' is not the word, but I would say, rather, 'I am certain.'</div><div class="sentence"> For must they not have the same effect as when a man associates with bad characters, whom he likes and approves rather than dislikes, and only censures playfully because he has a suspicion of his own badness?</div><div class="sentence"> In that case, he who takes pleasure in them will surely become like those in whom he takes pleasure, even though he be ashamed to praise them.</div><div class="sentence"> And what greater good or evil can any destiny ever make us undergo?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I know of none.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then in a city which has good laws, or in future ages is to have them, bearing in mind the instruction and amusement which are given by music, can we suppose that the poets are to be allowed to teach in the dance anything which they themselves like, in the way of rhythm, or melody, or words, to the young children of any well-conditioned parents?</div><div class="sentence"> Is the poet to train his choruses as he pleases, without reference to virtue or vice?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">040</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That is surely quite unreasonable, and is not to be thought of.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And yet he may do this in almost any state with the exception of Egypt.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  And what are the laws about music and dancing in Egypt?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">046</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Your arguments seem to prove your point.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">047</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  May we not confidently say that the true use of music and of choral festivities is as follows:  We rejoice when we think that we prosper, and again we think that we prosper when we rejoice?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">049</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And when rejoicing in our good fortune, we are unable to be still?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">050</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Our young men break forth into dancing and singing, and we who are their elders deem that we are fulfilling our part in life when we look on at them.</div><div class="sentence"> Having lost our agility, we delight in their sports and merry-making, because we love to think of our former selves; and gladly institute contests for those who are able to awaken in us the memory of our youth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Is it altogether unmeaning to say, as the common people do about festivals, that he should be adjudged the wisest of men, and the winner of the palm, who gives us the greatest amount of pleasure and mirth?</div><div class="sentence"> For on such occasions, and when mirth is the order of the day, ought not he to be honoured most, and, as I was saying, bear the palm, who gives most mirth to the greatest number?</div><div class="sentence"> Now is this a true way of speaking or of acting?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Possibly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But, my dear friend, let us distinguish between different cases, and not be hasty in forming a judgment:  One way of considering the question will be to imagine a festival at which there are entertainments of all sorts, including gymnastic, musical, and equestrian contests:  the citizens are assembled; prizes are offered, and proclamation is made that any one who likes may enter the lists, and that he is to bear the palm who gives the most pleasure to the spectators—there is to be no regulation about the manner how; but he who is most successful in giving pleasure is to be crowned victor, and deemed to be the pleasantest of the candidates:  What is likely to be the result of such a proclamation?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  In what respect?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  There would be various exhibitions:  one man, like Homer, will exhibit a rhapsody, another a performance on the lute; one will have a tragedy, and another a comedy.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor would there be anything astonishing in some one imagining that he could gain the prize by exhibiting a puppet-show.</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose these competitors to meet, and not these only, but innumerable others as well—can you tell me who ought to be the victor?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I do not see how any one can answer you, or pretend to know, unless he has heard with his own ears the several competitors; the question is absurd.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, if neither of you can answer, shall I answer this question which you deem so absurd?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  If very small children are to determine the question, they will decide for the puppet show.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The older children will be advocates of comedy; educated women, and young men, and people in general, will favour tragedy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very likely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And I believe that we old men would have the greatest pleasure in hearing a rhapsodist recite well the Iliad and Odyssey, or one of the Hesiodic poems, and would award the victory to him.</div><div class="sentence"> But, who would really be the victor?—that is the question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly you and I will have to declare that those whom we old men adjudge victors ought to win; for our ways are far and away better than any which at present exist anywhere in the world.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Thus far I too should agree with the many, that the excellence of music is to be measured by pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> But the pleasure must not be that of chance persons; the fairest music is that which delights the best and best educated, and especially that which delights the one man who is pre-eminent in virtue and education.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore the judges must be men of character, for they will require both wisdom and courage; the true judge must not draw his inspiration from the theatre, nor ought he to be unnerved by the clamour of the many and his own incapacity; nor again, knowing the truth, ought he through cowardice and unmanliness carelessly to deliver a lying judgment, with the very same lips which have just appealed to the Gods before he judged.</div><div class="sentence"> He is sitting not as the disciple of the theatre, but, in his proper place, as their instructor, and he ought to be the enemy of all pandering to the pleasure of the spectators.</div><div class="sentence"> The ancient and common custom of Hellas, which still prevails in Italy and Sicily, did certainly leave the judgment to the body of spectators, who determined the victor by show of hands.</div><div class="sentence"> But this custom has been the destruction of the poets; for they are now in the habit of composing with a view to please the bad taste of their judges, and the result is that the spectators instruct themselves;—and also it has been the ruin of the theatre; they ought to be having characters put before them better than their own, and so receiving a higher pleasure, but now by their own act the opposite result follows.</div><div class="sentence"> What inference is to be drawn from all this?</div><div class="sentence"> Shall I tell you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The inference at which we arrive for the third or fourth time is, that education is the constraining and directing of youth towards that right reason, which the law affirms, and which the experience of the eldest and best has agreed to be truly right.</div><div class="sentence"> In order, then, that the soul of the child may not be habituated to feel joy and sorrow in a manner at variance with the law, and those who obey the law, but may rather follow the law and rejoice and sorrow at the same things as the aged—in order, I say, to produce this effect, chants appear to have been invented, which really enchant, and are designed to implant that harmony of which we speak.</div><div class="sentence"> And, because the mind of the child is incapable of enduring serious training, they are called plays and songs, and are performed in play; just as when men are sick and ailing in their bodies, their attendants give them wholesome diet in pleasant meats and drinks, but unwholesome diet in disagreeable things, in order that they may learn, as they ought, to like the one, and to dislike the other.</div><div class="sentence"> And similarly the true legislator will persuade, and, if he cannot persuade, will compel the poet to express, as he ought, by fair and noble words, in his rhythms, the figures, and in his melodies, the music of temperate and brave and in every way good men.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  But do you really imagine, Stranger, that this is the way in which poets generally compose in States at the present day?</div><div class="sentence"> As far as I can observe, except among us and among the Lacedaemonians, there are no regulations like those of which you speak; in other places novelties are always being introduced in dancing and in music, generally not under the authority of any law, but at the instigation of lawless pleasures; and these pleasures are so far from being the same, as you describe the Egyptian to be, or having the same principles, that they are never the same.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Most true, Cleinias; and I daresay that I may have expressed myself obscurely, and so led you to imagine that I was speaking of some really existing state of things, whereas I was only saying what regulations I would like to have about music; and hence there occurred a misapprehension on your part.</div><div class="sentence"> For when evils are far gone and irremediable, the task of censuring them is never pleasant, although at times necessary.</div><div class="sentence"> But as we do not really differ, will you let me ask you whether you consider such institutions to be more prevalent among the Cretans and Lacedaemonians than among the other Hellenes?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">074</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly they are.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And if they were extended to the other Hellenes, would it be an improvement on the present state of things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">076</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  A very great improvement, if the customs which prevail among them were such as prevail among us and the Lacedaemonians, and such as you were just now saying ought to prevail.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us see whether we understand one another: —Are not the principles of education and music which prevail among you as follows:  you compel your poets to say that the good man, if he be temperate and just, is fortunate and happy; and this whether he be great and strong or small and weak, and whether he be rich or poor; and, on the other hand, if he have a wealth passing that of Cinyras or Midas, and be unjust, he is wretched and lives in misery?</div><div class="sentence"> As the poet says, and with truth:  I sing not, I care not about him who accomplishes all noble things, not having justice; let him who 'draws near and stretches out his hand against his enemies be a just man.'</div><div class="sentence"> But if he be unjust, I would not have him 'look calmly upon bloody death,' nor 'surpass in swiftness the Thracian Boreas;' and let no other thing that is called good ever be his.</div><div class="sentence"> For the goods of which the many speak are not really good:  first in the catalogue is placed health, beauty next, wealth third; and then innumerable others, as for example to have a keen eye or a quick ear, and in general to have all the senses perfect; or, again, to be a tyrant and do as you like; and the final consummation of happiness is to have acquired all these things, and when you have acquired them to become at once immortal.</div><div class="sentence"> But you and I say, that while to the just and holy all these things are the best of possessions, to the unjust they are all, including even health, the greatest of evils.</div><div class="sentence"> For in truth, to have sight, and hearing, and the use of the senses, or to live at all without justice and virtue, even though a man be rich in all the so-called goods of fortune, is the greatest of evils, if life be immortal; but not so great, if the bad man lives only a very short time.</div><div class="sentence"> These are the truths which, if I am not mistaken, you will persuade or compel your poets to utter with suitable accompaniments of harmony and rhythm, and in these they must train up your youth.</div><div class="sentence"> Am I not right?</div><div class="sentence"> For I plainly declare that evils as they are termed are goods to the unjust, and only evils to the just, and that goods are truly good to the good, but evil to the evil.</div><div class="sentence"> Let me ask again, Are you and I agreed about this?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">078</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I think that we partly agree and partly do not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">079</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  When a man has health and wealth and a tyranny which lasts, and when he is pre-eminent in strength and courage, and has the gift of immortality, and none of the so-called evils which counter-balance these goods, but only the injustice and insolence of his own nature—of such an one you are, I suspect, unwilling to believe that he is miserable rather than happy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That is quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">081</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Once more:  Suppose that he be valiant and strong, and handsome and rich, and does throughout his whole life whatever he likes, still, if he be unrighteous and insolent, would not both of you agree that he will of necessity live basely?</div><div class="sentence"> You will surely grant so much?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">082</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">083</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And an evil life too?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">084</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I am not equally disposed to grant that.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">085</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Will he not live painfully and to his own disadvantage?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">086</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  How can I possibly say so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  How!</div><div class="sentence"> Then may Heaven make us to be of one mind, for now we are of two.</div><div class="sentence"> To me, dear Cleinias, the truth of what I am saying is as plain as the fact that Crete is an island.</div><div class="sentence"> And, if I were a lawgiver, I would try to make the poets and all the citizens speak in this strain, and I would inflict the heaviest penalties on any one in all the land who should dare to say that there are bad men who lead pleasant lives, or that the profitable and gainful is one thing, and the just another; and there are many other matters about which I should make my citizens speak in a manner different from the Cretans and Lacedaemonians of this age, and I may say, indeed, from the world in general.</div><div class="sentence"> For tell me, my good friends, by Zeus and Apollo tell me, if I were to ask these same Gods who were your legislators,—Is not the most just life also the pleasantest?</div><div class="sentence"> or are there two lives, one of which is the justest and the other the pleasantest?—and they were to reply that there are two; and thereupon I proceeded to ask, (that would be the right way of pursuing the enquiry), Which are the happier—those who lead the justest, or those who lead the pleasantest life?</div><div class="sentence"> and they replied, Those who lead the pleasantest—that would be a very strange answer, which I should not like to put into the mouth of the Gods.</div><div class="sentence"> The words will come with more propriety from the lips of fathers and legislators, and therefore I will repeat my former questions to one of them, and suppose him to say again that he who leads the pleasantest life is the happiest.</div><div class="sentence"> And to that I rejoin: —O my father, did you not wish me to live as happily as possible?</div><div class="sentence"> And yet you also never ceased telling me that I should live as justly as possible.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, here the giver of the rule, whether he be legislator or father, will be in a dilemma, and will in vain endeavour to be consistent with himself.</div><div class="sentence"> But if he were to declare that the justest life is also the happiest, every one hearing him would enquire, if I am not mistaken, what is that good and noble principle in life which the law approves, and which is superior to pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> For what good can the just man have which is separated from pleasure?</div><div class="sentence"> Shall we say that glory and fame, coming from Gods and men, though good and noble, are nevertheless unpleasant, and infamy pleasant?</div><div class="sentence"> Certainly not, sweet legislator.</div><div class="sentence"> Or shall we say that the not-doing of wrong and there being no wrong done is good and honourable, although there is no pleasure in it, and that the doing wrong is pleasant, but evil and base?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">088</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The view which identifies the pleasant and the pleasant and the just and the good and the noble has an excellent moral and religious tendency.</div><div class="sentence"> And the opposite view is most at variance with the designs of the legislator, and is, in his opinion, infamous; for no one, if he can help, will be persuaded to do that which gives him more pain than pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> But as distant prospects are apt to make us dizzy, especially in childhood, the legislator will try to purge away the darkness and exhibit the truth; he will persuade the citizens, in some way or other, by customs and praises and words, that just and unjust are shadows only, and that injustice, which seems opposed to justice, when contemplated by the unjust and evil man appears pleasant and the just most unpleasant; but that from the just man's point of view, the very opposite is the appearance of both of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And which may be supposed to be the truer judgment—that of the inferior or of the better soul?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Surely, that of the better soul.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">093</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then the unjust life must not only be more base and depraved, but also more unpleasant than the just and holy life?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That seems to be implied in the present argument.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And even supposing this were otherwise, and not as the argument has proven, still the lawgiver, who is worth anything, if he ever ventures to tell a lie to the young for their good, could not invent a more useful lie than this, or one which will have a better effect in making them do what is right, not on compulsion but voluntarily.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Truth, Stranger, is a noble thing and a lasting, but a thing of which men are hard to be persuaded.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And yet the story of the Sidonian Cadmus, which is so improbable, has been readily believed, and also innumerable other tales.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">098</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What is that story?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The story of armed men springing up after the sowing of teeth, which the legislator may take as a proof that he can persuade the minds of the young of anything; so that he has only to reflect and find out what belief will be of the greatest public advantage, and then use all his efforts to make the whole community utter one and the same word in their songs and tales and discourses all their life long.</div><div class="sentence"> But if you do not agree with me, there is no reason why you should not argue on the other side.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">100</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I do not see that any argument can fairly be raised by either of us against what you are now saying.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The next suggestion which I have to offer is, that all our three choruses shall sing to the young and tender souls of children, reciting in their strains all the noble thoughts of which we have already spoken, or are about to speak; and the sum of them shall be, that the life which is by the Gods deemed to be the happiest is also the best;—we shall affirm this to be a most certain truth; and the minds of our young disciples will be more likely to receive these words of ours than any others which we might address to them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I assent to what you say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">103</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  First will enter in their natural order the sacred choir composed of children, which is to sing lustily the heaven-taught lay to the whole city.</div><div class="sentence"> Next will follow the choir of young men under the age of thirty, who will call upon the God Paean to testify to the truth of their words, and will pray him to be gracious to the youth and to turn their hearts.</div><div class="sentence"> Thirdly, the choir of elder men, who are from thirty to sixty years of age, will also sing.</div><div class="sentence"> There remain those who are too old to sing, and they will tell stories, illustrating the same virtues, as with the voice of an oracle.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Who are those who compose the third choir, Stranger?</div><div class="sentence"> for I do not clearly understand what you mean to say about them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And yet almost all that I have been saying has been said with a view to them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Will you try to be a little plainer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I was speaking at the commencement of our discourse, as you will remember, of the fiery nature of young creatures:  I said that they were unable to keep quiet either in limb or voice, and that they called out and jumped about in a disorderly manner; and that no other animal attained to any perception of order, but man only.</div><div class="sentence"> Now the order of motion is called rhythm, and the order of the voice, in which high and low are duly mingled, is called harmony; and both together are termed choric song.</div><div class="sentence"> And I said that the Gods had pity on us, and gave us Apollo and the Muses to be our playfellows and leaders in the dance; and Dionysus, as I dare say that you will remember, was the third.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I quite remember.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">109</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Thus far I have spoken of the chorus of Apollo and the Muses, and I have still to speak of the remaining chorus, which is that of Dionysus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  How is that arranged?</div><div class="sentence"> There is something strange, at any rate on first hearing, in a Dionysiac chorus of old men, if you really mean that those who are above thirty, and may be fifty, or from fifty to sixty years of age, are to dance in his honour.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">111</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Very true; and therefore it must be shown that there is good reason for the proposal.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">115</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  That every man and boy, slave and free, both sexes, and the whole city, should never cease charming themselves with the strains of which we have spoken; and that there should be every sort of change and variation of them in order to take away the effect of sameness, so that the singers may always receive pleasure from their hymns, and may never weary of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">116</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Every one will agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">117</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Where, then, will that best part of our city which, by reason of age and intelligence, has the greatest influence, sing these fairest of strains, which are to do so much good?</div><div class="sentence"> Shall we be so foolish as to let them off who would give us the most beautiful and also the most useful of songs?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">118</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  But, says the argument, we cannot let them off.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">121</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  When a man is advancing in years, he is afraid and reluctant to sing;—he has no pleasure in his own performances; and if compulsion is used, he will be more and more ashamed, the older and more discreet he grows;—is not this true?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">122</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">123</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Well, and will he not be yet more ashamed if he has to stand up and sing in the theatre to a mixed audience?—and if moreover when he is required to do so, like the other choirs who contend for prizes, and have been trained under a singing master, he is pinched and hungry, he will certainly have a feeling of shame and discomfort which will make him very unwilling to exhibit.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">124</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  No doubt.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">125</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  How, then, shall we reassure him, and get him to sing?</div><div class="sentence"> Shall we begin by enacting that boys shall not taste wine at all until they are eighteen years of age; we will tell them that fire must not be poured upon fire, whether in the body or in the soul, until they begin to go to work—this is a precaution which has to be taken against the excitableness of youth;—afterwards they may taste wine in moderation up to the age of thirty, but while a man is young he should abstain altogether from intoxication and from excess of wine; when, at length, he has reached forty years, after dinner at a public mess, he may invite not only the other Gods, but Dionysus above all, to the mystery and festivity of the elder men, making use of the wine which he has given men to lighten the sourness of old age; that in age we may renew our youth, and forget our sorrows; and also in order that the nature of the soul, like iron melted in the fire, may become softer and so more impressible.</div><div class="sentence"> In the first place, will not any one who is thus mellowed be more ready and less ashamed to sing—I do not say before a large audience, but before a moderate company; nor yet among strangers, but among his familiars, and, as we have often said, to chant, and to enchant?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">126</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  He will be far more ready.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">127</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  There will be no impropriety in our using such a method of persuading them to join with us in song.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">128</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  None at all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">129</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And what strain will they sing, and what muse will they hymn?</div><div class="sentence"> The strain should clearly be one suitable to them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">130</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">131</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And what strain is suitable for heroes?</div><div class="sentence"> Shall they sing a choric strain?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">132</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Truly, Stranger, we of Crete and Lacedaemon know no strain other than that which we have learnt and been accustomed to sing in our chorus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">133</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I dare say; for you have never acquired the knowledge of the most beautiful kind of song, in your military way of life, which is modelled after the camp, and is not like that of dwellers in cities; and you have your young men herding and feeding together like young colts.</div><div class="sentence"> No one takes his own individual colt and drags him away from his fellows against his will, raging and foaming, and gives him a groom to attend to him alone, and trains and rubs him down privately, and gives him the qualities in education which will make him not only a good soldier, but also a governor of a state and of cities.</div><div class="sentence"> Such an one, as we said at first, would be a greater warrior than he of whom Tyrtaeus sings; and he would honour courage everywhere, but always as the fourth, and not as the first part of virtue, either in individuals or states.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">134</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Once more, Stranger, I must complain that you depreciate our lawgivers.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">135</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Not intentionally, if at all, my good friend; but whither the argument leads, thither let us follow; for if there be indeed some strain of song more beautiful than that of the choruses or the public theatres, I should like to impart it to those who, as we say, are ashamed of these, and want to have the best.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">136</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">137</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  When things have an accompanying charm, either the best thing in them is this very charm, or there is some rightness or utility possessed by them;—for example, I should say that eating and drinking, and the use of food in general, have an accompanying charm which we call pleasure; but that this rightness and utility is just the healthfulness of the things served up to us, which is their true rightness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">138</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Just so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">139</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Thus, too, I should say that learning has a certain accompanying charm which is the pleasure; but that the right and the profitable, the good and the noble, are qualities which the truth gives to it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">140</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">141</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And so in the imitative arts—if they succeed in making likenesses, and are accompanied by pleasure, may not their works be said to have a charm?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">142</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">143</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But equal proportions, whether of quality or quantity, and not pleasure, speaking generally, would give them truth or rightness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">144</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">145</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then that only can be rightly judged by the standard of pleasure, which makes or furnishes no utility or truth or likeness, nor on the other hand is productive of any hurtful quality, but exists solely for the sake of the accompanying charm; and the term 'pleasure' is most appropriately applied to it when these other qualities are absent.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">146</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  You are speaking of harmless pleasure, are you not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">147</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; and this I term amusement, when doing neither harm nor good in any degree worth speaking of.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">148</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">149</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then, if such be our principles, we must assert that imitation is not to be judged of by pleasure and false opinion; and this is true of all equality, for the equal is not equal or the symmetrical symmetrical, because somebody thinks or likes something, but they are to be judged of by the standard of truth, and by no other whatever.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">150</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">151</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Do we not regard all music as representative and imitative?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">152</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">153</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then, when any one says that music is to be judged of by pleasure, his doctrine cannot be admitted; and if there be any music of which pleasure is the criterion, such music is not to be sought out or deemed to have any real excellence, but only that other kind of music which is an imitation of the good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">154</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">155</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And those who seek for the best kind of song and music ought not to seek for that which is pleasant, but for that which is true; and the truth of imitation consists, as we were saying, in rendering the thing imitated according to quantity and quality.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">156</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">157</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And every one will admit that musical compositions are all imitative and representative.</div><div class="sentence"> Will not poets and spectators and actors all agree in this?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">158</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  They will.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">159</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Surely then he who would judge correctly must know what each composition is; for if he does not know what is the character and meaning of the piece, and what it represents, he will never discern whether the intention is true or false.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">160</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">161</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And will he who does not know what is true be able to distinguish what is good and bad?</div><div class="sentence"> My statement is not very clear; but perhaps you will understand me better if I put the matter in another way.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">162</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  How?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">163</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  There are ten thousand likenesses of objects of sight?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">164</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">165</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And can he who does not know what the exact object is which is imitated, ever know whether the resemblance is truthfully executed?</div><div class="sentence"> I mean, for example, whether a statue has the proportions of a body, and the true situation of the parts; what those proportions are, and how the parts fit into one another in due order; also their colours and conformations, or whether this is all confused in the execution:  do you think that any one can know about this, who does not know what the animal is which has been imitated?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">166</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">167</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But even if we know that the thing pictured or sculptured is a man, who has received at the hand of the artist all his proper parts and colours and shapes, must we not also know whether the work is beautiful or in any respect deficient in beauty?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">168</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  If this were not required, Stranger, we should all of us be judges of beauty.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">169</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Very true; and may we not say that in everything imitated, whether in drawing, music, or any other art, he who is to be a competent judge must possess three things;—he must know, in the first place, of what the imitation is; secondly, he must know that it is true; and thirdly, that it has been well executed in words and melodies and rhythms?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">170</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">171</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then let us not faint in discussing the peculiar difficulty of music.</div><div class="sentence"> Music is more celebrated than any other kind of imitation, and therefore requires the greatest care of them all.</div><div class="sentence"> For if a man makes a mistake here, he may do himself the greatest injury by welcoming evil dispositions, and the mistake may be very difficult to discern, because the poets are artists very inferior in character to the Muses themselves, who would never fall into the monstrous error of assigning to the words of men the gestures and songs of women; nor after combining the melodies with the gestures of freemen would they add on the rhythms of slaves and men of the baser sort; nor, beginning with the rhythms and gestures of freemen, would they assign to them a melody or words which are of an opposite character; nor would they mix up the voices and sounds of animals and of men and instruments, and every other sort of noise, as if they were all one.</div><div class="sentence"> But human poets are fond of introducing this sort of inconsistent mixture, and so make themselves ridiculous in the eyes of those who, as Orpheus says, 'are ripe for true pleasure.'</div><div class="sentence"> The experienced see all this confusion, and yet the poets go on and make still further havoc by separating the rhythm and the figure of the dance from the melody, setting bare words to metre, and also separating the melody and the rhythm from the words, using the lyre or the flute alone.</div><div class="sentence"> For when there are no words, it is very difficult to recognize the meaning of the harmony and rhythm, or to see that any worthy object is imitated by them.</div><div class="sentence"> And we must acknowledge that all this sort of thing, which aims only at swiftness and smoothness and a brutish noise, and uses the flute and the lyre not as the mere accompaniments of the dance and song, is exceedingly coarse and tasteless.</div><div class="sentence"> The use of either instrument, when unaccompanied, leads to every sort of irregularity and trickery.</div><div class="sentence"> This is all rational enough.</div><div class="sentence"> But we are considering not how our choristers, who are from thirty to fifty years of age, and may be over fifty, are not to use the Muses, but how they are to use them.</div><div class="sentence"> And the considerations which we have urged seem to show in what way these fifty years' old choristers who are to sing, may be expected to be better trained.</div><div class="sentence"> For they need to have a quick perception and knowledge of harmonies and rhythms; otherwise, how can they ever know whether a melody would be rightly sung to the Dorian mode, or to the rhythm which the poet has assigned to it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">172</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly they cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">173</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The many are ridiculous in imagining that they know what is in proper harmony and rhythm, and what is not, when they can only be made to sing and step in rhythm by force; it never occurs to them that they are ignorant of what they are doing.</div><div class="sentence"> Now every melody is right when it has suitable harmony and rhythm, and wrong when unsuitable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">174</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That is most certain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">175</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But can a man who does not know a thing, as we were saying, know that the thing is right?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">176</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">177</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then now, as would appear, we are making the discovery that our newly-appointed choristers, whom we hereby invite and, although they are their own masters, compel to sing, must be educated to such an extent as to be able to follow the steps of the rhythm and the notes of the song, that they may know the harmonies and rhythms, and be able to select what are suitable for men of their age and character to sing; and may sing them, and have innocent pleasure from their own performance, and also lead younger men to welcome with dutiful delight good dispositions.</div><div class="sentence"> Having such training, they will attain a more accurate knowledge than falls to the lot of the common people, or even of the poets themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> For the poet need not know the third point, viz., whether the imitation is good or not, though he can hardly help knowing the laws of melody and rhythm.</div><div class="sentence"> But the aged chorus must know all the three, that they may choose the best, and that which is nearest to the best; for otherwise they will never be able to charm the souls of young men in the way of virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> And now the original design of the argument which was intended to bring eloquent aid to the Chorus of Dionysus, has been accomplished to the best of our ability, and let us see whether we were right: —I should imagine that a drinking assembly is likely to become more and more tumultuous as the drinking goes on:  this, as we were saying at first, will certainly be the case.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">178</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">179</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Every man has a more than natural elevation; his heart is glad within him, and he will say anything and will be restrained by nobody at such a time; he fancies that he is able to rule over himself and all mankind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">180</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">181</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Were we not saying that on such occasions the souls of the drinkers become like iron heated in the fire, and grow softer and younger, and are easily moulded by him who knows how to educate and fashion them, just as when they were young, and that this fashioner of them is the same who prescribed for them in the days of their youth, viz., the good legislator; and that he ought to enact laws of the banquet, which, when a man is confident, bold, and impudent, and unwilling to wait his turn and have his share of silence and speech, and drinking and music, will change his character into the opposite—such laws as will infuse into him a just and noble fear, which will take up arms at the approach of insolence, being that divine fear which we have called reverence and shame?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">182</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">183</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And the guardians of these laws and fellow-workers with them are the calm and sober generals of the drinkers; and without their help there is greater difficulty in fighting against drink than in fighting against enemies when the commander of an army is not himself calm; and he who is unwilling to obey them and the commanders of Dionysiac feasts who are more than sixty years of age, shall suffer a disgrace as great as he who disobeys military leaders, or even greater.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">184</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">185</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  If, then, drinking and amusement were regulated in this way, would not the companions of our revels be improved?</div><div class="sentence"> they would part better friends than they were, and not, as now, enemies.</div><div class="sentence"> Their whole intercourse would be regulated by law and observant of it, and the sober would be the leaders of the drunken.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">186</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I think so too, if drinking were regulated as you propose.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">187</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us not then simply censure the gift of Dionysus as bad and unfit to be received into the State.</div><div class="sentence"> For wine has many excellences, and one pre-eminent one, about which there is a difficulty in speaking to the many, from a fear of their misconceiving and misunderstanding what is said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">188</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  To what do you refer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">189</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  There is a tradition or story, which has somehow crept about the world, that Dionysus was robbed of his wits by his stepmother Here, and that out of revenge he inspires Bacchic furies and dancing madnesses in others; for which reason he gave men wine.</div><div class="sentence"> Such traditions concerning the Gods I leave to those who think that they may be safely uttered (compare Euthyph.</div><div class="sentence"> ; Republic); I only know that no animal at birth is mature or perfect in intelligence; and in the intermediate period, in which he has not yet acquired his own proper sense, he rages and roars without rhyme or reason; and when he has once got on his legs he jumps about without rhyme or reason; and this, as you will remember, has been already said by us to be the origin of music and gymnastic.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">190</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure, I remember.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">191</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And did we not say that the sense of harmony and rhythm sprang from this beginning among men, and that Apollo and the Muses and Dionysus were the Gods whom we had to thank for them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">192</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">193</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The other story implied that wine was given man out of revenge, and in order to make him mad; but our present doctrine, on the contrary, is, that wine was given him as a balm, and in order to implant modesty in the soul, and health and strength in the body.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">194</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That, Stranger, is precisely what was said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">195</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then half the subject may now be considered to have been discussed; shall we proceed to the consideration of the other half?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">196</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What is the other half, and how do you divide the subject?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">197</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The whole choral art is also in our view the whole of education; and of this art, rhythms and harmonies form the part which has to do with the voice.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">198</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">199</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The movement of the body has rhythm in common with the movement of the voice, but gesture is peculiar to it, whereas song is simply the movement of the voice.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">200</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">201</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And the sound of the voice which reaches and educates the soul, we have ventured to term music.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">202</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  We were right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">203</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And the movement of the body, when regarded as an amusement, we termed dancing; but when extended and pursued with a view to the excellence of the body, this scientific training may be called gymnastic.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">204</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">205</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Music, which was one half of the choral art, may be said to have been completely discussed.</div><div class="sentence"> Shall we proceed to the other half or not?</div><div class="sentence"> What would you like?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">206</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  My good friend, when you are talking with a Cretan and Lacedaemonian, and we have discussed music and not gymnastic, what answer are either of us likely to make to such an enquiry?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">207</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  An answer is contained in your question; and I understand and accept what you say not only as an answer, but also as a command to proceed with gymnastic.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">208</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  You quite understand me; do as you say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">209</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I will; and there will not be any difficulty in speaking intelligibly to you about a subject with which both of you are far more familiar than with music.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">210</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  There will not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">211</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Is not the origin of gymnastics, too, to be sought in the tendency to rapid motion which exists in all animals; man, as we were saying, having attained the sense of rhythm, created and invented dancing; and melody arousing and awakening rhythm, both united formed the choral art?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">212</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">213</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And one part of this subject has been already discussed by us, and there still remains another to be discussed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">214</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">215</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I have first a final word to add to my discourse about drink, if you will allow me to do so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">216</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What more have you to say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">217</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I should say that if a city seriously means to adopt the practice of drinking under due regulation and with a view to the enforcement of temperance, and in like manner, and on the same principle, will allow of other pleasures, designing to gain the victory over them—in this way all of them may be used.</div><div class="sentence"> But if the State makes drinking an amusement only, and whoever likes may drink whenever he likes, and with whom he likes, and add to this any other indulgences, I shall never agree or allow that this city or this man should practise drinking.</div><div class="sentence"> I would go further than the Cretans and Lacedaemonians, and am disposed rather to the law of the Carthaginians, that no one while he is on a campaign should be allowed to taste wine at all, but that he should drink water during all that time, and that in the city no slave, male or female, should ever drink wine; and that no magistrates should drink during their year of office, nor should pilots of vessels or judges while on duty taste wine at all, nor any one who is going to hold a consultation about any matter of importance; nor in the day-time at all, unless in consequence of exercise or as medicine; nor again at night, when any one, either man or woman, is minded to get children.</div><div class="sentence"> There are numberless other cases also in which those who have good sense and good laws ought not to drink wine, so that if what I say is true, no city will need many vineyards.</div><div class="sentence"> Their husbandry and their way of life in general will follow an appointed order, and their cultivation of the vine will be the most limited and the least common of their employments.</div><div class="sentence"> And this, Stranger, shall be the crown of my discourse about wine, if you agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">218</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Excellent:  we agree.</div></div>

<h2>BOOK III.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Enough of this.</div><div class="sentence"> And what, then, is to be regarded as the origin of government?</div><div class="sentence"> Will not a man be able to judge of it best from a point of view in which he may behold the progress of states and their transitions to good or evil?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I mean that he might watch them from the point of view of time, and observe the changes which take place in them during infinite ages.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Why, do you think that you can reckon the time which has elapsed since cities first existed and men were citizens of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Hardly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But are sure that it must be vast and incalculable?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And have not thousands and thousands of cities come into being during this period and as many perished?</div><div class="sentence"> And has not each of them had every form of government many times over, now growing larger, now smaller, and again improving or declining?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us endeavour to ascertain the cause of these changes; for that will probably explain the first origin and development of forms of government.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div><div class="sentence"> You shall endeavour to impart your thoughts to us, and we will make an effort to understand you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Do you believe that there is any truth in ancient traditions?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What traditions?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The traditions about the many destructions of mankind which have been occasioned by deluges and pestilences, and in many other ways, and of the survival of a remnant?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Every one is disposed to believe them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us consider one of them, that which was caused by the famous deluge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What are we to observe about it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I mean to say that those who then escaped would only be hill shepherds,—small sparks of the human race preserved on the tops of mountains.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Such survivors would necessarily be unacquainted with the arts and the various devices which are suggested to the dwellers in cities by interest or ambition, and with all the wrongs which they contrive against one another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us suppose, then, that the cities in the plain and on the sea-coast were utterly destroyed at that time.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Would not all implements have then perished and every other excellent invention of political or any other sort of wisdom have utterly disappeared?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Why, yes, my friend; and if things had always continued as they are at present ordered, how could any discovery have ever been made even in the least particular?</div><div class="sentence"> For it is evident that the arts were unknown during ten thousand times ten thousand years.</div><div class="sentence"> And no more than a thousand or two thousand years have elapsed since the discoveries of Daedalus, Orpheus and Palamedes,—since Marsyas and Olympus invented music, and Amphion the lyre—not to speak of numberless other inventions which are but of yesterday.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Have you forgotten, Cleinias, the name of a friend who is really of yesterday?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose that you mean Epimenides.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The same, my friend; he does indeed far overleap the heads of all mankind by his invention; for he carried out in practice, as you declare, what of old Hesiod (Works and Days) only preached.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, according to our tradition.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  After the great destruction, may we not suppose that the state of man was something of this sort: —In the beginning of things there was a fearful illimitable desert and a vast expanse of land; a herd or two of oxen would be the only survivors of the animal world; and there might be a few goats, these too hardly enough to maintain the shepherds who tended them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And of cities or governments or legislation, about which we are now talking, do you suppose that they could have any recollection at all?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  None whatever.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And out of this state of things has there not sprung all that we now are and have:  cities and governments, and arts and laws, and a great deal of vice and a great deal of virtue?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Why, my good friend, how can we possibly suppose that those who knew nothing of all the good and evil of cities could have attained their full development, whether of virtue or of vice?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I understand your meaning, and you are quite right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But, as time advanced and the race multiplied, the world came to be what the world is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">040</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Doubtless the change was not made all in a moment, but little by little, during a very long period of time.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  A highly probable supposition.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">043</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  At first, they would have a natural fear ringing in their ears which would prevent their descending from the heights into the plain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">044</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The fewness of the survivors at that time would have made them all the more desirous of seeing one another; but then the means of travelling either by land or sea had been almost entirely lost, as I may say, with the loss of the arts, and there was great difficulty in getting at one another; for iron and brass and all metals were jumbled together and had disappeared in the chaos; nor was there any possibility of extracting ore from them; and they had scarcely any means of felling timber.</div><div class="sentence"> Even if you suppose that some implements might have been preserved in the mountains, they must quickly have worn out and vanished, and there would be no more of them until the art of metallurgy had again revived.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">046</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  There could not have been.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">047</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  In how many generations would this be attained?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">048</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly, not for many generations.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">049</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  During this period, and for some time afterwards, all the arts which require iron and brass and the like would disappear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">050</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Faction and war would also have died out in those days, and for many reasons.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  How would that be?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  In the first place, the desolation of these primitive men would create in them a feeling of affection and goodwill towards one another; and, secondly, they would have no occasion to quarrel about their subsistence, for they would have pasture in abundance, except just at first, and in some particular cases; and from their pasture-land they would obtain the greater part of their food in a primitive age, having plenty of milk and flesh; moreover they would procure other food by the chase, not to be despised either in quantity or quality.</div><div class="sentence"> They would also have abundance of clothing, and bedding, and dwellings, and utensils either capable of standing on the fire or not; for the plastic and weaving arts do not require any use of iron:  and God has given these two arts to man in order to provide him with all such things, that, when reduced to the last extremity, the human race may still grow and increase.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence in those days mankind were not very poor; nor was poverty a cause of difference among them; and rich they could not have been, having neither gold nor silver: —such at that time was their condition.</div><div class="sentence"> And the community which has neither poverty nor riches will always have the noblest principles; in it there is no insolence or injustice, nor, again, are there any contentions or envyings.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore they were good, and also because they were what is called simple-minded; and when they were told about good and evil, they in their simplicity believed what they heard to be very truth and practised it.</div><div class="sentence"> No one had the wit to suspect another of a falsehood, as men do now; but what they heard about Gods and men they believed to be true, and lived accordingly; and therefore they were in all respects such as we have described them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That quite accords with my views, and with those of my friend here.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Would not many generations living on in a simple manner, although ruder, perhaps, and more ignorant of the arts generally, and in particular of those of land or naval warfare, and likewise of other arts, termed in cities legal practices and party conflicts, and including all conceivable ways of hurting one another in word and deed;—although inferior to those who lived before the deluge, or to the men of our day in these respects, would they not, I say, be simpler and more manly, and also more temperate and altogether more just?</div><div class="sentence"> The reason has been already explained.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I should wish you to understand that what has preceded and what is about to follow, has been, and will be said, with the intention of explaining what need the men of that time had of laws, and who was their lawgiver.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  And thus far what you have said has been very well said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  They could hardly have wanted lawgivers as yet; nothing of that sort was likely to have existed in their days, for they had no letters at this early period; they lived by habit and the customs of their ancestors, as they are called.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Probably.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But there was already existing a form of government which, if I am not mistaken, is generally termed a lordship, and this still remains in many places, both among Hellenes and barbarians (compare Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Pol.</div><div class="sentence"> ), and is the government which is declared by Homer to have prevailed among the Cyclopes: —</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span> <div class="sentence">  'They have neither councils nor judgments, but they dwell in hollow caves on the tops of high mountains, and every one gives law to his wife and children, and they do not busy themselves about one another.'</div><div class="sentence"> (Odyss.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That seems to be a charming poet of yours; I have read some other verses of his, which are very clever; but I do not know much of him, for foreign poets are very little read among the Cretans.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  But they are in Lacedaemon, and he appears to be the prince of them all; the manner of life, however, which he describes is not Spartan, but rather Ionian, and he seems quite to confirm what you are saying, when he traces up the ancient state of mankind by the help of tradition to barbarism.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, he does confirm it; and we may accept his witness to the fact that such forms of government sometimes arise.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  We may.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And were not such states composed of men who had been dispersed in single habitations and families by the poverty which attended the devastations; and did not the eldest then rule among them, because with them government originated in the authority of a father and a mother, whom, like a flock of birds, they followed, forming one troop under the patriarchal rule and sovereignty of their parents, which of all sovereignties is the most just?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  After this they came together in greater numbers, and increased the size of their cities, and betook themselves to husbandry, first of all at the foot of the mountains, and made enclosures of loose walls and works of defence, in order to keep off wild beasts; thus creating a single large and common habitation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; at least we may suppose so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  There is another thing which would probably happen.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  When these larger habitations grew up out of the lesser original ones, each of the lesser ones would survive in the larger; every family would be under the rule of the eldest, and, owing to their separation from one another, would have peculiar customs in things divine and human, which they would have received from their several parents who had educated them; and these customs would incline them to order, when the parents had the element of order in their nature, and to courage, when they had the element of courage.</div><div class="sentence"> And they would naturally stamp upon their children, and upon their children's children, their own likings; and, as we are saying, they would find their way into the larger society, having already their own peculiar laws.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">074</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And every man surely likes his own laws best, and the laws of others not so well.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">076</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then now we seem to have stumbled upon the beginnings of legislation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">078</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">079</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The next step will be that these persons who have met together, will select some arbiters, who will review the laws of all of them, and will publicly present such as they approve to the chiefs who lead the tribes, and who are in a manner their kings, allowing them to choose those which they think best.</div><div class="sentence"> These persons will themselves be called legislators, and will appoint the magistrates, framing some sort of aristocracy, or perhaps monarchy, out of the dynasties or lordships, and in this altered state of the government they will live.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, that would be the natural order of things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">081</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then, now let us speak of a third form of government, in which all other forms and conditions of polities and cities concur.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">082</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">083</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The form which in fact Homer indicates as following the second.</div><div class="sentence"> This third form arose when, as he says, Dardanus founded Dardania: —</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">084</span> <div class="sentence">  'For not as yet had the holy Ilium been built on the plain to be a city of speaking men; but they were still dwelling at the foot of many-fountained Ida.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">085</span> <div class="sentence">  For indeed, in these verses, and in what he said of the Cyclopes, he speaks the words of God and nature; for poets are a divine race, and often in their strains, by the aid of the Muses and the Graces, they attain truth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">086</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then now let us proceed with the rest of our tale, which will probably be found to illustrate in some degree our proposed design: —Shall we do so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">088</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Ilium was built, when they descended from the mountain, in a large and fair plain, on a sort of low hill, watered by many rivers descending from Ida.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Such is the tradition.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And we must suppose this event to have taken place many ages after the deluge?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  A marvellous forgetfulness of the former destruction would appear to have come over them, when they placed their town right under numerous streams flowing from the heights, trusting for their security to not very high hills, either.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">093</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  There must have been a long interval, clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And, as population increased, many other cities would begin to be inhabited.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Doubtless.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Those cities made war against Troy—by sea as well as land—for at that time men were ceasing to be afraid of the sea.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">098</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The Achaeans remained ten years, and overthrew Troy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">100</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And during the ten years in which the Achaeans were besieging Ilium, the homes of the besiegers were falling into an evil plight.</div><div class="sentence"> Their youth revolted; and when the soldiers returned to their own cities and families, they did not receive them properly, and as they ought to have done, and numerous deaths, murders, exiles, were the consequence.</div><div class="sentence"> The exiles came again, under a new name, no longer Achaeans, but Dorians,—a name which they derived from Dorieus; for it was he who gathered them together.</div><div class="sentence"> The rest of the story is told by you Lacedaemonians as part of the history of Sparta.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Thus, after digressing from the original subject of laws into music and drinking-bouts, the argument has, providentially, come back to the same point, and presents to us another handle.</div><div class="sentence"> For we have reached the settlement of Lacedaemon; which, as you truly say, is in laws and in institutions the sister of Crete.</div><div class="sentence"> And we are all the better for the digression, because we have gone through various governments and settlements, and have been present at the foundation of a first, second, and third state, succeeding one another in infinite time.</div><div class="sentence"> And now there appears on the horizon a fourth state or nation which was once in process of settlement and has continued settled to this day.</div><div class="sentence"> If, out of all this, we are able to discern what is well or ill settled, and what laws are the salvation and what are the destruction of cities, and what changes would make a state happy, O Megillus and Cleinias, we may now begin again, unless we have some fault to find with the previous discussion.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then I suppose that we must consider this subject?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us place ourselves in thought at the moment when Lacedaemon and Argos and Messene and the rest of the Peloponnesus were all in complete subjection, Megillus, to your ancestors; for afterwards, as the legend informs us, they divided their army into three portions, and settled three cities, Argos, Messene, Lacedaemon.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Temenus was the king of Argos, Cresphontes of Messene, Procles and Eurysthenes of Lacedaemon.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">109</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  To these kings all the men of that day made oath that they would assist them, if any one subverted their kingdom.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">111</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">112</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But can a kingship be destroyed, or was any other form of government ever destroyed, by any but the rulers themselves?</div><div class="sentence"> No indeed, by Zeus.</div><div class="sentence"> Have we already forgotten what was said a little while ago?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">113</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">114</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And may we not now further confirm what was then mentioned?</div><div class="sentence"> For we have come upon facts which have brought us back again to the same principle; so that, in resuming the discussion, we shall not be enquiring about an empty theory, but about events which actually happened.</div><div class="sentence"> The case was as follows: —Three royal heroes made oath to three cities which were under a kingly government, and the cities to the kings, that both rulers and subjects should govern and be governed according to the laws which were common to all of them:  the rulers promised that as time and the race went forward they would not make their rule more arbitrary; and the subjects said that, if the rulers observed these conditions, they would never subvert or permit others to subvert those kingdoms; the kings were to assist kings and peoples when injured, and the peoples were to assist peoples and kings in like manner.</div><div class="sentence"> Is not this the fact?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">115</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">116</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And the three states to whom these laws were given, whether their kings or any others were the authors of them, had therefore the greatest security for the maintenance of their constitutions?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">117</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  What security?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">118</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  That the other two states were always to come to the rescue against a rebellious third.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">119</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">120</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Many persons say that legislators ought to impose such laws as the mass of the people will be ready to receive; but this is just as if one were to command gymnastic masters or physicians to treat or cure their pupils or patients in an agreeable manner.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">121</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">122</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Whereas the physician may often be too happy if he can restore health, and make the body whole, without any very great infliction of pain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">123</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">124</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  There was also another advantage possessed by the men of that day, which greatly lightened the task of passing laws.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">125</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  What advantage?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">126</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The legislators of that day, when they equalized property, escaped the great accusation which generally arises in legislation, if a person attempts to disturb the possession of land, or to abolish debts, because he sees that without this reform there can never be any real equality.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, in general, when the legislator attempts to make a new settlement of such matters, every one meets him with the cry, that 'he is not to disturb vested interests,'—declaring with imprecations that he is introducing agrarian laws and cancelling of debts, until a man is at his wits' end; whereas no one could quarrel with the Dorians for distributing the land,—there was nothing to hinder them; and as for debts, they had none which were considerable or of old standing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">127</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">128</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But then, my good friends, why did the settlement and legislation of their country turn out so badly?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">129</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  How do you mean; and why do you blame them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">130</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  There were three kingdoms, and of these, two quickly corrupted their original constitution and laws, and the only one which remained was the Spartan.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">131</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  The question which you ask is not easily answered.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">132</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And yet must be answered when we are enquiring about laws, this being our old man's sober game of play, whereby we beguile the way, as I was saying when we first set out on our journey.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">133</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly; and we must find out why this was.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">134</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  What laws are more worthy of our attention than those which have regulated such cities?</div><div class="sentence"> or what settlements of states are greater or more famous?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">135</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I know of none.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">136</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Can we doubt that your ancestors intended these institutions not only for the protection of Peloponnesus, but of all the Hellenes, in case they were attacked by the barbarian?</div><div class="sentence"> For the inhabitants of the region about Ilium, when they provoked by their insolence the Trojan war, relied upon the power of the Assyrians and the Empire of Ninus, which still existed and had a great prestige; the people of those days fearing the united Assyrian Empire just as we now fear the Great King.</div><div class="sentence"> And the second capture of Troy was a serious offence against them, because Troy was a portion of the Assyrian Empire.</div><div class="sentence"> To meet the danger the single army was distributed between three cities by the royal brothers, sons of Heracles,—a fair device, as it seemed, and a far better arrangement than the expedition against Troy.</div><div class="sentence"> For, firstly, the people of that day had, as they thought, in the Heraclidae better leaders than the Pelopidae; in the next place, they considered that their army was superior in valour to that which went against Troy; for, although the latter conquered the Trojans, they were themselves conquered by the Heraclidae—Achaeans by Dorians.</div><div class="sentence"> May we not suppose that this was the intention with which the men of those days framed the constitutions of their states?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">137</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">138</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And would not men who had shared with one another many dangers, and were governed by a single race of royal brothers, and had taken the advice of oracles, and in particular of the Delphian Apollo, be likely to think that such states would be firmly and lastingly established?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">139</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course they would.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">140</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yet these institutions, of which such great expectations were entertained, seem to have all rapidly vanished away; with the exception, as I was saying, of that small part of them which existed in your land.</div><div class="sentence"> And this third part has never to this day ceased warring against the two others; whereas, if the original idea had been carried out, and they had agreed to be one, their power would have been invincible in war.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">141</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  No doubt.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">142</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But what was the ruin of this glorious confederacy?</div><div class="sentence"> Here is a subject well worthy of consideration.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">143</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly, no one will ever find more striking instances of laws or governments being the salvation or destruction of great and noble interests, than are here presented to his view.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">144</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then now we seem to have happily arrived at a real and important question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">145</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">146</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Did you never remark, sage friend, that all men, and we ourselves at this moment, often fancy that they see some beautiful thing which might have effected wonders if any one had only known how to make a right use of it in some way; and yet this mode of looking at things may turn out after all to be a mistake, and not according to nature, either in our own case or in any other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">147</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  To what are you referring, and what do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">148</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I was thinking of my own admiration of the aforesaid Heracleid expedition, which was so noble, and might have had such wonderful results for the Hellenes, if only rightly used; and I was just laughing at myself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">149</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  But were you not right and wise in speaking as you did, and we in assenting to you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">150</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Perhaps; and yet I cannot help observing that any one who sees anything great or powerful, immediately has the feeling that—'If the owner only knew how to use his great and noble possession, how happy would he be, and what great results would he achieve!'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">151</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  And would he not be justified?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">152</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Reflect; in what point of view does this sort of praise appear just:  First, in reference to the question in hand: —If the then commanders had known how to arrange their army properly, how would they have attained success?</div><div class="sentence"> Would not this have been the way?</div><div class="sentence"> They would have bound them all firmly together and preserved them for ever, giving them freedom and dominion at pleasure, combined with the power of doing in the whole world, Hellenic and barbarian, whatever they and their descendants desired.</div><div class="sentence"> What other aim would they have had?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">153</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">154</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Suppose any one were in the same way to express his admiration at the sight of great wealth or family honour, or the like, he would praise them under the idea that through them he would attain either all or the greater and chief part of what he desires.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">155</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  He would.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">156</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Well, now, and does not the argument show that there is one common desire of all mankind?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">157</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">158</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The desire which a man has, that all things, if possible,—at any rate, things human,—may come to pass in accordance with his soul's desire.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">159</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">160</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And having this desire always, and at every time of life, in youth, in manhood, in age, he cannot help always praying for the fulfilment of it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">161</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  No doubt.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">162</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And we join in the prayers of our friends, and ask for them what they ask for themselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">163</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  We do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">164</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Dear is the son to the father—the younger to the elder.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">165</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">166</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And yet the son often prays to obtain things which the father prays that he may not obtain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">167</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  When the son is young and foolish, you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">168</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; or when the father, in the dotage of age or the heat of youth, having no sense of right and justice, prays with fervour, under the influence of feelings akin to those of Theseus when he cursed the unfortunate Hippolytus, do you imagine that the son, having a sense of right and justice, will join in his father's prayers?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">169</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I understand you to mean that a man should not desire or be in a hurry to have all things according to his wish, for his wish may be at variance with his reason.</div><div class="sentence"> But every state and every individual ought to pray and strive for wisdom.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">170</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; and I remember, and you will remember, what I said at first, that a statesman and legislator ought to ordain laws with a view to wisdom; while you were arguing that the good lawgiver ought to order all with a view to war.</div><div class="sentence"> And to this I replied that there were four virtues, but that upon your view one of them only was the aim of legislation; whereas you ought to regard all virtue, and especially that which comes first, and is the leader of all the rest—I mean wisdom and mind and opinion, having affection and desire in their train.</div><div class="sentence"> And now the argument returns to the same point, and I say once more, in jest if you like, or in earnest if you like, that the prayer of a fool is full of danger, being likely to end in the opposite of what he desires.</div><div class="sentence"> And if you would rather receive my words in earnest, I am willing that you should; and you will find, I suspect, as I have said already, that not cowardice was the cause of the ruin of the Dorian kings and of their whole design, nor ignorance of military matters, either on the part of the rulers or of their subjects; but their misfortunes were due to their general degeneracy, and especially to their ignorance of the most important human affairs.</div><div class="sentence"> That was then, and is still, and always will be the case, as I will endeavour, if you will allow me, to make out and demonstrate as well as I am able to you who are my friends, in the course of the argument.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">171</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Pray go on, Stranger;—compliments are troublesome, but we will show, not in word but in deed, how greatly we prize your words, for we will give them our best attention; and that is the way in which a freeman best shows his approval or disapproval.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">172</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Excellent, Cleinias; let us do as you say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">173</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  By all means, if Heaven wills.</div><div class="sentence"> Go on.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">174</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, proceeding in the same train of thought, I say that the greatest ignorance was the ruin of the Dorian power, and that now, as then, ignorance is ruin.</div><div class="sentence"> And if this be true, the legislator must endeavour to implant wisdom in states, and banish ignorance to the utmost of his power.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">175</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That is evident.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">176</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then now consider what is really the greatest ignorance.</div><div class="sentence"> I should like to know whether you and Megillus would agree with me in what I am about to say; for my opinion is—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">177</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">178</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  That the greatest ignorance is when a man hates that which he nevertheless thinks to be good and noble, and loves and embraces that which he knows to be unrighteous and evil.</div><div class="sentence"> This disagreement between the sense of pleasure and the judgment of reason in the soul is, in my opinion, the worst ignorance; and also the greatest, because affecting the great mass of the human soul; for the principle which feels pleasure and pain in the individual is like the mass or populace in a state.</div><div class="sentence"> And when the soul is opposed to knowledge, or opinion, or reason, which are her natural lords, that I call folly, just as in the state, when the multitude refuses to obey their rulers and the laws; or, again, in the individual, when fair reasonings have their habitation in the soul and yet do no good, but rather the reverse of good.</div><div class="sentence"> All these cases I term the worst ignorance, whether in individuals or in states.</div><div class="sentence"> You will understand, Stranger, that I am speaking of something which is very different from the ignorance of handicraftsmen.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">179</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, my friend, we understand and agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">180</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us, then, in the first place declare and affirm that the citizen who does not know these things ought never to have any kind of authority entrusted to him:  he must be stigmatized as ignorant, even though he be versed in calculation and skilled in all sorts of accomplishments, and feats of mental dexterity; and the opposite are to be called wise, even although, in the words of the proverb, they know neither how to read nor how to swim; and to them, as to men of sense, authority is to be committed.</div><div class="sentence"> For, O my friends, how can there be the least shadow of wisdom when there is no harmony?</div><div class="sentence"> There is none; but the noblest and greatest of harmonies may be truly said to be the greatest wisdom; and of this he is a partaker who lives according to reason; whereas he who is devoid of reason is the destroyer of his house and the very opposite of a saviour of the state:  he is utterly ignorant of political wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> Let this, then, as I was saying, be laid down by us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">181</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Let it be so laid down.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">182</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose that there must be rulers and subjects in states?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">183</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">184</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And what are the principles on which men rule and obey in cities, whether great or small; and similarly in families?</div><div class="sentence"> What are they, and how many in number?</div><div class="sentence"> Is there not one claim of authority which is always just,—that of fathers and mothers and in general of progenitors to rule over their offspring?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">185</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  There is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">186</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Next follows the principle that the noble should rule over the ignoble; and, thirdly, that the elder should rule and the younger obey?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">187</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">188</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And, fourthly, that slaves should be ruled, and their masters rule?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">189</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">190</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Fifthly, if I am not mistaken, comes the principle that the stronger shall rule, and the weaker be ruled?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">191</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That is a rule not to be disobeyed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">192</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, and a rule which prevails very widely among all creatures, and is according to nature, as the Theban poet Pindar once said; and the sixth principle, and the greatest of all, is, that the wise should lead and command, and the ignorant follow and obey; and yet, O thou most wise Pindar, as I should reply him, this surely is not contrary to nature, but according to nature, being the rule of law over willing subjects, and not a rule of compulsion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">193</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">194</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  There is a seventh kind of rule which is awarded by lot, and is dear to the Gods and a token of good fortune:  he on whom the lot falls is a ruler, and he who fails in obtaining the lot goes away and is the subject; and this we affirm to be quite just.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">195</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">196</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  'Then now,' as we say playfully to any of those who lightly undertake the making of laws, 'you see, legislator, the principles of government, how many they are, and that they are naturally opposed to each other.</div><div class="sentence"> There we have discovered a fountain-head of seditions, to which you must attend.</div><div class="sentence"> And, first, we will ask you to consider with us, how and in what respect the kings of Argos and Messene violated these our maxims, and ruined themselves and the great and famous Hellenic power of the olden time.</div><div class="sentence"> Was it because they did not know how wisely Hesiod spoke when he said that the half is often more than the whole?</div><div class="sentence"> His meaning was, that when to take the whole would be dangerous, and to take the half would be the safe and moderate course, then the moderate or better was more than the immoderate or worse.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">197</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">198</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And may we suppose this immoderate spirit to be more fatal when found among kings than when among peoples?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">199</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  The probability is that ignorance will be a disorder especially prevalent among kings, because they lead a proud and luxurious life.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">200</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Is it not palpable that the chief aim of the kings of that time was to get the better of the established laws, and that they were not in harmony with the principles which they had agreed to observe by word and oath?</div><div class="sentence"> This want of harmony may have had the appearance of wisdom, but was really, as we assert, the greatest ignorance, and utterly overthrew the whole empire by dissonance and harsh discord.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">201</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very likely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">202</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Good; and what measures ought the legislator to have then taken in order to avert this calamity?</div><div class="sentence"> Truly there is no great wisdom in knowing, and no great difficulty in telling, after the evil has happened; but to have foreseen the remedy at the time would have taken a much wiser head than ours.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">203</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">210</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  A God, who watched over Sparta, seeing into the future, gave you two families of kings instead of one; and thus brought you more within the limits of moderation.</div><div class="sentence"> In the next place, some human wisdom mingled with divine power, observing that the constitution of your government was still feverish and excited, tempered your inborn strength and pride of birth with the moderation which comes of age, making the power of your twenty-eight elders equal with that of the kings in the most important matters.</div><div class="sentence"> But your third saviour, perceiving that your government was still swelling and foaming, and desirous to impose a curb upon it, instituted the Ephors, whose power he made to resemble that of magistrates elected by lot; and by this arrangement the kingly office, being compounded of the right elements and duly moderated, was preserved, and was the means of preserving all the rest.</div><div class="sentence"> Since, if there had been only the original legislators, Temenus, Cresphontes, and their contemporaries, as far as they were concerned not even the portion of Aristodemus would have been preserved; for they had no proper experience in legislation, or they would surely not have imagined that oaths would moderate a youthful spirit invested with a power which might be converted into a tyranny.</div><div class="sentence"> Now that God has instructed us what sort of government would have been or will be lasting, there is no wisdom, as I have already said, in judging after the event; there is no difficulty in learning from an example which has already occurred.</div><div class="sentence"> But if any one could have foreseen all this at the time, and had been able to moderate the government of the three kingdoms and unite them into one, he might have saved all the excellent institutions which were then conceived; and no Persian or any other armament would have dared to attack us, or would have regarded Hellas as a power to be despised.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">232</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us note the rest of the story.</div><div class="sentence"> Observe, that Darius was not the son of a king, and had not received a luxurious education.</div><div class="sentence"> When he came to the throne, being one of the seven, he divided the country into seven portions, and of this arrangement there are some shadowy traces still remaining; he made laws upon the principle of introducing universal equality in the order of the state, and he embodied in his laws the settlement of the tribute which Cyrus promised,—thus creating a feeling of friendship and community among all the Persians, and attaching the people to him with money and gifts.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence his armies cheerfully acquired for him countries as large as those which Cyrus had left behind him.</div><div class="sentence"> Darius was succeeded by his son Xerxes; and he again was brought up in the royal and luxurious fashion.</div><div class="sentence"> Might we not most justly say:  'O Darius, how came you to bring up Xerxes in the same way in which Cyrus brought up Cambyses, and not to see his fatal mistake?'</div><div class="sentence"> For Xerxes, being the creation of the same education, met with much the same fortune as Cambyses; and from that time until now there has never been a really great king among the Persians, although they are all called Great.</div><div class="sentence"> And their degeneracy is not to be attributed to chance, as I maintain; the reason is rather the evil life which is generally led by the sons of very rich and royal persons; for never will boy or man, young or old, excel in virtue, who has been thus educated.</div><div class="sentence"> And this, I say, is what the legislator has to consider, and what at the present moment has to be considered by us.</div><div class="sentence"> Justly may you, O Lacedaemonians, be praised, in that you do not give special honour or a special education to wealth rather than to poverty, or to a royal rather than to a private station, where the divine and inspired lawgiver has not originally commanded them to be given.</div><div class="sentence"> For no man ought to have pre-eminent honour in a state because he surpasses others in wealth, any more than because he is swift of foot or fair or strong, unless he have some virtue in him; nor even if he have virtue, unless he have this particular virtue of temperance.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">272</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Consequent upon this freedom comes the other freedom, of disobedience to rulers (compare Republic); and then the attempt to escape the control and exhortation of father, mother, elders, and when near the end, the control of the laws also; and at the very end there is the contempt of oaths and pledges, and no regard at all for the Gods,—herein they exhibit and imitate the old so-called Titanic nature, and come to the same point as the Titans when they rebelled against God, leading a life of endless evils.</div><div class="sentence"> But why have I said all this?</div><div class="sentence"> I ask, because the argument ought to be pulled up from time to time, and not be allowed to run away, but held with bit and bridle, and then we shall not, as the proverb says, fall off our ass.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us then once more ask the question, To what end has all this been said?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">273</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">274</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  This, then, has been said for the sake—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">275</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of what?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">276</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  We were maintaining that the lawgiver ought to have three things in view:  first, that the city for which he legislates should be free; and secondly, be at unity with herself; and thirdly, should have understanding;—these were our principles, were they not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">277</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">278</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  With a view to this we selected two kinds of government, the one the most despotic, and the other the most free; and now we are considering which of them is the right form:  we took a mean in both cases, of despotism in the one, and of liberty in the other, and we saw that in a mean they attained their perfection; but that when they were carried to the extreme of either, slavery or licence, neither party were the gainers.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">279</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">280</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And that was our reason for considering the settlement of the Dorian army, and of the city built by Dardanus at the foot of the mountains, and the removal of cities to the seashore, and of our mention of the first men, who were the survivors of the deluge.</div><div class="sentence"> And all that was previously said about music and drinking, and what preceded, was said with the view of seeing how a state might be best administered, and how an individual might best order his own life.</div><div class="sentence"> And now, Megillus and Cleinias, how can we put to the proof the value of our words?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">281</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Stranger, I think that I see how a proof of their value may be obtained.</div><div class="sentence"> This discussion of ours appears to me to have been singularly fortunate, and just what I at this moment want; most auspiciously have you and my friend Megillus come in my way.</div><div class="sentence"> For I will tell you what has happened to me; and I regard the coincidence as a sort of omen.</div><div class="sentence"> The greater part of Crete is going to send out a colony, and they have entrusted the management of the affair to the Cnosians; and the Cnosian government to me and nine others.</div><div class="sentence"> And they desire us to give them any laws which we please, whether taken from the Cretan model or from any other; and they do not mind about their being foreign if they are better.</div><div class="sentence"> Grant me then this favour, which will also be a gain to yourselves: —Let us make a selection from what has been said, and then let us imagine a State of which we will suppose ourselves to be the original founders.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus we shall proceed with our enquiry, and, at the same time, I may have the use of the framework which you are constructing, for the city which is in contemplation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">282</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Good news, Cleinias; if Megillus has no objection, you may be sure that I will do all in my power to please you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">283</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Thank you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">284</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  And so will I.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">285</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Excellent; and now let us begin to frame the State.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And now, what will this city be?</div><div class="sentence"> I do not mean to ask what is or will hereafter be the name of the place; that may be determined by the accident of locality or of the original settlement—a river or fountain, or some local deity may give the sanction of a name to the newly-founded city; but I do want to know what the situation is, whether maritime or inland.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I should imagine, Stranger, that the city of which we are speaking is about eighty stadia distant from the sea.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And are there harbours on the seaboard?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Excellent harbours, Stranger; there could not be better.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Alas!</div><div class="sentence"> what a prospect!</div><div class="sentence"> And is the surrounding country productive, or in need of importations?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Hardly in need of anything.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And is there any neighbouring State?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  None whatever, and that is the reason for selecting the place; in days of old, there was a migration of the inhabitants, and the region has been deserted from time immemorial.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And has the place a fair proportion of hill, and plain, and wood?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Like the rest of Crete in that.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  You mean to say that there is more rock than plain?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then there is some hope that your citizens may be virtuous:  had you been on the sea, and well provided with harbours, and an importing rather than a producing country, some mighty saviour would have been needed, and lawgivers more than mortal, if you were ever to have a chance of preserving your state from degeneracy and discordance of manners (compare Ar.</div><div class="sentence"> Pol.).</div><div class="sentence"> But there is comfort in the eighty stadia; although the sea is too near, especially if, as you say, the harbours are so good.</div><div class="sentence"> Still we may be content.</div><div class="sentence"> The sea is pleasant enough as a daily companion, but has indeed also a bitter and brackish quality; filling the streets with merchants and shopkeepers, and begetting in the souls of men uncertain and unfaithful ways—making the state unfriendly and unfaithful both to her own citizens, and also to other nations.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a consolation, therefore, in the country producing all things at home; and yet, owing to the ruggedness of the soil, not providing anything in great abundance.</div><div class="sentence"> Had there been abundance, there might have been a great export trade, and a great return of gold and silver; which, as we may safely affirm, has the most fatal results on a State whose aim is the attainment of just and noble sentiments:  this was said by us, if you remember, in the previous discussion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I remember, and am of opinion that we both were and are in the right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but let me ask, how is the country supplied with timber for ship-building?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  There is no fir of any consequence, nor pine, and not much cypress; and you will find very little stone-pine or plane-wood, which shipwrights always require for the interior of ships.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  These are also natural advantages.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Why so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Because no city ought to be easily able to imitate its enemies in what is mischievous.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  How does that bear upon any of the matters of which we have been speaking?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Remember, my good friend, what I said at first about the Cretan laws, that they looked to one thing only, and this, as you both agreed, was war; and I replied that such laws, in so far as they tended to promote virtue, were good; but in that they regarded a part only, and not the whole of virtue, I disapproved of them.</div><div class="sentence"> And now I hope that you in your turn will follow and watch me if I legislate with a view to anything but virtue, or with a view to a part of virtue only.</div><div class="sentence"> For I consider that the true lawgiver, like an archer, aims only at that on which some eternal beauty is always attending, and dismisses everything else, whether wealth or any other benefit, when separated from virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> I was saying that the imitation of enemies was a bad thing; and I was thinking of a case in which a maritime people are harassed by enemies, as the Athenians were by Minos (I do not speak from any desire to recall past grievances); but he, as we know, was a great naval potentate, who compelled the inhabitants of Attica to pay him a cruel tribute; and in those days they had no ships of war as they now have, nor was the country filled with ship-timber, and therefore they could not readily build them.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence they could not learn how to imitate their enemy at sea, and in this way, becoming sailors themselves, directly repel their enemies.</div><div class="sentence"> Better for them to have lost many times over the seven youths, than that heavy-armed and stationary troops should have been turned into sailors, and accustomed to be often leaping on shore, and again to come running back to their ships; or should have fancied that there was no disgrace in not awaiting the attack of an enemy and dying boldly; and that there were good reasons, and plenty of them, for a man throwing away his arms, and betaking himself to flight,—which is not dishonourable, as people say, at certain times.</div><div class="sentence"> This is the language of naval warfare, and is anything but worthy of extraordinary praise.</div><div class="sentence"> For we should not teach bad habits, least of all to the best part of the citizens.</div><div class="sentence"> You may learn the evil of such a practice from Homer, by whom Odysseus is introduced, rebuking Agamemnon, because he desires to draw down the ships to the sea at a time when the Achaeans are hard pressed by the Trojans,—he gets angry with him, and says:</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span> <div class="sentence">  'Who, at a time when the battle is in full cry, biddest to drag the well-benched ships into the sea, that the prayers of the Trojans may be accomplished yet more, and high ruin fall upon us.</div><div class="sentence"> For the Achaeans will not maintain the battle, when the ships are drawn into the sea, but they will look behind and will cease from strife; in that the counsel which you give will prove injurious.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span> <div class="sentence">  You see that he quite knew triremes on the sea, in the neighbourhood of fighting men, to be an evil;—lions might be trained in that way to fly from a herd of deer.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover, naval powers which owe their safety to ships, do not give honour to that sort of warlike excellence which is most deserving of it.</div><div class="sentence"> For he who owes his safety to the pilot and the captain, and the oarsman, and all sorts of rather inferior persons, cannot rightly give honour to whom honour is due.</div><div class="sentence"> But how can a state be in a right condition which cannot justly award honour?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  It is hardly possible, I admit; and yet, Stranger, we Cretans are in the habit of saying that the battle of Salamis was the salvation of Hellas.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Why, yes; and that is an opinion which is widely spread both among Hellenes and barbarians.</div><div class="sentence"> But Megillus and I say rather, that the battle of Marathon was the beginning, and the battle of Plataea the completion, of the great deliverance, and that these battles by land made the Hellenes better; whereas the sea-fights of Salamis and Artemisium—for I may as well put them both together—made them no better, if I may say so without offence about the battles which helped to save us.</div><div class="sentence"> And in estimating the goodness of a state, we regard both the situation of the country and the order of the laws, considering that the mere preservation and continuance of life is not the most honourable thing for men, as the vulgar think, but the continuance of the best life, while we live; and that again, if I am not mistaken, is a remark which has been made already.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then we have only to ask, whether we are taking the course which we acknowledge to be the best for the settlement and legislation of states.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  The best by far.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And now let me proceed to another question:  Who are to be the colonists?</div><div class="sentence"> May any one come out of all Crete; and is the idea that the population in the several states is too numerous for the means of subsistence?</div><div class="sentence"> For I suppose that you are not going to send out a general invitation to any Hellene who likes to come.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet I observe that to your country settlers have come from Argos and Aegina and other parts of Hellas.</div><div class="sentence"> Tell me, then, whence do you draw your recruits in the present enterprise?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  They will come from all Crete; and of other Hellenes, Peloponnesians will be most acceptable.</div><div class="sentence"> For, as you truly observe, there are Cretans of Argive descent; and the race of Cretans which has the highest character at the present day is the Gortynian, and this has come from Gortys in the Peloponnesus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Cities find colonization in some respects easier if the colonists are one race, which like a swarm of bees is sent out from a single country, either when friends leave friends, owing to some pressure of population or other similar necessity, or when a portion of a state is driven by factions to emigrate.</div><div class="sentence"> And there have been whole cities which have taken flight when utterly conquered by a superior power in war.</div><div class="sentence"> This, however, which is in one way an advantage to the colonist or legislator, in another point of view creates a difficulty.</div><div class="sentence"> There is an element of friendship in the community of race, and language, and laws, and in common temples and rites of worship; but colonies which are of this homogeneous sort are apt to kick against any laws or any form of constitution differing from that which they had at home; and although the badness of their own laws may have been the cause of the factions which prevailed among them, yet from the force of habit they would fain preserve the very customs which were their ruin, and the leader of the colony, who is their legislator, finds them troublesome and rebellious.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, the conflux of several populations might be more disposed to listen to new laws; but then, to make them combine and pull together, as they say of horses, is a most difficult task, and the work of years.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet there is nothing which tends more to the improvement of mankind than legislation and colonization.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  No doubt; but I should like to know why you say so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  My good friend, I am afraid that the course of my speculations is leading me to say something depreciatory of legislators; but if the word be to the purpose, there can be no harm.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet, why am I disquieted, for I believe that the same principle applies equally to all human things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  To what are you referring?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I was going to say that man never legislates, but accidents of all sorts, which legislate for us in all sorts of ways.</div><div class="sentence"> The violence of war and the hard necessity of poverty are constantly overturning governments and changing laws.</div><div class="sentence"> And the power of disease has often caused innovations in the state, when there have been pestilences, or when there has been a succession of bad seasons continuing during many years.</div><div class="sentence"> Any one who sees all this, naturally rushes to the conclusion of which I was speaking, that no mortal legislates in anything, but that in human affairs chance is almost everything.</div><div class="sentence"> And this may be said of the arts of the sailor, and the pilot, and the physician, and the general, and may seem to be well said; and yet there is another thing which may be said with equal truth of all of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  That God governs all things, and that chance and opportunity co-operate with Him in the government of human affairs.</div><div class="sentence"> There is, however, a third and less extreme view, that art should be there also; for I should say that in a storm there must surely be a great advantage in having the aid of the pilot's art.</div><div class="sentence"> You would agree?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And does not a like principle apply to legislation as well as to other things:  even supposing all the conditions to be favourable which are needed for the happiness of the state, yet the true legislator must from time to time appear on the scene?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">040</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  In each case the artist would be able to pray rightly for certain conditions, and if these were granted by fortune, he would then only require to exercise his art?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">043</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And all the other artists just now mentioned, if they were bidden to offer up each their special prayer, would do so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">044</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And the legislator would do likewise?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">046</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I believe that he would.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">047</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  'Come, legislator,' we will say to him; 'what are the conditions which you require in a state before you can organize it?'</div><div class="sentence"> How ought he to answer this question?</div><div class="sentence"> Shall I give his answer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">048</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">049</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  He will say—'Give me a state which is governed by a tyrant, and let the tyrant be young and have a good memory; let him be quick at learning, and of a courageous and noble nature; let him have that quality which, as I said before, is the inseparable companion of all the other parts of virtue, if there is to be any good in them.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">050</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose, Megillus, that this companion virtue of which the Stranger speaks, must be temperance?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Cleinias, temperance in the vulgar sense; not that which in the forced and exaggerated language of some philosophers is called prudence, but that which is the natural gift of children and animals, of whom some live continently and others incontinently, but when isolated, was, as we said, hardly worth reckoning in the catalogue of goods.</div><div class="sentence"> I think that you must understand my meaning.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then our tyrant must have this as well as the other qualities, if the state is to acquire in the best manner and in the shortest time the form of government which is most conducive to happiness; for there neither is nor ever will be a better or speedier way of establishing a polity than by a tyranny.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  By what possible arguments, Stranger, can any man persuade himself of such a monstrous doctrine?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  There is surely no difficulty in seeing, Cleinias, what is in accordance with the order of nature?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  You would assume, as you say, a tyrant who was young, temperate, quick at learning, having a good memory, courageous, of a noble nature?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; and you must add fortunate; and his good fortune must be that he is the contemporary of a great legislator, and that some happy chance brings them together.</div><div class="sentence"> When this has been accomplished, God has done all that he ever does for a state which he desires to be eminently prosperous; He has done second best for a state in which there are two such rulers, and third best for a state in which there are three.</div><div class="sentence"> The difficulty increases with the increase, and diminishes with the diminution of the number.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  You mean to say, I suppose, that the best government is produced from a tyranny, and originates in a good lawgiver and an orderly tyrant, and that the change from such a tyranny into a perfect form of government takes place most easily; less easily when from an oligarchy; and, in the third degree, from a democracy:  is not that your meaning?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  It will be very necessary to hear about that.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">088</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I quite agree with you; and therefore I have introduced the subject.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Most appropriately; and since the tale is to the point, you will do well in giving us the whole story.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I will do as you suggest.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a tradition of the happy life of mankind in days when all things were spontaneous and abundant.</div><div class="sentence"> And of this the reason is said to have been as follows: —Cronos knew what we ourselves were declaring, that no human nature invested with supreme power is able to order human affairs and not overflow with insolence and wrong.</div><div class="sentence"> Which reflection led him to appoint not men but demigods, who are of a higher and more divine race, to be the kings and rulers of our cities; he did as we do with flocks of sheep and other tame animals.</div><div class="sentence"> For we do not appoint oxen to be the lords of oxen, or goats of goats; but we ourselves are a superior race, and rule over them.</div><div class="sentence"> In like manner God, in His love of mankind, placed over us the demons, who are a superior race, and they with great ease and pleasure to themselves, and no less to us, taking care of us and giving us peace and reverence and order and justice never failing, made the tribes of men happy and united.</div><div class="sentence"> And this tradition, which is true, declares that cities of which some mortal man and not God is the ruler, have no escape from evils and toils.</div><div class="sentence"> Still we must do all that we can to imitate the life which is said to have existed in the days of Cronos, and, as far as the principle of immortality dwells in us, to that we must hearken, both in private and public life, and regulate our cities and houses according to law, meaning by the very term 'law,' the distribution of mind.</div><div class="sentence"> But if either a single person or an oligarchy or a democracy has a soul eager after pleasures and desires—wanting to be filled with them, yet retaining none of them, and perpetually afflicted with an endless and insatiable disorder; and this evil spirit, having first trampled the laws under foot, becomes the master either of a state or of an individual,—then, as I was saying, salvation is hopeless.</div><div class="sentence"> And now, Cleinias, we have to consider whether you will or will not accept this tale of mine.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly we will.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  You are aware,—are you not?—that there are often said to be as many forms of laws as there are of governments, and of the latter we have already mentioned all those which are commonly recognized.</div><div class="sentence"> Now you must regard this as a matter of first-rate importance.</div><div class="sentence"> For what is to be the standard of just and unjust, is once more the point at issue.</div><div class="sentence"> Men say that the law ought not to regard either military virtue, or virtue in general, but only the interests and power and preservation of the established form of government; this is thought by them to be the best way of expressing the natural definition of justice.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Why, yes, this is one of those false principles of government to which we were referring.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Which do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Those which we were examining when we spoke of who ought to govern whom.</div><div class="sentence"> Did we not arrive at the conclusion that parents ought to govern their children, and the elder the younger, and the noble the ignoble?</div><div class="sentence"> And there were many other principles, if you remember, and they were not always consistent.</div><div class="sentence"> One principle was this very principle of might, and we said that Pindar considered violence natural and justified it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; I remember.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Consider, then, to whom our state is to be entrusted.</div><div class="sentence"> For there is a thing which has occurred times without number in states—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">109</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What thing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  That when there has been a contest for power, those who gain the upper hand so entirely monopolize the government, as to refuse all share to the defeated party and their descendants—they live watching one another, the ruling class being in perpetual fear that some one who has a recollection of former wrongs will come into power and rise up against them.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, according to our view, such governments are not polities at all, nor are laws right which are passed for the good of particular classes and not for the good of the whole state.</div><div class="sentence"> States which have such laws are not polities but parties, and their notions of justice are simply unmeaning.</div><div class="sentence"> I say this, because I am going to assert that we must not entrust the government in your state to any one because he is rich, or because he possesses any other advantage, such as strength, or stature, or again birth:  but he who is most obedient to the laws of the state, he shall win the palm; and to him who is victorious in the first degree shall be given the highest office and chief ministry of the gods; and the second to him who bears the second palm; and on a similar principle shall all the other offices be assigned to those who come next in order.</div><div class="sentence"> And when I call the rulers servants or ministers of the law, I give them this name not for the sake of novelty, but because I certainly believe that upon such service or ministry depends the well- or ill-being of the state.</div><div class="sentence"> For that state in which the law is subject and has no authority, I perceive to be on the highway to ruin; but I see that the state in which the law is above the rulers, and the rulers are the inferiors of the law, has salvation, and every blessing which the Gods can confer.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">115</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">116</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  'Friends,' we say to them,—'God, as the old tradition declares, holding in his hand the beginning, middle, and end of all that is, travels according to His nature in a straight line towards the accomplishment of His end.</div><div class="sentence"> Justice always accompanies Him, and is the punisher of those who fall short of the divine law.</div><div class="sentence"> To justice, he who would be happy holds fast, and follows in her company with all humility and order; but he who is lifted up with pride, or elated by wealth or rank, or beauty, who is young and foolish, and has a soul hot with insolence, and thinks that he has no need of any guide or ruler, but is able himself to be the guide of others, he, I say, is left deserted of God; and being thus deserted, he takes to him others who are like himself, and dances about, throwing all things into confusion, and many think that he is a great man, but in a short time he pays a penalty which justice cannot but approve, and is utterly destroyed, and his family and city with him.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore, seeing that human things are thus ordered, what should a wise man do or think, or not do or think'?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">117</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Every man ought to make up his mind that he will be one of the followers of God; there can be no doubt of that.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">118</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then what life is agreeable to God, and becoming in His followers?</div><div class="sentence"> One only, expressed once for all in the old saying that 'like agrees with like, with measure measure,' but things which have no measure agree neither with themselves nor with the things which have.</div><div class="sentence"> Now God ought to be to us the measure of all things, and not man (compare Crat.</div><div class="sentence"> ; Theaet.</div><div class="sentence"> ), as men commonly say (Protagoras):  the words are far more true of Him.</div><div class="sentence"> And he who would be dear to God must, as far as is possible, be like Him and such as He is.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore the temperate man is the friend of God, for he is like Him; and the intemperate man is unlike Him, and different from Him, and unjust.</div><div class="sentence"> And the same applies to other things; and this is the conclusion, which is also the noblest and truest of all sayings,—that for the good man to offer sacrifice to the Gods, and hold converse with them by means of prayers and offerings and every kind of service, is the noblest and best of all things, and also the most conducive to a happy life, and very fit and meet.</div><div class="sentence"> But with the bad man, the opposite of this is true:  for the bad man has an impure soul, whereas the good is pure; and from one who is polluted, neither a good man nor God can without impropriety receive gifts.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore the unholy do only waste their much service upon the Gods, but when offered by any holy man, such service is most acceptable to them.</div><div class="sentence"> This is the mark at which we ought to aim.</div><div class="sentence"> But what weapons shall we use, and how shall we direct them?</div><div class="sentence"> In the first place, we affirm that next after the Olympian Gods and the Gods of the State, honour should be given to the Gods below; they should receive everything in even numbers, and of the second choice, and ill omen, while the odd numbers, and the first choice, and the things of lucky omen, are given to the Gods above, by him who would rightly hit the mark of piety.</div><div class="sentence"> Next to these Gods, a wise man will do service to the demons or spirits, and then to the heroes, and after them will follow the private and ancestral Gods, who are worshipped as the law prescribes in the places which are sacred to them.</div><div class="sentence"> Next comes the honour of living parents, to whom, as is meet, we have to pay the first and greatest and oldest of all debts, considering that all which a man has belongs to those who gave him birth and brought him up, and that he must do all that he can to minister to them, first, in his property, secondly, in his person, and thirdly, in his soul, in return for the endless care and travail which they bestowed upon him of old, in the days of his infancy, and which he is now to pay back to them when they are old and in the extremity of their need.</div><div class="sentence"> And all his life long he ought never to utter, or to have uttered, an unbecoming word to them; for of light and fleeting words the penalty is most severe; Nemesis, the messenger of justice, is appointed to watch over all such matters.</div><div class="sentence"> When they are angry and want to satisfy their feelings in word or deed, he should give way to them; for a father who thinks that he has been wronged by his son may be reasonably expected to be very angry.</div><div class="sentence"> At their death, the most moderate funeral is best, neither exceeding the customary expense, nor yet falling short of the honour which has been usually shown by the former generation to their parents.</div><div class="sentence"> And let a man not forget to pay the yearly tribute of respect to the dead, honouring them chiefly by omitting nothing that conduces to a perpetual remembrance of them, and giving a reasonable portion of his fortune to the dead.</div><div class="sentence"> Doing this, and living after this manner, we shall receive our reward from the Gods and those who are above us (i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> the demons); and we shall spend our days for the most part in good hope.</div><div class="sentence"> And how a man ought to order what relates to his descendants and his kindred and friends and fellow-citizens, and the rites of hospitality taught by Heaven, and the intercourse which arises out of all these duties, with a view to the embellishment and orderly regulation of his own life—these things, I say, the laws, as we proceed with them, will accomplish, partly persuading, and partly when natures do not yield to the persuasion of custom, chastising them by might and right, and will thus render our state, if the Gods co-operate with us, prosperous and happy.</div><div class="sentence"> But of what has to be said, and must be said by the legislator who is of my way of thinking, and yet, if said in the form of law, would be out of place—of this I think that he may give a sample for the instruction of himself and of those for whom he is legislating; and then when, as far as he is able, he has gone through all the preliminaries, he may proceed to the work of legislation.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, what will be the form of such prefaces?</div><div class="sentence"> There may be a difficulty in including or describing them all under a single form, but I think that we may get some notion of them if we can guarantee one thing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">119</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">120</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I should wish the citizens to be as readily persuaded to virtue as possible; this will surely be the aim of the legislator in all his laws.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">122</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The proposal appears to me to be of some value; and I think that a person will listen with more gentleness and good-will to the precepts addressed to him by the legislator, when his soul is not altogether unprepared to receive them.</div><div class="sentence"> Even a little done in the way of conciliation gains his ear, and is always worth having.</div><div class="sentence"> For there is no great inclination or readiness on the part of mankind to be made as good, or as quickly good, as possible.</div><div class="sentence"> The case of the many proves the wisdom of Hesiod, who says that the road to wickedness is smooth and can be travelled without perspiring, because it is so very short:</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">123</span> <div class="sentence">  'But before virtue the immortal Gods have placed the sweat of labour, and long and steep is the way thither, and rugged at first; but when you have reached the top, although difficult before, it is then easy.'</div><div class="sentence"> (Works and Days.)</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">138</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">139</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And did you ever observe that there are two classes of patients in states, slaves and freemen; and the slave doctors run about and cure the slaves, or wait for them in the dispensaries—practitioners of this sort never talk to their patients individually, or let them talk about their own individual complaints?</div><div class="sentence"> The slave doctor prescribes what mere experience suggests, as if he had exact knowledge; and when he has given his orders, like a tyrant, he rushes off with equal assurance to some other servant who is ill; and so he relieves the master of the house of the care of his invalid slaves.</div><div class="sentence"> But the other doctor, who is a freeman, attends and practices upon freemen; and he carries his enquiries far back, and goes into the nature of the disorder; he enters into discourse with the patient and with his friends, and is at once getting information from the sick man, and also instructing him as far as he is able, and he will not prescribe for him until he has first convinced him; at last, when he has brought the patient more and more under his persuasive influences and set him on the road to health, he attempts to effect a cure.</div><div class="sentence"> Now which is the better way of proceeding in a physician and in a trainer?</div><div class="sentence"> Is he the better who accomplishes his ends in a double way, or he who works in one way, and that the ruder and inferior?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">140</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I should say, Stranger, that the double way is far better.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">147</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And, according to the true order, the laws relating to marriage should be those which are first determined in every state?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">148</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">149</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then let me first give the law of marriage in a simple form; it may run as follows: —A man shall marry between the ages of thirty and thirty-five, or, if he does not, he shall pay such and such a fine, or shall suffer the loss of such and such privileges.</div><div class="sentence"> This would be the simple law about marriage.</div><div class="sentence"> The double law would run thus: —A man shall marry between the ages of thirty and thirty-five, considering that in a manner the human race naturally partakes of immortality, which every man is by nature inclined to desire to the utmost; for the desire of every man that he may become famous, and not lie in the grave without a name, is only the love of continuance.</div><div class="sentence"> Now mankind are coeval with all time, and are ever following, and will ever follow, the course of time; and so they are immortal, because they leave children's children behind them, and partake of immortality in the unity of generation.</div><div class="sentence"> And for a man voluntarily to deprive himself of this gift, as he deliberately does who will not have a wife or children, is impiety.</div><div class="sentence"> He who obeys the law shall be free, and shall pay no fine; but he who is disobedient, and does not marry, when he has arrived at the age of thirty-five, shall pay a yearly fine of a certain amount, in order that he may not imagine his celibacy to bring ease and profit to him; and he shall not share in the honours which the young men in the state give to the aged.</div><div class="sentence"> Comparing now the two forms of the law, you will be able to arrive at a judgment about any other laws—whether they should be double in length even when shortest, because they have to persuade as well as threaten, or whether they shall only threaten and be of half the length.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">150</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  The shorter form, Stranger, would be more in accordance with Lacedaemonian custom; although, for my own part, if any one were to ask me which I myself prefer in the state, I should certainly determine in favour of the longer; and I would have every law made after the same pattern, if I had to choose.</div><div class="sentence"> But I think that Cleinias is the person to be consulted, for his is the state which is going to use these laws.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">151</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Thank you, Megillus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">152</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Whether, in the abstract, words are to be many or few, is a very foolish question; the best form, and not the shortest, is to be approved; nor is length at all to be regarded.</div><div class="sentence"> Of the two forms of law which have been recited, the one is not only twice as good in practical usefulness as the other, but the case is like that of the two kinds of doctors, which I was just now mentioning.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet legislators never appear to have considered that they have two instruments which they might use in legislation—persuasion and force; for in dealing with the rude and uneducated multitude, they use the one only as far as they can; they do not mingle persuasion with coercion, but employ force pure and simple.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover, there is a third point, sweet friends, which ought to be, and never is, regarded in our existing laws.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">153</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">154</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  A point arising out of our previous discussion, which comes into my mind in some mysterious way.</div><div class="sentence"> All this time, from early dawn until noon, have we been talking about laws in this charming retreat:  now we are going to promulgate our laws, and what has preceded was only the prelude of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Why do I mention this?</div><div class="sentence"> For this reason: —Because all discourses and vocal exercises have preludes and overtures, which are a sort of artistic beginnings intended to help the strain which is to be performed; lyric measures and music of every other kind have preludes framed with wonderful care.</div><div class="sentence"> But of the truer and higher strain of law and politics, no one has ever yet uttered any prelude, or composed or published any, as though there was no such thing in nature.</div><div class="sentence"> Whereas our present discussion seems to me to imply that there is;—these double laws, of which we were speaking, are not exactly double, but they are in two parts, the law and the prelude of the law.</div><div class="sentence"> The arbitrary command, which was compared to the commands of doctors, whom we described as of the meaner sort, was the law pure and simple; and that which preceded, and was described by our friend here as being hortatory only, was, although in fact, an exhortation, likewise analogous to the preamble of a discourse.</div><div class="sentence"> For I imagine that all this language of conciliation, which the legislator has been uttering in the preface of the law, was intended to create good-will in the person whom he addressed, in order that, by reason of this good-will, he might more intelligently receive his command, that is to say, the law.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore, in my way of speaking, this is more rightly described as the preamble than as the matter of the law.</div><div class="sentence"> And I must further proceed to observe, that to all his laws, and to each separately, the legislator should prefix a preamble; he should remember how great will be the difference between them, according as they have, or have not, such preambles, as in the case already given.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">155</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  The lawgiver, if he asks my opinion, will certainly legislate in the form which you advise.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">156</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I think that you are right, Cleinias, in affirming that all laws have preambles, and that throughout the whole of this work of legislation every single law should have a suitable preamble at the beginning; for that which is to follow is most important, and it makes all the difference whether we clearly remember the preambles or not.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet we should be wrong in requiring that all laws, small and great alike, should have preambles of the same kind, any more than all songs or speeches; although they may be natural to all, they are not always necessary, and whether they are to be employed or not has in each case to be left to the judgment of the speaker or the musician, or, in the present instance, of the lawgiver.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">157</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That I think is most true.</div><div class="sentence"> And now, Stranger, without delay let us return to the argument, and, as people say in play, make a second and better beginning, if you please, with the principles which we have been laying down, which we never thought of regarding as a preamble before, but of which we may now make a preamble, and not merely consider them to be chance topics of discourse.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us acknowledge, then, that we have a preamble.</div><div class="sentence"> About the honour of the Gods and the respect of parents, enough has been already said; and we may proceed to the topics which follow next in order, until the preamble is deemed by you to be complete; and after that you shall go through the laws themselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">158</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I understand you to mean that we have made a sufficient preamble about Gods and demigods, and about parents living or dead; and now you would have us bring the rest of the subject into the light of day?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">159</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">160</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  After this, as is meet and for the interest of us all, I the speaker, and you the listeners, will try to estimate all that relates to the souls and bodies and properties of the citizens, as regards both their occupations and amusements, and thus arrive, as far as in us lies, at the nature of education.</div><div class="sentence"> These then are the topics which follow next in order.</div></div>

<h2>BOOK V.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Listen, all ye who have just now heard the laws about Gods, and about our dear forefathers: —Of all the things which a man has, next to the Gods, his soul is the most divine and most truly his own.</div><div class="sentence"> Now in every man there are two parts:  the better and superior, which rules, and the worse and inferior, which serves; and the ruling part of him is always to be preferred to the subject.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore I am right in bidding every one next to the Gods, who are our masters, and those who in order follow them (i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> the demons), to honour his own soul, which every one seems to honour, but no one honours as he ought; for honour is a divine good, and no evil thing is honourable; and he who thinks that he can honour the soul by word or gift, or any sort of compliance, without making her in any way better, seems to honour her, but honours her not at all.</div><div class="sentence"> For example, every man, from his very boyhood, fancies that he is able to know everything, and thinks that he honours his soul by praising her, and he is very ready to let her do whatever she may like.</div><div class="sentence"> But I mean to say that in acting thus he injures his soul, and is far from honouring her; whereas, in our opinion, he ought to honour her as second only to the Gods.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, when a man thinks that others are to be blamed, and not himself, for the errors which he has committed from time to time, and the many and great evils which befell him in consequence, and is always fancying himself to be exempt and innocent, he is under the idea that he is honouring his soul; whereas the very reverse is the fact, for he is really injuring her.</div><div class="sentence"> And when, disregarding the word and approval of the legislator, he indulges in pleasure, then again he is far from honouring her; he only dishonours her, and fills her full of evil and remorse; or when he does not endure to the end the labours and fears and sorrows and pains which the legislator approves, but gives way before them, then, by yielding, he does not honour the soul, but by all such conduct he makes her to be dishonourable; nor when he thinks that life at any price is a good, does he honour her, but yet once more he dishonours her; for the soul having a notion that the world below is all evil, he yields to her, and does not resist and teach or convince her that, for aught she knows, the world of the Gods below, instead of being evil, may be the greatest of all goods.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, when any one prefers beauty to virtue, what is this but the real and utter dishonour of the soul?</div><div class="sentence"> For such a preference implies that the body is more honourable than the soul; and this is false, for there is nothing of earthly birth which is more honourable than the heavenly, and he who thinks otherwise of the soul has no idea how greatly he undervalues this wonderful possession; nor, again, when a person is willing, or not unwilling, to acquire dishonest gains, does he then honour his soul with gifts—far otherwise; he sells her glory and honour for a small piece of gold; but all the gold which is under or upon the earth is not enough to give in exchange for virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> In a word, I may say that he who does not estimate the base and evil, the good and noble, according to the standard of the legislator, and abstain in every possible way from the one and practise the other to the utmost of his power, does not know that in all these respects he is most foully and disgracefully abusing his soul, which is the divinest part of man; for no one, as I may say, ever considers that which is declared to be the greatest penalty of evil-doing—namely, to grow into the likeness of bad men, and growing like them to fly from the conversation of the good, and be cut off from them, and cleave to and follow after the company of the bad.</div><div class="sentence"> And he who is joined to them must do and suffer what such men by nature do and say to one another,—a suffering which is not justice but retribution; for justice and the just are noble, whereas retribution is the suffering which waits upon injustice; and whether a man escape or endure this, he is miserable,—in the former case, because he is not cured; while in the latter, he perishes in order that the rest of mankind may be saved.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Speaking generally, our glory is to follow the better and improve the inferior, which is susceptible of improvement, as far as this is possible.</div><div class="sentence"> And of all human possessions, the soul is by nature most inclined to avoid the evil, and track out and find the chief good; which when a man has found, he should take up his abode with it during the remainder of his life.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore the soul also is second (or next to God) in honour; and third, as every one will perceive, comes the honour of the body in natural order.</div><div class="sentence"> Having determined this, we have next to consider that there is a natural honour of the body, and that of honours some are true and some are counterfeit.</div><div class="sentence"> To decide which are which is the business of the legislator; and he, I suspect, would intimate that they are as follows:—Honour is not to be given to the fair body, or to the strong or the swift or the tall, or to the healthy body (although many may think otherwise), any more than to their opposites; but the mean states of all these habits are by far the safest and most moderate; for the one extreme makes the soul braggart and insolent, and the other, illiberal and base; and money, and property, and distinction all go to the same tune.</div><div class="sentence"> The excess of any of these things is apt to be a source of hatreds and divisions among states and individuals; and the defect of them is commonly a cause of slavery.</div><div class="sentence"> And, therefore, I would not have any one fond of heaping up riches for the sake of his children, in order that he may leave them as rich as possible.</div><div class="sentence"> For the possession of great wealth is of no use, either to them or to the state.</div><div class="sentence"> The condition of youth which is free from flattery, and at the same time not in need of the necessaries of life, is the best and most harmonious of all, being in accord and agreement with our nature, and making life to be most entirely free from sorrow.</div><div class="sentence"> Let parents, then, bequeath to their children not a heap of riches, but the spirit of reverence.</div><div class="sentence"> We, indeed, fancy that they will inherit reverence from us, if we rebuke them when they show a want of reverence.</div><div class="sentence"> But this quality is not really imparted to them by the present style of admonition, which only tells them that the young ought always to be reverential.</div><div class="sentence"> A sensible legislator will rather exhort the elders to reverence the younger, and above all to take heed that no young man sees or hears one of themselves doing or saying anything disgraceful; for where old men have no shame, there young men will most certainly be devoid of reverence.</div><div class="sentence"> The best way of training the young is to train yourself at the same time; not to admonish them, but to be always carrying out your own admonitions in practice.</div><div class="sentence"> He who honours his kindred, and reveres those who share in the same Gods and are of the same blood and family, may fairly expect that the Gods who preside over generation will be propitious to him, and will quicken his seed.</div><div class="sentence"> And he who deems the services which his friends and acquaintances do for him, greater and more important than they themselves deem them, and his own favours to them less than theirs to him, will have their good-will in the intercourse of life.</div><div class="sentence"> And surely in his relations to the state and his fellow citizens, he is by far the best, who rather than the Olympic or any other victory of peace or war, desires to win the palm of obedience to the laws of his country, and who, of all mankind, is the person reputed to have obeyed them best through life.</div><div class="sentence"> In his relations to strangers, a man should consider that a contract is a most holy thing, and that all concerns and wrongs of strangers are more directly dependent on the protection of God, than wrongs done to citizens; for the stranger, having no kindred and friends, is more to be pitied by Gods and men.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore, also, he who is most able to avenge him is most zealous in his cause; and he who is most able is the genius and the god of the stranger, who follow in the train of Zeus, the god of strangers.</div><div class="sentence"> And for this reason, he who has a spark of caution in him, will do his best to pass through life without sinning against the stranger.</div><div class="sentence"> And of offences committed, whether against strangers or fellow-countrymen, that against suppliants is the greatest.</div><div class="sentence"> For the God who witnessed to the agreement made with the suppliant, becomes in a special manner the guardian of the sufferer; and he will certainly not suffer unavenged.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Thus we have fairly described the manner in which a man is to act about his parents, and himself, and his own affairs; and in relation to the state, and his friends, and kindred, both in what concerns his own countrymen, and in what concerns the stranger.</div><div class="sentence"> We will now consider what manner of man he must be who would best pass through life in respect of those other things which are not matters of law, but of praise and blame only; in which praise and blame educate a man, and make him more tractable and amenable to the laws which are about to be imposed.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  Now, what lives are they, and how many in which, having searched out and beheld the objects of will and desire and their opposites, and making of them a law, choosing, I say, the dear and the pleasant and the best and noblest, a man may live in the happiest way possible?</div><div class="sentence"> Let us say that the temperate life is one kind of life, and the rational another, and the courageous another, and the healthful another; and to these four let us oppose four other lives—the foolish, the cowardly, the intemperate, the diseased.</div><div class="sentence"> He who knows the temperate life will describe it as in all things gentle, having gentle pains and gentle pleasures, and placid desires and loves not insane; whereas the intemperate life is impetuous in all things, and has violent pains and pleasures, and vehement and stinging desires, and loves utterly insane; and in the temperate life the pleasures exceed the pains, but in the intemperate life the pains exceed the pleasures in greatness and number and frequency.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence one of the two lives is naturally and necessarily more pleasant and the other more painful, and he who would live pleasantly cannot possibly choose to live intemperately.</div><div class="sentence"> And if this is true, the inference clearly is that no man is voluntarily intemperate; but that the whole multitude of men lack temperance in their lives, either from ignorance, or from want of self-control, or both.</div><div class="sentence"> And the same holds of the diseased and healthy life; they both have pleasures and pains, but in health the pleasure exceeds the pain, and in sickness the pain exceeds the pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> Now our intention in choosing the lives is not that the painful should exceed, but the life in which pain is exceeded by pleasure we have determined to be the more pleasant life.</div><div class="sentence"> And we should say that the temperate life has the elements both of pleasure and pain fewer and smaller and less frequent than the intemperate, and the wise life than the foolish life, and the life of courage than the life of cowardice; one of each pair exceeding in pleasure and the other in pain, the courageous surpassing the cowardly, and the wise exceeding the foolish.</div><div class="sentence"> And so the one class of lives exceeds the other class in pleasure; the temperate and courageous and wise and healthy exceed the cowardly and foolish and intemperate and diseased lives; and generally speaking, that which has any virtue, whether of body or soul, is pleasanter than the vicious life, and far superior in beauty and rectitude and excellence and reputation, and causes him who lives accordingly to be infinitely happier than the opposite.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  Enough of the preamble; and now the laws should follow; or, to speak more correctly, an outline of them.</div><div class="sentence"> As, then, in the case of a web or any other tissue, the warp and the woof cannot be made of the same materials (compare Statesman), but the warp is necessarily superior as being stronger, and having a certain character of firmness, whereas the woof is softer and has a proper degree of elasticity;—in a similar manner those who are to hold great offices in states, should be distinguished truly in each case from those who have been but slenderly proven by education.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us suppose that there are two parts in the constitution of a state—one the creation of offices, the other the laws which are assigned to them to administer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span> <div class="sentence">  But, before all this, comes the following consideration:—The shepherd or herdsman, or breeder of horses or the like, when he has received his animals will not begin to train them until he has first purified them in a manner which befits a community of animals; he will divide the healthy and unhealthy, and the good breed and the bad breed, and will send away the unhealthy and badly bred to other herds, and tend the rest, reflecting that his labours will be vain and have no effect, either on the souls or bodies of those whom nature and ill nurture have corrupted, and that they will involve in destruction the pure and healthy nature and being of every other animal, if he should neglect to purify them.</div><div class="sentence"> Now the case of other animals is not so important—they are only worth introducing for the sake of illustration; but what relates to man is of the highest importance; and the legislator should make enquiries, and indicate what is proper for each one in the way of purification and of any other procedure.</div><div class="sentence"> Take, for example, the purification of a city—there are many kinds of purification, some easier and others more difficult; and some of them, and the best and most difficult of them, the legislator, if he be also a despot, may be able to effect; but the legislator, who, not being a despot, sets up a new government and laws, even if he attempt the mildest of purgations, may think himself happy if he can complete his work.</div><div class="sentence"> The best kind of purification is painful, like similar cures in medicine, involving righteous punishment and inflicting death or exile in the last resort.</div><div class="sentence"> For in this way we commonly dispose of great sinners who are incurable, and are the greatest injury of the whole state.</div><div class="sentence"> But the milder form of purification is as follows:—when men who have nothing, and are in want of food, show a disposition to follow their leaders in an attack on the property of the rich—these, who are the natural plague of the state, are sent away by the legislator in a friendly spirit as far as he is able; and this dismissal of them is euphemistically termed a colony.</div><div class="sentence"> And every legislator should contrive to do this at once.</div><div class="sentence"> Our present case, however, is peculiar.</div><div class="sentence"> For there is no need to devise any colony or purifying separation under the circumstances in which we are placed.</div><div class="sentence"> But as, when many streams flow together from many sources, whether springs or mountain torrents, into a single lake, we ought to attend and take care that the confluent waters should be perfectly clear, and in order to effect this, should pump and draw off and divert impurities, so in every political arrangement there may be trouble and danger.</div><div class="sentence"> But, seeing that we are now only discoursing and not acting, let our selection be supposed to be completed, and the desired purity attained.</div><div class="sentence"> Touching evil men, who want to join and be citizens of our state, after we have tested them by every sort of persuasion and for a sufficient time, we will prevent them from coming; but the good we will to the utmost of our ability receive as friends with open arms.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span> <div class="sentence">  How then can we rightly order the distribution of the land?</div><div class="sentence"> In the first place, the number of the citizens has to be determined, and also the number and size of the divisions into which they will have to be formed; and the land and the houses will then have to be apportioned by us as fairly as we can.</div><div class="sentence"> The number of citizens can only be estimated satisfactorily in relation to the territory and the neighbouring states.</div><div class="sentence"> The territory must be sufficient to maintain a certain number of inhabitants in a moderate way of life—more than this is not required; and the number of citizens should be sufficient to defend themselves against the injustice of their neighbours, and also to give them the power of rendering efficient aid to their neighbours when they are wronged.</div><div class="sentence"> After having taken a survey of their's and their neighbours' territory, we will determine the limits of them in fact as well as in theory.</div><div class="sentence"> And now, let us proceed to legislate with a view to perfecting the form and outline of our state.</div><div class="sentence"> The number of our citizens shall be 5040—this will be a convenient number; and these shall be owners of the land and protectors of the allotment.</div><div class="sentence"> The houses and the land will be divided in the same way, so that every man may correspond to a lot.</div><div class="sentence"> Let the whole number be first divided into two parts, and then into three; and the number is further capable of being divided into four or five parts, or any number of parts up to ten.</div><div class="sentence"> Every legislator ought to know so much arithmetic as to be able to tell what number is most likely to be useful to all cities; and we are going to take that number which contains the greatest and most regular and unbroken series of divisions.</div><div class="sentence"> The whole of number has every possible division, and the number 5040 can be divided by exactly fifty-nine divisors, and ten of these proceed without interval from one to ten: this will furnish numbers for war and peace, and for all contracts and dealings, including taxes and divisions of the land.</div><div class="sentence"> These properties of number should be ascertained at leisure by those who are bound by law to know them; for they are true, and should be proclaimed at the foundation of the city, with a view to use.</div><div class="sentence"> Whether the legislator is establishing a new state or restoring an old and decayed one, in respect of Gods and temples,—the temples which are to be built in each city, and the Gods or demi-gods after whom they are to be called,—if he be a man of sense, he will make no change in anything which the oracle of Delphi, or Dodona, or the God Ammon, or any ancient tradition has sanctioned in whatever manner, whether by apparitions or reputed inspiration of Heaven, in obedience to which mankind have established sacrifices in connexion with mystic rites, either originating on the spot, or derived from Tyrrhenia or Cyprus or some other place, and on the strength of which traditions they have consecrated oracles and images, and altars and temples, and portioned out a sacred domain for each of them.</div><div class="sentence"> The least part of all these ought not to be disturbed by the legislator; but he should assign to the several districts some God, or demi-god, or hero, and, in the distribution of the soil, should give to these first their chosen domain and all things fitting, that the inhabitants of the several districts may meet at fixed times, and that they may readily supply their various wants, and entertain one another with sacrifices, and become friends and acquaintances; for there is no greater good in a state than that the citizens should be known to one another.</div><div class="sentence"> When not light but darkness and ignorance of each other's characters prevails among them, no one will receive the honour of which he is deserving, or the power or the justice to which he is fairly entitled: wherefore, in every state, above all things, every man should take heed that he have no deceit in him, but that he be always true and simple; and that no deceitful person take any advantage of him.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span> <div class="sentence">  Let the citizens at once distribute their land and houses, and not till the land in common, since a community of goods goes beyond their proposed origin, and nurture, and education.</div><div class="sentence"> But in making the distribution, let the several possessors feel that their particular lots also belong to the whole city; and seeing that the earth is their parent, let them tend her more carefully than children do their mother.</div><div class="sentence"> For she is a goddess and their queen, and they are her mortal subjects.</div><div class="sentence"> Such also are the feelings which they ought to entertain to the Gods and demi-gods of the country.</div><div class="sentence"> And in order that the distribution may always remain, they ought to consider further that the present number of families should be always retained, and neither increased nor diminished.</div><div class="sentence"> This may be secured for the whole city in the following manner:—Let the possessor of a lot leave the one of his children who is his best beloved, and one only, to be the heir of his dwelling, and his successor in the duty of ministering to the Gods, the state and the family, as well the living members of it as those who are departed when he comes into the inheritance; but of his other children, if he have more than one, he shall give the females in marriage according to the law to be hereafter enacted, and the males he shall distribute as sons to those citizens who have no children, and are disposed to receive them; or if there should be none such, and particular individuals have too many children, male or female, or too few, as in the case of barrenness—in all these cases let the highest and most honourable magistracy created by us judge and determine what is to be done with the redundant or deficient, and devise a means that the number of 5040 houses shall always remain the same.</div><div class="sentence"> There are many ways of regulating numbers; for they in whom generation is affluent may be made to refrain (compare Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Pol.</div><div class="sentence"> ), and, on the other hand, special care may be taken to increase the number of births by rewards and stigmas, or we may meet the evil by the elder men giving advice and administering rebuke to the younger—in this way the object may be attained.</div><div class="sentence"> And if after all there be very great difficulty about the equal preservation of the 5040 houses, and there be an excess of citizens, owing to the too great love of those who live together, and we are at our wits' end, there is still the old device often mentioned by us of sending out a colony, which will part friends with us, and be composed of suitable persons.</div><div class="sentence"> If, on the other hand, there come a wave bearing a deluge of disease, or a plague of war, and the inhabitants become much fewer than the appointed number by reason of bereavement, we ought not to introduce citizens of spurious birth and education, if this can be avoided; but even God is said not to be able to fight against necessity.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span> <div class="sentence">  Wherefore let us suppose this 'high argument' of ours to address us in the following terms:—Best of men, cease not to honour according to nature similarity and equality and sameness and agreement, as regards number and every good and noble quality.</div><div class="sentence"> And, above all, observe the aforesaid number 5040 throughout life; in the second place, do not disparage the small and modest proportions of the inheritances which you received in the distribution, by buying and selling them to one another.</div><div class="sentence"> For then neither will the God who gave you the lot be your friend, nor will the legislator; and indeed the law declares to the disobedient that these are the terms upon which he may or may not take the lot.</div><div class="sentence"> In the first place, the earth as he is informed is sacred to the Gods; and in the next place, priests and priestesses will offer up prayers over a first, and second, and even a third sacrifice, that he who buys or sells the houses or lands which he has received, may suffer the punishment which he deserves; and these their prayers they shall write down in the temples, on tablets of cypress-wood, for the instruction of posterity.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover they will set a watch over all these things, that they may be observed;—the magistracy which has the sharpest eyes shall keep watch that any infringement of these commands may be discovered and punished as offences both against the law and the God.</div><div class="sentence"> How great is the benefit of such an ordinance to all those cities, which obey and are administered accordingly, no bad man can ever know, as the old proverb says; but only a man of experience and good habits.</div><div class="sentence"> For in such an order of things there will not be much opportunity for making money; no man either ought, or indeed will be allowed, to exercise any ignoble occupation, of which the vulgarity is a matter of reproach to a freeman, and should never want to acquire riches by any such means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span> <div class="sentence">  Further, the law enjoins that no private man shall be allowed to possess gold and silver, but only coin for daily use, which is almost necessary in dealing with artisans, and for payment of hirelings, whether slaves or immigrants, by all those persons who require the use of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore our citizens, as we say, should have a coin passing current among themselves, but not accepted among the rest of mankind; with a view, however, to expeditions and journeys to other lands,—for embassies, or for any other occasion which may arise of sending out a herald, the state must also possess a common Hellenic currency.</div><div class="sentence"> If a private person is ever obliged to go abroad, let him have the consent of the magistrates and go; and if when he returns he has any foreign money remaining, let him give the surplus back to the treasury, and receive a corresponding sum in the local currency.</div><div class="sentence"> And if he is discovered to appropriate it, let it be confiscated, and let him who knows and does not inform be subject to curse and dishonour equally him who brought the money, and also to a fine not less in amount than the foreign money which has been brought back.</div><div class="sentence"> In marrying and giving in marriage, no one shall give or receive any dowry at all; and no one shall deposit money with another whom he does not trust as a friend, nor shall he lend money upon interest; and the borrower should be under no obligation to repay either capital or interest.</div><div class="sentence"> That these principles are best, any one may see who compares them with the first principle and intention of a state.</div><div class="sentence"> The intention, as we affirm, of a reasonable statesman, is not what the many declare to be the object of a good legislator, namely, that the state for the true interests of which he is advising should be as great and as rich as possible, and should possess gold and silver, and have the greatest empire by sea and land;—this they imagine to be the real object of legislation, at the same time adding, inconsistently, that the true legislator desires to have the city the best and happiest possible.</div><div class="sentence"> But they do not see that some of these things are possible, and some of them are impossible; and he who orders the state will desire what is possible, and will not indulge in vain wishes or attempts to accomplish that which is impossible.</div><div class="sentence"> The citizen must indeed be happy and good, and the legislator will seek to make him so; but very rich and very good at the same time he cannot be, not, at least, in the sense in which the many speak of riches.</div><div class="sentence"> For they mean by 'the rich' the few who have the most valuable possessions, although the owner of them may quite well be a rogue.</div><div class="sentence"> And if this is true, I can never assent to the doctrine that the rich man will be happy—he must be good as well as rich.</div><div class="sentence"> And good in a high degree, and rich in a high degree at the same time, he cannot be.</div><div class="sentence"> Some one will ask, why not?</div><div class="sentence"> And we shall answer—Because acquisitions which come from sources which are just and unjust indifferently, are more than double those which come from just sources only; and the sums which are expended neither honourably nor disgracefully, are only half as great as those which are expended honourably and on honourable purposes.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus, if the one acquires double and spends half, the other who is in the opposite case and is a good man cannot possibly be wealthier than he.</div><div class="sentence"> The first—I am speaking of the saver and not of the spender—is not always bad; he may indeed in some cases be utterly bad, but, as I was saying, a good man he never is.</div><div class="sentence"> For he who receives money unjustly as well as justly, and spends neither nor unjustly, will be a rich man if he be also thrifty.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, the utterly bad is in general profligate, and therefore very poor; while he who spends on noble objects, and acquires wealth by just means only, can hardly be remarkable for riches, any more than he can be very poor.</div><div class="sentence"> Our statement, then, is true, that the very rich are not good, and, if they are not good, they are not happy.</div><div class="sentence"> But the intention of our laws was, that the citizens should be as happy as may be, and as friendly as possible to one another.</div><div class="sentence"> And men who are always at law with one another, and amongst whom there are many wrongs done, can never be friends to one another, but only those among whom crimes and lawsuits are few and slight.</div><div class="sentence"> Therefore we say that gold and silver ought not to be allowed in the city, nor much of the vulgar sort of trade which is carried on by lending money, or rearing the meaner kinds of live stock; but only the produce of agriculture, and only so much of this as will not compel us in pursuing it to neglect that for the sake of which riches exist—I mean, soul and body, which without gymnastics, and without education, will never be worth anything; and therefore, as we have said not once but many times, the care of riches should have the last place in our thoughts.</div><div class="sentence"> For there are in all three things about which every man has an interest; and the interest about money, when rightly regarded, is the third and lowest of them: midway comes the interest of the body; and, first of all, that of the soul; and the state which we are describing will have been rightly constituted if it ordains honours according to this scale.</div><div class="sentence"> But if, in any of the laws which have been ordained, health has been preferred to temperance, or wealth to health and temperate habits, that law must clearly be wrong.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore, also, the legislator ought often to impress upon himself the question—'What do I want?'</div><div class="sentence"> and 'Do I attain my aim, or do I miss the mark?'</div><div class="sentence"> In this way, and in this way only, he may acquit himself and free others from the work of legislation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span> <div class="sentence">  Let the allottee then hold his lot upon the conditions which we have mentioned.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span> <div class="sentence">  It would be well that every man should come to the colony having all things equal; but seeing that this is not possible, and one man will have greater possessions than another, for many reasons and in particular in order to preserve equality in special crises of the state, qualifications of property must be unequal, in order that offices and contributions and distributions may be proportioned to the value of each person's wealth, and not solely to the virtue of his ancestors or himself, nor yet to the strength and beauty of his person, but also to the measure of his wealth or poverty; and so by a law of inequality, which will be in proportion to his wealth, he will receive honours and offices as equally as possible, and there will be no quarrels and disputes.</div><div class="sentence"> To which end there should be four different standards appointed according to the amount of property: there should be a first and a second and a third and a fourth class, in which the citizens will be placed, and they will be called by these or similar names: they may continue in the same rank, or pass into another in any individual case, on becoming richer from being poorer, or poorer from being richer.</div><div class="sentence"> The form of law which I should propose as the natural sequel would be as follows:—In a state which is desirous of being saved from the greatest of all plagues—not faction, but rather distraction;—there should exist among the citizens neither extreme poverty, nor, again, excess of wealth, for both are productive of both these evils.</div><div class="sentence"> Now the legislator should determine what is to be the limit of poverty or wealth.</div><div class="sentence"> Let the limit of poverty be the value of the lot; this ought to be preserved, and no ruler, nor any one else who aspires after a reputation for virtue, will allow the lot to be impaired in any case.</div><div class="sentence"> This the legislator gives as a measure, and he will permit a man to acquire double or triple, or as much as four times the amount of this (compare Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Pol.).</div><div class="sentence"> But if a person have yet greater riches, whether he has found them, or they have been given to him, or he has made them in business, or has acquired by any stroke of fortune that which is in excess of the measure, if he give back the surplus to the state, and to the Gods who are the patrons of the state, he shall suffer no penalty or loss of reputation; but if he disobeys this our law, any one who likes may inform against him and receive half the value of the excess, and the delinquent shall pay a sum equal to the excess out of his own property, and the other half of the excess shall belong to the Gods.</div><div class="sentence"> And let every possession of every man, with the exception of the lot, be publicly registered before the magistrates whom the law appoints, so that all suits about money may be easy and quite simple.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span> <div class="sentence">  The next thing to be noted is, that the city should be placed as nearly as possible in the centre of the country; we should choose a place which possesses what is suitable for a city, and this may easily be imagined and described.</div><div class="sentence"> Then we will divide the city into twelve portions, first founding temples to Hestia, to Zeus and to Athene, in a spot which we will call the Acropolis, and surround with a circular wall, making the division of the entire city and country radiate from this point.</div><div class="sentence"> The twelve portions shall be equalized by the provision that those which are of good land shall be smaller, while those of inferior quality shall be larger.</div><div class="sentence"> The number of the lots shall be 5040, and each of them shall be divided into two, and every allotment shall be composed of two such sections; one of land near the city, the other of land which is at a distance (compare Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Pol.).</div><div class="sentence"> This arrangement shall be carried out in the following manner: The section which is near the city shall be added to that which is on the borders, and form one lot, and the portion which is next nearest shall be added to the portion which is next farthest; and so of the rest.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover, in the two sections of the lots the same principle of equalization of the soil ought to be maintained; the badness and goodness shall be compensated by more and less.</div><div class="sentence"> And the legislator shall divide the citizens into twelve parts, and arrange the rest of their property, as far as possible, so as to form twelve equal parts; and there shall be a registration of all.</div><div class="sentence"> After this they shall assign twelve lots to twelve Gods, and call them by their names, and dedicate to each God their several portions, and call the tribes after them.</div><div class="sentence"> And they shall distribute the twelve divisions of the city in the same way in which they divided the country; and every man shall have two habitations, one in the centre of the country, and the other at the extremity.</div><div class="sentence"> Enough of the manner of settlement.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span> <div class="sentence">  Now we ought by all means to consider that there can never be such a happy concurrence of circumstances as we have described; neither can all things coincide as they are wanted.</div><div class="sentence"> Men who will not take offence at such a mode of living together, and will endure all their life long to have their property fixed at a moderate limit, and to beget children in accordance with our ordinances, and will allow themselves to be deprived of gold and other things which the legislator, as is evident from these enactments, will certainly forbid them; and will endure, further, the situation of the land with the city in the middle and dwellings round about;—all this is as if the legislator were telling his dreams, or making a city and citizens of wax.</div><div class="sentence"> There is truth in these objections, and therefore every one should take to heart what I am going to say.</div><div class="sentence"> Once more, then, the legislator shall appear and address us:—'O my friends,' he will say to us, 'do not suppose me ignorant that there is a certain degree of truth in your words; but I am of opinion that, in matters which are not present but future, he who exhibits a pattern of that at which he aims, should in nothing fall short of the fairest and truest; and that if he finds any part of this work impossible of execution he should avoid and not execute it, but he should contrive to carry out that which is nearest and most akin to it; you must allow the legislator to perfect his design, and when it is perfected, you should join with him in considering what part of his legislation is expedient and what will arouse opposition; for surely the artist who is to be deemed worthy of any regard at all, ought always to make his work self-consistent.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span> <div class="sentence">  Having determined that there is to be a distribution into twelve parts, let us now see in what way this may be accomplished.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no difficulty in perceiving that the twelve parts admit of the greatest number of divisions of that which they include, or in seeing the other numbers which are consequent upon them, and are produced out of them up to 5040; wherefore the law ought to order phratries and demes and villages, and also military ranks and movements, as well as coins and measures, dry and liquid, and weights, so as to be commensurable and agreeable to one another.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor should we fear the appearance of minuteness, if the law commands that all the vessels which a man possesses should have a common measure, when we consider generally that the divisions and variations of numbers have a use in respect of all the variations of which they are susceptible, both in themselves and as measures of height and depth, and in all sounds, and in motions, as well those which proceed in a straight direction, upwards or downwards, as in those which go round and round.</div><div class="sentence"> The legislator is to consider all these things and to bid the citizens, as far as possible, not to lose sight of numerical order; for no single instrument of youthful education has such mighty power, both as regards domestic economy and politics, and in the arts, as the study of arithmetic.</div><div class="sentence"> Above all, arithmetic stirs up him who is by nature sleepy and dull, and makes him quick to learn, retentive, shrewd, and aided by art divine he makes progress quite beyond his natural powers (compare Republic).</div><div class="sentence"> All such things, if only the legislator, by other laws and institutions, can banish meanness and covetousness from the souls of men, so that they can use them properly and to their own good, will be excellent and suitable instruments of education.</div><div class="sentence"> But if he cannot, he will unintentionally create in them, instead of wisdom, the habit of craft, which evil tendency may be observed in the Egyptians and Phoenicians, and many other races, through the general vulgarity of their pursuits and acquisitions, whether some unworthy legislator of theirs has been the cause, or some impediment of chance or nature.</div><div class="sentence"> For we must not fail to observe, O Megillus and Cleinias, that there is a difference in places, and that some beget better men and others worse; and we must legislate accordingly.</div><div class="sentence"> Some places are subject to strange and fatal influences by reason of diverse winds and violent heats, some by reason of waters; or, again, from the character of the food given by the earth, which not only affects the bodies of men for good or evil, but produces similar results in their souls.</div><div class="sentence"> And in all such qualities those spots excel in which there is a divine inspiration, and in which the demigods have their appointed lots, and are propitious, not adverse, to the settlers in them.</div><div class="sentence"> To all these matters the legislator, if he have any sense in him, will attend as far as man can, and frame his laws accordingly.</div><div class="sentence"> And this is what you, Cleinias, must do, and to matters of this kind you must turn your mind since you are going to colonize a new country.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  In the ordering of a state there are two parts:  first, the number of the magistracies, and the mode of establishing them; and, secondly, when they have been established, laws again will have to be provided for each of them, suitable in nature and number.</div><div class="sentence"> But before electing the magistrates let us stop a little and say a word in season about the election of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What have you got to say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  This is what I have to say;—every one can see, that although the work of legislation is a most important matter, yet if a well-ordered city superadd to good laws unsuitable offices, not only will there be no use in having the good laws,—not only will they be ridiculous and useless, but the greatest political injury and evil will accrue from them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then now, my friend, let us observe what will happen in the constitution of out intended state.</div><div class="sentence"> In the first place, you will acknowledge that those who are duly appointed to magisterial power, and their families, should severally have given satisfactory proof of what they are, from youth upward until the time of election; in the next place, those who are to elect should have been trained in habits of law, and be well educated, that they may have a right judgment, and may be able to select or reject men whom they approve or disapprove, as they are worthy of either.</div><div class="sentence"> But how can we imagine that those who are brought together for the first time, and are strangers to one another, and also uneducated, will avoid making mistakes in the choice of magistrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; and I will be as good as my word.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Let us by all means do as you propose.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  That we will, by the grace of God, if old age will only permit us.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; and under his guidance let us consider a further point.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us remember what a courageously mad and daring creation this our city is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What had you in your mind when you said that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I had in my mind the free and easy manner in which we are ordaining that the inexperienced colonists shall receive our laws.</div><div class="sentence"> Now a man need not be very wise, Cleinias, in order to see that no one can easily receive laws at their first imposition.</div><div class="sentence"> But if we could anyhow wait until those who have been imbued with them from childhood, and have been nurtured in them, and become habituated to them, take their part in the public elections of the state; I say, if this could be accomplished, and rightly accomplished by any way or contrivance—then, I think that there would be very little danger, at the end of the time, of a state thus trained not being permanent.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  A reasonable supposition.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then let us consider if we can find any way out of the difficulty; for I maintain, Cleinias, that the Cnosians, above all the other Cretans, should not be satisfied with barely discharging their duty to the colony, but they ought to take the utmost pains to establish the offices which are first created by them in the best and surest manner.</div><div class="sentence"> Above all, this applies to the selection of the guardians of the law, who must be chosen first of all, and with the greatest care; the others are of less importance.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What method can we devise of electing them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  This will be the method: —Sons of the Cretans, I shall say to them, inasmuch as the Cnosians have precedence over the other states, they should, in common with those who join this settlement, choose a body of thirty-seven in all, nineteen of them being taken from the settlers, and the remainder from the citizens of Cnosus.</div><div class="sentence"> Of these latter the Cnosians shall make a present to your colony, and you yourself shall be one of the eighteen, and shall become a citizen of the new state; and if you and they cannot be persuaded to go, the Cnosians may fairly use a little violence in order to make you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  But why, Stranger, do not you and Megillus take a part in our new city?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  O, Cleinias, Athens is proud, and Sparta too; and they are both a long way off.</div><div class="sentence"> But you and likewise the other colonists are conveniently situated as you describe.</div><div class="sentence"> I have been speaking of the way in which the new citizens may be best managed under present circumstances; but in after-ages, if the city continues to exist, let the election be on this wise.</div><div class="sentence"> All who are horse or foot soldiers, or have seen military service at the proper ages when they were severally fitted for it (compare Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Pol.</div><div class="sentence"> ), shall share in the election of magistrates; and the election shall be held in whatever temple the state deems most venerable, and every one shall carry his vote to the altar of the God, writing down on a tablet the name of the person for whom he votes, and his father's name, and his tribe, and ward; and at the side he shall write his own name in like manner.</div><div class="sentence"> Any one who pleases may take away any tablet which he does not think properly filled up, and exhibit it in the Agora for a period of not less than thirty days.</div><div class="sentence"> The tablets which are judged to be first, to the number of 300, shall be shown by the magistrates to the whole city, and the citizens shall in like manner select from these the candidates whom they prefer; and this second selection, to the number of 100, shall be again exhibited to the citizens; in the third, let any one who pleases select whom he pleases out of the 100, walking through the parts of victims, and let them choose for magistrates and proclaim the seven-and-thirty who have the greatest number of votes.</div><div class="sentence"> But who, Cleinias and Megillus, will order for us in the colony all this matter of the magistrates, and the scrutinies of them?</div><div class="sentence"> If we reflect, we shall see that cities which are in process of construction like ours must have some such persons, who cannot possibly be elected before there are any magistrates; and yet they must be elected in some way, and they are not to be inferior men, but the best possible.</div><div class="sentence"> For as the proverb says, 'a good beginning is half the business'; and 'to have begun well' is praised by all, and in my opinion is a great deal more than half the business, and has never been praised by any one enough.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That is very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then let us recognize the difficulty, and make clear to our own minds how the beginning is to be accomplished.</div><div class="sentence"> There is only one proposal which I have to offer, and that is one which, under our circumstances, is both necessary and expedient.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I maintain that this colony of ours has a father and mother, who are no other than the colonizing state.</div><div class="sentence"> Well I know that many colonies have been, and will be, at enmity with their parents.</div><div class="sentence"> But in early days the child, as in a family, loves and is beloved; even if there come a time later when the tie is broken, still, while he is in want of education, he naturally loves his parents and is beloved by them, and flies to his relatives for protection, and finds in them his only natural allies in time of need; and this parental feeling already exists in the Cnosians, as is shown by their care of the new city; and there is a similar feeling on the part of the young city towards Cnosus.</div><div class="sentence"> And I repeat what I was saying—for there is no harm in repeating a good thing—that the Cnosians should take a common interest in all these matters, and choose, as far as they can, the eldest and best of the colonists, to the number of not less than a hundred; and let there be another hundred of the Cnosians themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> These, I say, on their arrival, should have a joint care that the magistrates should be appointed according to law, and that when they are appointed they should undergo a scrutiny.</div><div class="sentence"> When this has been effected, the Cnosians shall return home, and the new city do the best she can for her own preservation and happiness.</div><div class="sentence"> I would have the seven-and-thirty now, and in all future time, chosen to fulfil the following duties: —Let them, in the first place, be the guardians of the law; and, secondly, of the registers in which each one registers before the magistrate the amount of his property, excepting four minae which are allowed to citizens of the first class, three allowed to the second, two to the third, and a single mina to the fourth.</div><div class="sentence"> And if any one, despising the laws for the sake of gain, be found to possess anything more which has not been registered, let all that he has in excess be confiscated, and let him be liable to a suit which shall be the reverse of honourable or fortunate.</div><div class="sentence"> And let any one who will, indict him on the charge of loving base gains, and proceed against him before the guardians of the law.</div><div class="sentence"> And if he be cast, let him lose his share of the public possessions, and when there is any public distribution, let him have nothing but his original lot; and let him be written down a condemned man as long as he lives, in some place in which any one who pleases can read about his offences.</div><div class="sentence"> The guardian of the law shall not hold office longer than twenty years, and shall not be less than fifty years of age when he is elected; or if he is elected when he is sixty years of age, he shall hold office for ten years only; and upon the same principle, he must not imagine that he will be permitted to hold such an important office as that of guardian of the laws after he is seventy years of age, if he live so long.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span> <div class="sentence">  These are the three first ordinances about the guardians of the law; as the work of legislation progresses, each law in turn will assign to them their further duties.</div><div class="sentence"> And now we may proceed in order to speak of the election of other officers; for generals have to be elected, and these again must have their ministers, commanders, and colonels of horse, and commanders of brigades of foot, who would be more rightly called by their popular name of brigadiers.</div><div class="sentence"> The guardians of the law shall propose as generals men who are natives of the city, and a selection from the candidates proposed shall be made by those who are or have been of the age for military service.</div><div class="sentence"> And if one who is not proposed is thought by somebody to be better than one who is, let him name whom he prefers in the place of whom, and make oath that he is better, and propose him; and whichever of them is approved by vote shall be admitted to the final selection; and the three who have the greatest number of votes shall be appointed generals, and superintendents of military affairs, after previously undergoing a scrutiny, like the guardians of the law.</div><div class="sentence"> And let the generals thus elected propose twelve brigadiers, one for each tribe; and there shall be a right of counter-proposal as in the case of the generals, and the voting and decision shall take place in the same way.</div><div class="sentence"> Until the prytanes and council are elected, the guardians of the law shall convene the assembly in some holy spot which is suitable to the purpose, placing the hoplites by themselves, and the cavalry by themselves, and in a third division all the rest of the army.</div><div class="sentence"> All are to vote for the generals (and for the colonels of horse), but the brigadiers are to be voted for only by those who carry shields (i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> the hoplites).</div><div class="sentence"> Let the body of cavalry choose phylarchs for the generals; but captains of light troops, or archers, or any other division of the army, shall be appointed by the generals for themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> There only remains the appointment of officers of cavalry: these shall be proposed by the same persons who proposed the generals, and the election and the counter-proposal of other candidates shall be arranged in the same way as in the case of the generals, and let the cavalry vote and the infantry look on at the election; the two who have the greatest number of votes shall be the leaders of all the horse.</div><div class="sentence"> Disputes about the voting may be raised once or twice; but if the dispute be raised a third time, the officers who preside at the several elections shall decide.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  We will say to them—O friends and saviours of our laws, in laying down any law, there are many particulars which we shall omit, and this cannot be helped; at the same time, we will do our utmost to describe what is important, and will give an outline which you shall fill up.</div><div class="sentence"> And I will explain on what principle you are to act.</div><div class="sentence"> Megillus and Cleinias and I have often spoken to one another touching these matters, and we are of opinion that we have spoken well.</div><div class="sentence"> And we hope that you will be of the same mind with us, and become our disciples, and keep in view the things which in our united opinion the legislator and guardian of the law ought to keep in view.</div><div class="sentence"> There was one main point about which we were agreed—that a man's whole energies throughout life should be devoted to the acquisition of the virtue proper to a man, whether this was to be gained by study, or habit, or some mode of acquisition, or desire, or opinion, or knowledge—and this applies equally to men and women, old and young—the aim of all should always be such as I have described; anything which may be an impediment, the good man ought to show that he utterly disregards.</div><div class="sentence"> And if at last necessity plainly compels him to be an outlaw from his native land, rather than bow his neck to the yoke of slavery and be ruled by inferiors, and he has to fly, an exile he must be and endure all such trials, rather than accept another form of government, which is likely to make men worse.</div><div class="sentence"> These are our original principles; and do you now, fixing your eyes upon the standard of what a man and a citizen ought or ought not to be, praise and blame the laws—blame those which have not this power of making the citizen better, but embrace those which have; and with gladness receive and live in them; bidding a long farewell to other institutions which aim at goods, as they are termed, of a different kind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span> <div class="sentence">  Let us proceed to another class of laws, beginning with their foundation in religion.</div><div class="sentence"> And we must first return to the number 5040—the entire number had, and has, a great many convenient divisions, and the number of the tribes which was a twelfth part of the whole, being correctly formed by 21 x 20 (5040/(21 x 20), i.e., 5040/420 = 12), also has them.</div><div class="sentence"> And not only is the whole number divisible by twelve, but also the number of each tribe is divisible by twelve.</div><div class="sentence"> Now every portion should be regarded by us as a sacred gift of Heaven, corresponding to the months and to the revolution of the universe (compare Tim.).</div><div class="sentence"> Every city has a guiding and sacred principle given by nature, but in some the division or distribution has been more right than in others, and has been more sacred and fortunate.</div><div class="sentence"> In our opinion, nothing can be more right than the selection of the number 5040, which may be divided by all numbers from one to twelve with the single exception of eleven, and that admits of a very easy correction; for if, turning to the dividend (5040), we deduct two families, the defect in the division is cured.</div><div class="sentence"> And the truth of this may be easily proved when we have leisure.</div><div class="sentence"> But for the present, trusting to the mere assertion of this principle, let us divide the state; and assigning to each portion some God or son of a God, let us give them altars and sacred rites, and at the altars let us hold assemblies for sacrifice twice in the month—twelve assemblies for the tribes, and twelve for the city, according to their divisions; the first in honour of the Gods and divine things, and the second to promote friendship and 'better acquaintance,' as the phrase is, and every sort of good fellowship with one another.</div><div class="sentence"> For people must be acquainted with those into whose families and whom they marry and with those to whom they give in marriage; in such matters, as far as possible, a man should deem it all important to avoid a mistake, and with this serious purpose let games be instituted (compare Republic) in which youths and maidens shall dance together, seeing one another and being seen naked, at a proper age, and on a suitable occasion, not transgressing the rules of modesty.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span> <div class="sentence">  The directors of choruses will be the superintendents and regulators of these games, and they, together with the guardians of the law, will legislate in any matters which we have omitted; for, as we said, where there are numerous and minute details, the legislator must leave out something.</div><div class="sentence"> And the annual officers who have experience, and know what is wanted, must make arrangements and improvements year by year, until such enactments and provisions are sufficiently determined.</div><div class="sentence"> A ten years' experience of sacrifices and dances, if extending to all particulars, will be quite sufficient; and if the legislator be alive they shall communicate with him, but if he be dead then the several officers shall refer the omissions which come under their notice to the guardians of the law, and correct them, until all is perfect; and from that time there shall be no more change, and they shall establish and use the new laws with the others which the legislator originally gave them, and of which they are never, if they can help, to change aught; or, if some necessity overtakes them, the magistrates must be called into counsel, and the whole people, and they must go to all the oracles of the Gods; and if they are all agreed, in that case they may make the change, but if they are not agreed, by no manner of means, and any one who dissents shall prevail, as the law ordains.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span> <div class="sentence">  Whenever any one over twenty-five years of age, having seen and been seen by others, believes himself to have found a marriage connexion which is to his mind, and suitable for the procreation of children, let him marry if he be still under the age of five-and-thirty years; but let him first hear how he ought to seek after what is suitable and appropriate (compare Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Pol.).</div><div class="sentence"> For, as Cleinias says, every law should have a suitable prelude.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span> <div class="sentence">  Let this then be our exhortation concerning marriage, and let us remember what was said before—that a man should cling to immortality, and leave behind him children's children to be the servants of God in his place for ever.</div><div class="sentence"> All this and much more may be truly said by way of prelude about the duty of marriage.</div><div class="sentence"> But if a man will not listen, and remains unsocial and alien among his fellow-citizens, and is still unmarried at thirty-five years of age, let him pay a yearly fine;—he who of the highest class shall pay a fine of a hundred drachmae, and he who is of the second class a fine of seventy drachmae; the third class shall pay sixty drachmae, and the fourth thirty drachmae, and let the money be sacred to Here; he who does not pay the fine annually shall owe ten times the sum, which the treasurer of the goddess shall exact; and if he fails in doing so, let him be answerable and give an account of the money at his audit.</div><div class="sentence"> He who refuses to marry shall be thus punished in money, and also be deprived of all honour which the younger show to the elder; let no young man voluntarily obey him, and, if he attempt to punish any one, let every one come to the rescue and defend the injured person, and he who is present and does not come to the rescue, shall be pronounced by the law to be a coward and a bad citizen.</div><div class="sentence"> Of the marriage portion I have already spoken; and again I say for the instruction of poor men that he who neither gives nor receives a dowry on account of poverty, has a compensation; for the citizens of our state are provided with the necessaries of life, and wives will be less likely to be insolent, and husbands to be mean and subservient to them on account of property.</div><div class="sentence"> And he who obeys this law will do a noble action; but he who will not obey, and gives or receives more than fifty drachmae as the price of the marriage garments if he be of the lowest, or more than a mina, or a mina-and-a-half, if he be of the third or second classes, or two minae if he be of the highest class, shall owe to the public treasury a similar sum, and that which is given or received shall be sacred to Here and Zeus; and let the treasurers of these Gods exact the money, as was said before about the unmarried—that the treasurers of Here were to exact the money, or pay the fine themselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">074</span> <div class="sentence">  The betrothal by a father shall be valid in the first degree, that by a grandfather in the second degree, and in the third degree, betrothal by brothers who have the same father; but if there are none of these alive, the betrothal by a mother shall be valid in like manner; in cases of unexampled fatality, the next of kin and the guardians shall have authority.</div><div class="sentence"> What are to be the rites before marriages, or any other sacred acts, relating either to future, present, or past marriages, shall be referred to the interpreters; and he who follows their advice may be satisfied.</div><div class="sentence"> Touching the marriage festival, they shall assemble not more than five male and five female friends of both families; and a like number of members of the family of either sex, and no man shall spend more than his means will allow; he who is of the richest class may spend a mina,—he who is of the second, half a mina, and in the same proportion as the census of each decreases: all men shall praise him who is obedient to the law; but he who is disobedient shall be punished by the guardians of the law as a man wanting in true taste, and uninstructed in the laws of bridal song.</div><div class="sentence"> Drunkenness is always improper, except at the festivals of the God who gave wine; and peculiarly dangerous, when a man is engaged in the business of marriage; at such a crisis of their lives a bride and bridegroom ought to have all their wits about them—they ought to take care that their offspring may be born of reasonable beings; for on what day or night Heaven will give them increase, who can say?</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover, they ought not to begetting children when their bodies are dissipated by intoxication, but their offspring should be compact and solid, quiet and compounded properly; whereas the drunkard is all abroad in all his actions, and beside himself both in body and soul.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore, also, the drunken man is bad and unsteady in sowing the seed of increase, and is likely to beget offspring who will be unstable and untrustworthy, and cannot be expected to walk straight either in body or mind.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence during the whole year and all his life long, and especially while he is begetting children, he ought to take care and not intentionally do what is injurious to health, or what involves insolence and wrong; for he cannot help leaving the impression of himself on the souls and bodies of his offspring, and he begets children in every way inferior.</div><div class="sentence"> And especially on the day and night of marriage should a man abstain from such things.</div><div class="sentence"> For the beginning, which is also a God dwelling in man, preserves all things, if it meet with proper respect from each individual.</div><div class="sentence"> He who marries is further to consider, that one of the two houses in the lot is the nest and nursery of his young, and there he is to marry and make a home for himself and bring up his children, going away from his father and mother.</div><div class="sentence"> For in friendships there must be some degree of desire, in order to cement and bind together diversities of character; but excessive intercourse not having the desire which is created by time, insensibly dissolves friendships from a feeling of satiety; wherefore a man and his wife shall leave to his and her father and mother their own dwelling-places, and themselves go as to a colony and dwell there, and visit and be visited by their parents; and they shall beget and bring up children, handing on the torch of life from one generation to another, and worshipping the Gods according to law for ever.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I am not surprised, Megillus, for the state of the Helots among the Lacedaemonians is of all Hellenic forms of slavery the most controverted and disputed about, some approving and some condemning it; there is less dispute about the slavery which exists among the Heracleots, who have subjugated the Mariandynians, and about the Thessalian Penestae.</div><div class="sentence"> Looking at these and the like examples, what ought we to do concerning property in slaves?</div><div class="sentence"> I made a remark, in passing, which naturally elicited a question about my meaning from you.</div><div class="sentence"> It was this: —We know that all would agree that we should have the best and most attached slaves whom we can get.</div><div class="sentence"> For many a man has found his slaves better in every way than brethren or sons, and many times they have saved the lives and property of their masters and their whole house—such tales are well known.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The reason is, that masters and freemen in states, when they hear of it, are very likely to arrive at a true conviction that without due regulation of private life in cities, stability in the laying down of laws is hardly to be expected (compare Republic); and he who makes this reflection may himself adopt the laws just now mentioned, and, adopting them, may order his house and state well and be happy.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The affection both of the Bacchantes and of the children is an emotion of fear, which springs out of an evil habit of the soul.</div><div class="sentence"> And when some one applies external agitation to affections of this sort, the motion coming from without gets the better of the terrible and violent internal one, and produces a peace and calm in the soul, and quiets the restless palpitation of the heart, which is a thing much to be desired, sending the children to sleep, and making the Bacchantes, although they remain awake, to dance to the pipe with the help of the Gods to whom they offer acceptable sacrifices, and producing in them a sound mind, which takes the place of their frenzy.</div><div class="sentence"> And, to express what I mean in a word, there is a good deal to be said in favour of this treatment.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The point about which you and I differ is of great importance, and I hope that you, Megillus, will help to decide between us.</div><div class="sentence"> For I maintain that the true life should neither seek for pleasures, nor, on the other hand, entirely avoid pains, but should embrace the middle state (compare Republic), which I just spoke of as gentle and benign, and is a state which we by some divine presage and inspiration rightly ascribe to God.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, I say, he among men, too, who would be divine ought to pursue after this mean habit—he should not rush headlong into pleasures, for he will not be free from pains; nor should we allow any one, young or old, male or female, to be thus given any more than ourselves, and least of all the newly-born infant, for in infancy more than at any other time the character is engrained by habit.</div><div class="sentence"> Nay, more, if I were not afraid of appearing to be ridiculous, I would say that a woman during her year of pregnancy should of all women be most carefully tended, and kept from violent or excessive pleasures and pains, and should at that time cultivate gentleness and benevolence and kindness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  You need not ask Megillus, Stranger, which of us has most truly spoken; for I myself agree that all men ought to avoid the life of unmingled pain or pleasure, and pursue always a middle course.</div><div class="sentence"> And having spoken well, may I add that you have been well answered?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Very good, Cleinias; and now let us all three consider a further point.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  That all the matters which we are now describing are commonly called by the general name of unwritten customs, and what are termed the laws of our ancestors are all of similar nature.</div><div class="sentence"> And the reflection which lately arose in our minds, that we can neither call these things laws, nor yet leave them unmentioned, is justified; for they are the bonds of the whole state, and come in between the written laws which are or are hereafter to be laid down; they are just ancestral customs of great antiquity, which, if they are rightly ordered and made habitual, shield and preserve the previously existing written law; but if they depart from right and fall into disorder, then they are like the props of builders which slip away out of their place and cause a universal ruin—one part drags another down, and the fair super-structure falls because the old foundations are undermined.</div><div class="sentence"> Reflecting upon this, Cleinias, you ought to bind together the new state in every possible way, omitting nothing, whether great or small, of what are called laws or manners or pursuits, for by these means a city is bound together, and all these things are only lasting when they depend upon one another; and, therefore, we must not wonder if we find that many apparently trifling customs or usages come pouring in and lengthening out our laws.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true:  we are disposed to agree with you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Up to the age of three years, whether of boy or girl, if a person strictly carries out our previous regulations and makes them a principal aim, he will do much for the advantage of the young creatures.</div><div class="sentence"> But at three, four, five, and even six years the childish nature will require sports; now is the time to get rid of self-will in him, punishing him, but not so as to disgrace him.</div><div class="sentence"> We were saying about slaves, that we ought neither to add insult to punishment so as to anger them, nor yet to leave them unpunished lest they become self-willed; and a like rule is to be observed in the case of the free-born.</div><div class="sentence"> Children at that age have certain natural modes of amusement which they find out for themselves when they meet.</div><div class="sentence"> And all the children who are between the ages of three and six ought to meet at the temples of the villages, the several families of a village uniting on one spot.</div><div class="sentence"> The nurses are to see that the children behave properly and orderly—they themselves and all their companies are to be under the control of twelve matrons, one for each company, who are annually selected to inspect them from the women previously mentioned [i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> the women who have authority over marriage], whom the guardians of the law appoint.</div><div class="sentence"> These matrons shall be chosen by the women who have authority over marriage, one out of each tribe; all are to be of the same age; and let each of them, as soon as she is appointed, hold office and go to the temples every day, punishing all offenders, male or female, who are slaves or strangers, by the help of some of the public slaves; but if any citizen disputes the punishment, let her bring him before the wardens of the city; or, if there be no dispute, let her punish him herself.</div><div class="sentence"> After the age of six years the time has arrived for the separation of the sexes—let boys live with boys, and girls in like manner with girls.</div><div class="sentence"> Now they must begin to learn—the boys going to teachers of horsemanship and the use of the bow, the javelin, and sling, and the girls too, if they do not object, at any rate until they know how to manage these weapons, and especially how to handle heavy arms; for I may note, that the practice which now prevails is almost universally misunderstood.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  In what respect?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  In that the right and left hand are supposed to be by nature differently suited for our various uses of them; whereas no difference is found in the use of the feet and the lower limbs; but in the use of the hands we are, as it were, maimed by the folly of nurses and mothers; for although our several limbs are by nature balanced, we create a difference in them by bad habit.</div><div class="sentence"> In some cases this is of no consequence, as, for example, when we hold the lyre in the left hand, and the plectrum in the right, but it is downright folly to make the same distinction in other cases.</div><div class="sentence"> The custom of the Scythians proves our error; for they not only hold the bow from them with the left hand and draw the arrow to them with their right, but use either hand for both purposes.</div><div class="sentence"> And there are many similar examples in charioteering and other things, from which we may learn that those who make the left side weaker than the right act contrary to nature.</div><div class="sentence"> In the case of the plectrum, which is of horn only, and similar instruments, as I was saying, it is of no consequence, but makes a great difference, and may be of very great importance to the warrior who has to use iron weapons, bows and javelins, and the like; above all, when in heavy armour, he has to fight against heavy armour.</div><div class="sentence"> And there is a very great difference between one who has learnt and one who has not, and between one who has been trained in gymnastic exercises and one who has not been.</div><div class="sentence"> For as he who is perfectly skilled in the Pancratium or boxing or wrestling, is not unable to fight from his left side, and does not limp and draggle in confusion when his opponent makes him change his position, so in heavy-armed fighting, and in all other things, if I am not mistaken, the like holds—he who has these double powers of attack and defence ought not in any case to leave them either unused or untrained, if he can help; and if a person had the nature of Geryon or Briareus he ought to be able with his hundred hands to throw a hundred darts.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, the magistrates, male and female, should see to all these things, the women superintending the nursing and amusements of the children, and the men superintending their education, that all of them, boys and girls alike, may be sound hand and foot, and may not, if they can help, spoil the gifts of nature by bad habits.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span> <div class="sentence">  Education has two branches—one of gymnastic, which is concerned with the body, and the other of music, which is designed for the improvement of the soul.</div><div class="sentence"> And gymnastic has also two branches—dancing and wrestling; and one sort of dancing imitates musical recitation, and aims at preserving dignity and freedom, the other aims at producing health, agility, and beauty in the limbs and parts of the body, giving the proper flexion and extension to each of them, a harmonious motion being diffused everywhere, and forming a suitable accompaniment to the dance.</div><div class="sentence"> As regards wrestling, the tricks which Antaeus and Cercyon devised in their systems out of a vain spirit of competition, or the tricks of boxing which Epeius or Amycus invented, are useless and unsuitable for war, and do not deserve to have much said about them; but the art of wrestling erect and keeping free the neck and hands and sides, working with energy and constancy, with a composed strength, for the sake of health—these are always useful, and are not to be neglected, but to be enjoined alike on masters and scholars, when we reach that part of legislation; and we will desire the one to give their instructions freely, and the others to receive them thankfully.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor, again, must we omit suitable imitations of war in our choruses; here in Crete you have the armed dances of the Curetes, and the Lacedaemonians have those of the Dioscuri.</div><div class="sentence"> And our virgin lady, delighting in the amusement of the dance, thought it not fit to amuse herself with empty hands; she must be clothed in a complete suit of armour, and in this attire go through the dance; and youths and maidens should in every respect imitate her, esteeming highly the favour of the Goddess, both with a view to the necessities of war, and to festive occasions: it will be right also for the boys, until such time as they go out to war, to make processions and supplications to all the Gods in goodly array, armed and on horseback, in dances and marches, fast or slow, offering up prayers to the Gods and to the sons of Gods; and also engaging in contests and preludes of contests, if at all, with these objects.</div><div class="sentence"> For these sorts of exercises, and no others, are useful both in peace and war, and are beneficial alike to states and to private houses.</div><div class="sentence"> But other labours and sports and exercises of the body are unworthy of freemen, O Megillus and Cleinias.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span> <div class="sentence">  I have now completely described the kind of gymnastic which I said at first ought to be described; if you know of any better, will you communicate your thoughts?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  It is not easy, Stranger, to put aside these principles of gymnastic and wrestling and to enunciate better ones.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Now we must say what has yet to be said about the gifts of the Muses and of Apollo:  before, we fancied that we had said all, and that gymnastic alone remained; but now we see clearly what points have been omitted, and should be first proclaimed; of these, then, let us proceed to speak.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let me tell you once more—although you have heard me say the same before—that caution must be always exercised, both by the speaker and by the hearer, about anything that is very singular and unusual.</div><div class="sentence"> For my tale is one which many a man would be afraid to tell, and yet I have a confidence which makes me go on.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What have you to say, Stranger?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I say that in states generally no one has observed that the plays of childhood have a great deal to do with the permanence or want of permanence in legislation.</div><div class="sentence"> For when plays are ordered with a view to children having the same plays, and amusing themselves after the same manner, and finding delight in the same playthings, the more solemn institutions of the state are allowed to remain undisturbed.</div><div class="sentence"> Whereas if sports are disturbed, and innovations are made in them, and they constantly change, and the young never speak of their having the same likings, or the same established notions of good and bad taste, either in the bearing of their bodies or in their dress, but he who devises something new and out of the way in figures and colours and the like is held in special honour, we may truly say that no greater evil can happen in a state; for he who changes the sports is secretly changing the manners of the young, and making the old to be dishonoured among them and the new to be honoured.</div><div class="sentence"> And I affirm that there is nothing which is a greater injury to all states than saying or thinking thus.</div><div class="sentence"> Will you hear me tell how great I deem the evil to be?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  You mean the evil of blaming antiquity in states?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  If you are speaking of that, you will find in us hearers who are disposed to receive what you say not unfavourably but most favourably.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I should expect so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">074</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Proceed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, let us give all the greater heed to one another's words.</div><div class="sentence"> The argument affirms that any change whatever except from evil is the most dangerous of all things; this is true in the case of the seasons and of the winds, in the management of our bodies and the habits of our minds—true of all things except, as I said before, of the bad.</div><div class="sentence"> He who looks at the constitution of individuals accustomed to eat any sort of meat, or drink any drink, or to do any work which they can get, may see that they are at first disordered by them, but afterwards, as time goes on, their bodies grow adapted to them, and they learn to know and like variety, and have good health and enjoyment of life; and if ever afterwards they are confined again to a superior diet, at first they are troubled with disorders, and with difficulty become habituated to their new food.</div><div class="sentence"> A similar principle we may imagine to hold good about the minds of men and the natures of their souls.</div><div class="sentence"> For when they have been brought up in certain laws, which by some Divine Providence have remained unchanged during long ages, so that no one has any memory or tradition of their ever having been otherwise than they are, then every one is afraid and ashamed to change that which is established.</div><div class="sentence"> The legislator must somehow find a way of implanting this reverence for antiquity, and I would propose the following way:  People are apt to fancy, as I was saying before, that when the plays of children are altered they are merely plays, not seeing that the most serious and detrimental consequences arise out of the change; and they readily comply with the child's wishes instead of deterring him, not considering that these children who make innovations in their games, when they grow up to be men, will be different from the last generation of children, and, being different, will desire a different sort of life, and under the influence of this desire will want other institutions and laws; and no one of them reflects that there will follow what I just now called the greatest of evils to states.</div><div class="sentence"> Changes in bodily fashions are no such serious evils, but frequent changes in the praise and censure of manners are the greatest of evils, and require the utmost prevision.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">076</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And now do we still hold to our former assertion, that rhythms and music in general are imitations of good and evil characters in men?</div><div class="sentence"> What say you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">078</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That is the only doctrine which we can admit.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">079</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Must we not, then, try in every possible way to prevent our youth from even desiring to imitate new modes either in dance or song?</div><div class="sentence"> nor must any one be allowed to offer them varieties of pleasures.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">081</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Can any of us imagine a better mode of effecting this object than that of the Egyptians?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">082</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What is their method?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">083</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  To consecrate every sort of dance or melody.</div><div class="sentence"> First we should ordain festivals—calculating for the year what they ought to be, and at what time, and in honour of what Gods, sons of Gods, and heroes they ought to be celebrated; and, in the next place, what hymns ought to be sung at the several sacrifices, and with what dances the particular festival is to be honoured.</div><div class="sentence"> This has to be arranged at first by certain persons, and, when arranged, the whole assembly of the citizens are to offer sacrifices and libations to the Fates and all the other Gods, and to consecrate the several odes to Gods and heroes:  and if any one offers any other hymns or dances to any one of the Gods, the priests and priestesses, acting in concert with the guardians of the law, shall, with the sanction of religion and the law, exclude him, and he who is excluded, if he do not submit, shall be liable all his life long to have a suit of impiety brought against him by any one who likes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">084</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">085</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  In the consideration of this subject, let us remember what is due to ourselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">086</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  To what are you referring?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I mean that any young man, and much more any old one, when he sees or hears anything strange or unaccustomed, does not at once run to embrace the paradox, but he stands considering, like a person who is at a place where three paths meet, and does not very well know his way—he may be alone or he may be walking with others, and he will say to himself and them, 'Which is the way?'</div><div class="sentence"> and will not move forward until he is satisfied that he is going right.</div><div class="sentence"> And this is what we must do in the present instance:  A strange discussion on the subject of law has arisen, which requires the utmost consideration, and we should not at our age be too ready to speak about such great matters, or be confident that we can say anything certain all in a moment.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">088</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then we will allow time for reflection, and decide when we have given the subject sufficient consideration.</div><div class="sentence"> But that we may not be hindered from completing the natural arrangement of our laws, let us proceed to the conclusion of them in due order; for very possibly, if God will, the exposition of them, when completed, may throw light on our present perplexity.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Excellent, Stranger; let us do as you propose.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us then affirm the paradox that strains of music are our laws (nomoi), and this latter being the name which the ancients gave to lyric songs, they probably would not have very much objected to our proposed application of the word.</div><div class="sentence"> Some one, either asleep or awake, must have had a dreamy suspicion of their nature.</div><div class="sentence"> And let our decree be as follows:  No one in singing or dancing shall offend against public and consecrated models, and the general fashion among the youth, any more than he would offend against any other law.</div><div class="sentence"> And he who observes this law shall be blameless; but he who is disobedient, as I was saying, shall be punished by the guardians of the laws, and by the priests and priestesses.</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose that we imagine this to be our law.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">093</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Can any one who makes such laws escape ridicule?</div><div class="sentence"> Let us see.</div><div class="sentence"> I think that our only safety will be in first framing certain models for composers.</div><div class="sentence"> One of these models shall be as follows:  If when a sacrifice is going on, and the victims are being burnt according to law—if, I say, any one who may be a son or brother, standing by another at the altar and over the victims, horribly blasphemes, will not his words inspire despondency and evil omens and forebodings in the mind of his father and of his other kinsmen?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And this is just what takes place in almost all our cities.</div><div class="sentence"> A magistrate offers a public sacrifice, and there come in not one but many choruses, who take up a position a little way from the altar, and from time to time pour forth all sorts of horrible blasphemies on the sacred rites, exciting the souls of the audience with words and rhythms and melodies most sorrowful to hear; and he who at the moment when the city is offering sacrifice makes the citizens weep most, carries away the palm of victory.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, ought we not to forbid such strains as these?</div><div class="sentence"> And if ever our citizens must hear such lamentations, then on some unblest and inauspicious day let there be choruses of foreign and hired minstrels, like those hirelings who accompany the departed at funerals with barbarous Carian chants.</div><div class="sentence"> That is the sort of thing which will be appropriate if we have such strains at all; and let the apparel of the singers be, not circlets and ornaments of gold, but the reverse.</div><div class="sentence"> Enough of all this.</div><div class="sentence"> I will simply ask once more whether we shall lay down as one of our principles of song—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  That we should avoid every word of evil omen; let that kind of song which is of good omen be heard everywhere and always in our state.</div><div class="sentence"> I need hardly ask again, but shall assume that you agree with me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">098</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  By all means; that law is approved by the suffrages of us all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But what shall be our next musical law or type?</div><div class="sentence"> Ought not prayers to be offered up to the Gods when we sacrifice?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">100</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And our third law, if I am not mistaken, will be to the effect that our poets, understanding prayers to be requests which we make to the Gods, will take especial heed that they do not by mistake ask for evil instead of good.</div><div class="sentence"> To make such a prayer would surely be too ridiculous.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">103</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Were we not a little while ago quite convinced that no silver or golden Plutus should dwell in our state?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And what has it been the object of our argument to show?</div><div class="sentence"> Did we not imply that the poets are not always quite capable of knowing what is good or evil?</div><div class="sentence"> And if one of them utters a mistaken prayer in song or words, he will make our citizens pray for the opposite of what is good in matters of the highest import; than which, as I was saying, there can be few greater mistakes.</div><div class="sentence"> Shall we then propose as one of our laws and models relating to the Muses—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div><div class="sentence"> will you explain the law more precisely?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Shall we make a law that the poet shall compose nothing contrary to the ideas of the lawful, or just, or beautiful, or good, which are allowed in the state?</div><div class="sentence"> nor shall he be permitted to communicate his compositions to any private individuals, until he shall have shown them to the appointed judges and the guardians of the law, and they are satisfied with them.</div><div class="sentence"> As to the persons whom we appoint to be our legislators about music and as to the director of education, these have been already indicated.</div><div class="sentence"> Once more then, as I have asked more than once, shall this be our third law, and type, and model—What do you say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Let it be so, by all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">109</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then it will be proper to have hymns and praises of the Gods, intermingled with prayers; and after the Gods prayers and praises should be offered in like manner to demigods and heroes, suitable to their several characters.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">111</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  In the next place there will be no objection to a law, that citizens who are departed and have done good and energetic deeds, either with their souls or with their bodies, and have been obedient to the laws, should receive eulogies; this will be very fitting.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">137</span> <div class="sentence">  But how can our law sufficiently train the director of education himself; for as yet all has been imperfect, and nothing has been said either clear or satisfactory?</div><div class="sentence"> Now, as far as possible, the law ought to leave nothing to him, but to explain everything, that he may be an interpreter and tutor to others.</div><div class="sentence"> About dances and music and choral strains, I have already spoken both as to the character of the selection of them, and the manner in which they are to be amended and consecrated.</div><div class="sentence"> But we have not as yet spoken, O illustrious guardian of education, of the manner in which your pupils are to use those strains which are written in prose, although you have been informed what martial strains they are to learn and practise; what relates in the first place to the learning of letters, and secondly, to the lyre, and also to calculation, which, as we were saying, is needful for them all to learn, and any other things which are required with a view to war and the management of house and city, and, looking to the same object, what is useful in the revolutions of the heavenly bodies—the stars and sun and moon, and the various regulations about these matters which are necessary for the whole state—I am speaking of the arrangements of days in periods of months, and of months in years, which are to be observed, in order that seasons and sacrifices and festivals may have their regular and natural order, and keep the city alive and awake, the Gods receiving the honours due to them, and men having a better understanding about them: all these things, O my friend, have not yet been sufficiently declared to you by the legislator.</div><div class="sentence"> Attend, then, to what I am now going to say: We were telling you, in the first place, that you were not sufficiently informed about letters, and the objection was to this effect—that you were never told whether he who was meant to be a respectable citizen should apply himself in detail to that sort of learning, or not apply himself at all; and the same remark holds good of the study of the lyre.</div><div class="sentence"> But now we say that he ought to attend to them.</div><div class="sentence"> A fair time for a boy of ten years old to spend in letters is three years; the age of thirteen is the proper time for him to begin to handle the lyre, and he may continue at this for another three years, neither more nor less, and whether his father or himself like or dislike the study, he is not to be allowed to spend more or less time in learning music than the law allows.</div><div class="sentence"> And let him who disobeys the law be deprived of those youthful honours of which we shall hereafter speak.</div><div class="sentence"> Hear, however, first of all, what the young ought to learn in the early years of life, and what their instructors ought to teach them.</div><div class="sentence"> They ought to be occupied with their letters until they are able to read and write; but the acquisition of perfect beauty or quickness in writing, if nature has not stimulated them to acquire these accomplishments in the given number of years, they should let alone.</div><div class="sentence"> And as to the learning of compositions committed to writing which are not set to the lyre, whether metrical or without rhythmical divisions, compositions in prose, as they are termed, having no rhythm or harmony—seeing how dangerous are the writings handed down to us by many writers of this class—what will you do with them, O most excellent guardians of the law?</div><div class="sentence"> or how can the lawgiver rightly direct you about them?</div><div class="sentence"> I believe that he will be in great difficulty.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">138</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What troubles you, Stranger?</div><div class="sentence"> and why are you so perplexed in your mind?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">153</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I think that I am not wholly in want of a pattern, for when I consider the words which we have spoken from early dawn until now, and which, as I believe, have been inspired by Heaven, they appear to me to be quite like a poem.</div><div class="sentence"> When I reflected upon all these words of ours, I naturally felt pleasure, for of all the discourses which I have ever learnt or heard, either in poetry or prose, this seemed to me to be the justest, and most suitable for young men to hear; I cannot imagine any better pattern than this which the guardian of the law who is also the director of education can have.</div><div class="sentence"> He cannot do better than advise the teachers to teach the young these words and any which are of a like nature, if he should happen to find them, either in poetry or prose, or if he come across unwritten discourses akin to ours, he should certainly preserve them, and commit them to writing.</div><div class="sentence"> And, first of all, he shall constrain the teachers themselves to learn and approve them, and any of them who will not, shall not be employed by him, but those whom he finds agreeing in his judgment, he shall make use of and shall commit to them the instruction and education of youth.</div><div class="sentence"> And here and on this wise let my fanciful tale about letters and teachers of letters come to an end.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">176</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Excellent.</div><div class="sentence"> ATHENIAN:  Enough of wrestling; we will now proceed to speak of other movements of the body.</div><div class="sentence"> Such motion may be in general called dancing, and is of two kinds:  one of nobler figures, imitating the honourable, the other of the more ignoble figures, imitating the mean; and of both these there are two further subdivisions.</div><div class="sentence"> Of the serious, one kind is of those engaged in war and vehement action, and is the exercise of a noble person and a manly heart; the other exhibits a temperate soul in the enjoyment of prosperity and modest pleasures, and may be truly called and is the dance of peace.</div><div class="sentence"> The warrior dance is different from the peaceful one, and may be rightly termed Pyrrhic; this imitates the modes of avoiding blows and missiles by dropping or giving way, or springing aside, or rising up or falling down; also the opposite postures which are those of action, as, for example, the imitation of archery and the hurling of javelins, and of all sorts of blows.</div><div class="sentence"> And when the imitation is of brave bodies and souls, and the action is direct and muscular, giving for the most part a straight movement to the limbs of the body—that, I say, is the true sort; but the opposite is not right.</div><div class="sentence"> In the dance of peace what we have to consider is whether a man bears himself naturally and gracefully, and after the manner of men who duly conform to the law.</div><div class="sentence"> But before proceeding I must distinguish the dancing about which there is any doubt, from that about which there is no doubt.</div><div class="sentence"> Which is the doubtful kind, and how are the two to be distinguished?</div><div class="sentence"> There are dances of the Bacchic sort, both those in which, as they say, they imitate drunken men, and which are named after the Nymphs, and Pan, and Silenuses, and Satyrs; and also those in which purifications are made or mysteries celebrated—all this sort of dancing cannot be rightly defined as having either a peaceful or a warlike character, or indeed as having any meaning whatever, and may, I think, be most truly described as distinct from the warlike dance, and distinct from the peaceful, and not suited for a city at all.</div><div class="sentence"> There let it lie; and so leaving it to lie, we will proceed to the dances of war and peace, for with these we are undoubtedly concerned.</div><div class="sentence"> Now the unwarlike muse, which honours in dance the Gods and the sons of the Gods, is entirely associated with the consciousness of prosperity; this class may be subdivided into two lesser classes, of which one is expressive of an escape from some labour or danger into good, and has greater pleasures, the other expressive of preservation and increase of former good, in which the pleasure is less exciting—in all these cases, every man when the pleasure is greater, moves his body more, and less when the pleasure is less; and, again, if he be more orderly and has learned courage from discipline he moves less, but if he be a coward, and has no training or self-control, he makes greater and more violent movements, and in general when he is speaking or singing he is not altogether able to keep his body still; and so out of the imitation of words in gestures the whole art of dancing has arisen.</div><div class="sentence"> And in these various kinds of imitation one man moves in an orderly, another in a disorderly manner; and as the ancients may be observed to have given many names which are according to nature and deserving of praise, so there is an excellent one which they have given to the dances of men who in their times of prosperity are moderate in their pleasures—the giver of names, whoever he was, assigned to them a very true, and poetical, and rational name, when he called them Emmeleiai, or dances of order, thus establishing two kinds of dances of the nobler sort, the dance of war which he called the Pyrrhic, and the dance of peace which he called Emmeleia, or the dance of order; giving to each their appropriate and becoming name.</div><div class="sentence"> These things the legislator should indicate in general outline, and the guardian of the law should enquire into them and search them out, combining dancing with music, and assigning to the several sacrificial feasts that which is suitable to them; and when he has consecrated all of them in due order, he shall for the future change nothing, whether of dance or song.</div><div class="sentence"> Thenceforward the city and the citizens shall continue to have the same pleasures, themselves being as far as possible alike, and shall live well and happily.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">177</span> <div class="sentence">  I have described the dances which are appropriate to noble bodies and generous souls.</div><div class="sentence"> But it is necessary also to consider and know uncomely persons and thoughts, and those which are intended to produce laughter in comedy, and have a comic character in respect of style, song, and dance, and of the imitations which these afford.</div><div class="sentence"> For serious things cannot be understood without laughable things, nor opposites at all without opposites, if a man is really to have intelligence of either; but he cannot carry out both in action, if he is to have any degree of virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> And for this very reason he should learn them both, in order that he may not in ignorance do or say anything which is ridiculous and out of place—he should command slaves and hired strangers to imitate such things, but he should never take any serious interest in them himself, nor should any freeman or freewoman be discovered taking pains to learn them; and there should always be some element of novelty in the imitation.</div><div class="sentence"> Let these then be laid down, both in law and in our discourse, as the regulations of laughable amusements which are generally called comedy.</div><div class="sentence"> And, if any of the serious poets, as they are termed, who write tragedy, come to us and say—'O strangers, may we go to your city and country or may we not, and shall we bring with us our poetry—what is your will about these matters?</div><div class="sentence"> '—how shall we answer the divine men?</div><div class="sentence"> I think that our answer should be as follows: Best of strangers, we will say to them, we also according to our ability are tragic poets, and our tragedy is the best and noblest; for our whole state is an imitation of the best and noblest life, which we affirm to be indeed the very truth of tragedy.</div><div class="sentence"> You are poets and we are poets, both makers of the same strains, rivals and antagonists in the noblest of dramas, which true law can alone perfect, as our hope is.</div><div class="sentence"> Do not then suppose that we shall all in a moment allow you to erect your stage in the agora, or introduce the fair voices of your actors, speaking above our own, and permit you to harangue our women and children, and the common people, about our institutions, in language other than our own, and very often the opposite of our own.</div><div class="sentence"> For a state would be mad which gave you this licence, until the magistrates had determined whether your poetry might be recited, and was fit for publication or not.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore, O ye sons and scions of the softer Muses, first of all show your songs to the magistrates, and let them compare them with our own, and if they are the same or better we will give you a chorus; but if not, then, my friends, we cannot.</div><div class="sentence"> Let these, then, be the customs ordained by law about all dances and the teaching of them, and let matters relating to slaves be separated from those relating to masters, if you do not object.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">235</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  At all events, the Gods cannot like us to be spreading a false report of them.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">237</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And if we can show that such is really the fact, then all these matters ought to be learned so far as is necessary for the avoidance of impiety; but if we cannot, they may be let alone, and let this be our decision.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">238</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">239</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Enough of laws relating to education and learning.</div><div class="sentence"> But hunting and similar pursuits in like manner claim our attention.</div><div class="sentence"> For the legislator appears to have a duty imposed upon him which goes beyond mere legislation.</div><div class="sentence"> There is something over and above law which lies in a region between admonition and law, and has several times occurred to us in the course of discussion; for example, in the education of very young children there were things, as we maintain, which are not to be defined, and to regard them as matters of positive law is a great absurdity.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, our laws and the whole constitution of our state having been thus delineated, the praise of the virtuous citizen is not complete when he is described as the person who serves the laws best and obeys them most, but the higher form of praise is that which describes him as the good citizen who passes through life undefiled and is obedient to the words of the legislator, both when he is giving laws and when he assigns praise and blame.</div><div class="sentence"> This is the truest word that can be spoken in praise of a citizen; and the true legislator ought not only to write his laws, but also to interweave with them all such things as seem to him honourable and dishonourable.</div><div class="sentence"> And the perfect citizen ought to seek to strengthen these no less than the principles of law which are sanctioned by punishments.</div><div class="sentence"> I will adduce an example which will clear up my meaning, and will be a sort of witness to my words.</div><div class="sentence"> Hunting is of wide extent, and has a name under which many things are included, for there is a hunting of creatures in the water, and of creatures in the air, and there is a great deal of hunting of land animals of all kinds, and not of wild beasts only.</div><div class="sentence"> The hunting after man is also worthy of consideration; there is the hunting after him in war, and there is often a hunting after him in the way of friendship, which is praised and also blamed; and there is thieving, and the hunting which is practised by robbers, and that of armies against armies.</div><div class="sentence"> Now the legislator, in laying down laws about hunting, can neither abstain from noting these things, nor can he make threatening ordinances which will assign rules and penalties about all of them.</div><div class="sentence"> What is he to do?</div><div class="sentence"> He will have to praise and blame hunting with a view to the exercise and pursuits of youth.</div><div class="sentence"> And, on the other hand, the young man must listen obediently; neither pleasure nor pain should hinder him, and he should regard as his standard of action the praises and injunctions of the legislator rather than the punishments which he imposes by law.</div><div class="sentence"> This being premised, there will follow next in order moderate praise and censure of hunting; the praise being assigned to that kind which will make the souls of young men better, and the censure to that which has the opposite effect.</div><div class="sentence"> And now let us address young men in the form of a prayer for their welfare:  O friends, we will say to them, may no desire or love of hunting in the sea, or of angling or of catching the creatures in the waters, ever take possession of you, either when you are awake or when you are asleep, by hook or with weels, which latter is a very lazy contrivance; and let not any desire of catching men and of piracy by sea enter into your souls and make you cruel and lawless hunters.</div><div class="sentence"> And as to the desire of thieving in town or country, may it never enter into your most passing thoughts; nor let the insidious fancy of catching birds, which is hardly worthy of freemen, come into the head of any youth.</div><div class="sentence"> There remains therefore for our athletes only the hunting and catching of land animals, of which the one sort is called hunting by night, in which the hunters sleep in turn and are lazy; this is not to be commended any more than that which has intervals of rest, in which the wild strength of beasts is subdued by nets and snares, and not by the victory of a laborious spirit.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus, only the best kind of hunting is allowed at all—that of quadrupeds, which is carried on with horses and dogs and men's own persons, and they get the victory over the animals by running them down and striking them and hurling at them, those who have a care of godlike manhood taking them with their own hands.</div><div class="sentence"> The praise and blame which is assigned to all these things has now been declared; and let the law be as follows:  Let no one hinder these who verily are sacred hunters from following the chase wherever and whithersoever they will; but the hunter by night, who trusts to his nets and gins, shall not be allowed to hunt anywhere.</div><div class="sentence"> The fowler in the mountains and waste places shall be permitted, but on cultivated ground and on consecrated wilds he shall not be permitted; and any one who meets him may stop him.</div><div class="sentence"> As to the hunter in waters, he may hunt anywhere except in harbours or sacred streams or marshes or pools, provided only that he do not pollute the water with poisonous juices.</div><div class="sentence"> And now we may say that all our enactments about education are complete.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Next, with the help of the Delphian oracle, we have to institute festivals and make laws about them, and to determine what sacrifices will be for the good of the city, and to what Gods they shall be offered; but when they shall be offered, and how often, may be partly regulated by us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  The number—yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then we will first determine the number; and let the whole number be 365—one for every day—so that one magistrate at least will sacrifice daily to some God or demi-god on behalf of the city, and the citizens, and their possessions.</div><div class="sentence"> And the interpreters, and priests, and priestesses, and prophets shall meet, and, in company with the guardians of the law, ordain those things which the legislator of necessity omits; and I may remark that they are the very persons who ought to take note of what is omitted.</div><div class="sentence"> The law will say that there are twelve feasts dedicated to the twelve Gods, after whom the several tribes are named; and that to each of them they shall sacrifice every month, and appoint choruses, and musical and gymnastic contests, assigning them so as to suit the Gods and seasons of the year.</div><div class="sentence"> And they shall have festivals for women, distinguishing those which ought to be separated from the men's festivals, and those which ought not.</div><div class="sentence"> Further, they shall not confuse the infernal deities and their rites with the Gods who are termed heavenly and their rites, but shall separate them, giving to Pluto his own in the twelfth month, which is sacred to him, according to the law.</div><div class="sentence"> To such a deity warlike men should entertain no aversion, but they should honour him as being always the best friend of man.</div><div class="sentence"> For the connexion of soul and body is no way better than the dissolution of them, as I am ready to maintain quite seriously.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover, those who would regulate these matters rightly should consider, that our city among existing cities has no fellow, either in respect of leisure or command of the necessaries of life, and that like an individual she ought to live happily.</div><div class="sentence"> And those who would live happily should in the first place do no wrong to one another, and ought not themselves to be wronged by others; to attain the first is not difficult, but there is great difficulty in acquiring the power of not being wronged.</div><div class="sentence"> No man can be perfectly secure against wrong, unless he has become perfectly good; and cities are like individuals in this, for a city if good has a life of peace, but if evil, a life of war within and without.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore the citizens ought to practise war—not in time of war, but rather while they are at peace.</div><div class="sentence"> And every city which has any sense, should take the field at least for one day in every month, and for more if the magistrates think fit, having no regard to winter cold or summer heat; and they should go out en masse, including their wives and their children, when the magistrates determine to lead forth the whole people, or in separate portions when summoned by them; and they should always provide that there should be games and sacrificial feasts, and they should have tournaments, imitating in as lively a manner as they can real battles.</div><div class="sentence"> And they should distribute prizes of victory and valour to the competitors, passing censures and encomiums on one another according to the characters which they bear in the contests and in their whole life, honouring him who seems to be the best, and blaming him who is the opposite.</div><div class="sentence"> And let poets celebrate the victors—not however every poet, but only one who in the first place is not less than fifty years of age; nor should he be one who, although he may have musical and poetical gifts, has never in his life done any noble or illustrious action; but those who are themselves good and also honourable in the state, creators of noble actions—let their poems be sung, even though they be not very musical.</div><div class="sentence"> And let the judgment of them rest with the instructor of youth and the other guardians of the laws, who shall give them this privilege, and they alone shall be free to sing; but the rest of the world shall not have this liberty.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor shall any one dare to sing a song which has not been approved by the judgment of the guardians of the laws, not even if his strain be sweeter than the songs of Thamyras and Orpheus; but only such poems as have been judged sacred and dedicated to the Gods, and such as are the works of good men, in which praise or blame has been awarded and which have been deemed to fulfil their design fairly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  The regulations about war, and about liberty of speech in poetry, ought to apply equally to men and women.</div><div class="sentence"> The legislator may be supposed to argue the question in his own mind: Who are my citizens for whom I have set in order the city?</div><div class="sentence"> Are they not competitors in the greatest of all contests, and have they not innumerable rivals?</div><div class="sentence"> To be sure, will be the natural reply.</div><div class="sentence"> Well, but if we were training boxers, or pancratiasts, or any other sort of athletes, would they never meet until the hour of contest arrived; and should we do nothing to prepare ourselves previously by daily practice?</div><div class="sentence"> Surely, if we were boxers, we should have been learning to fight for many days before, and exercising ourselves in imitating all those blows and wards which we were intending to use in the hour of conflict; and in order that we might come as near to reality as possible, instead of cestuses we should put on boxing-gloves, that the blows and the wards might be practised by us to the utmost of our power.</div><div class="sentence"> And if there were a lack of competitors, the ridicule of fools would not deter us from hanging up a lifeless image and practising at that.</div><div class="sentence"> Or if we had no adversary at all, animate or inanimate, should we not venture in the dearth of antagonists to spar by ourselves?</div><div class="sentence"> In what other manner could we ever study the art of self-defence?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  The way which you mention, Stranger, would be the only way.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And shall the warriors of our city, who are destined when occasion calls to enter the greatest of all contests, and to fight for their lives, and their children, and their property, and the whole city, be worse prepared than boxers?</div><div class="sentence"> And will the legislator, because he is afraid that their practising with one another may appear to some ridiculous, abstain from commanding them to go out and fight; will he not ordain that soldiers shall perform lesser exercises without arms every day, making dancing and all gymnastic tend to this end; and also will he not require that they shall practise some gymnastic exercises, greater as well as lesser, as often as every month; and that they shall have contests one with another in every part of the country, seizing upon posts and lying in ambush, and imitating in every respect the reality of war; fighting with boxing-gloves and hurling javelins, and using weapons somewhat dangerous, and as nearly as possible like the true ones, in order that the sport may not be altogether without fear, but may have terrors and to a certain degree show the man who has and who has not courage; and that the honour and dishonour which are assigned to them respectively, may prepare the whole city for the true conflict of life?</div><div class="sentence"> If any one dies in these mimic contests, the homicide is involuntary, and we will make the slayer, when he has been purified according to law, to be pure of blood, considering that if a few men should die, others as good as they will be born; but that if fear is dead, then the citizens will never find a test of superior and inferior natures, which is a far greater evil to the state than the loss of a few.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  We are quite agreed, Stranger, that we should legislate about such things, and that the whole state should practise them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And what is the reason that dances and contests of this sort hardly ever exist in states, at least not to any extent worth speaking of?</div><div class="sentence"> Is this due to the ignorance of mankind and their legislators?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Perhaps.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not, sweet Cleinias; there are two causes, which are quite enough to account for the deficiency.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What are they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  One cause is the love of wealth, which wholly absorbs men, and never for a moment allows them to think of anything but their own private possessions; on this the soul of every citizen hangs suspended, and can attend to nothing but his daily gain; mankind are ready to learn any branch of knowledge, and to follow any pursuit which tends to this end, and they laugh at every other:  that is one reason why a city will not be in earnest about such contests or any other good and honourable pursuit.</div><div class="sentence"> But from an insatiable love of gold and silver, every man will stoop to any art or contrivance, seemly or unseemly, in the hope of becoming rich; and will make no objection to performing any action, holy, or unholy and utterly base; if only like a beast he have the power of eating and drinking all kinds of things, and procuring for himself in every sort of way the gratification of his lusts.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let this, then, be deemed one of the causes which prevent states from pursuing in an efficient manner the art of war, or any other noble aim, but makes the orderly and temperate part of mankind into merchants, and captains of ships, and servants, and converts the valiant sort into thieves and burglars, and robbers of temples, and violent, tyrannical persons; many of whom are not without ability, but they are unfortunate.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Must not they be truly unfortunate whose souls are compelled to pass through life always hungering?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Then that is one cause, Stranger; but you spoke of another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Thank you for reminding me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  The insatiable lifelong love of wealth, as you were saying, is one cause which absorbs mankind, and prevents them from rightly practising the arts of war:  Granted; and now tell me, what is the other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Do you imagine that I delay because I am in a perplexity?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  No; but we think that you are too severe upon the money-loving temper, of which you seem in the present discussion to have a peculiar dislike.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  That is a very fair rebuke, Cleinias; and I will now proceed to the second cause.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Proceed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I say that governments are a cause—democracy, oligarchy, tyranny, concerning which I have often spoken in the previous discourse; or rather governments they are not, for none of them exercises a voluntary rule over voluntary subjects; but they may be truly called states of discord, in which while the government is voluntary, the subjects always obey against their will, and have to be coerced; and the ruler fears the subject, and will not, if he can help, allow him to become either noble, or rich, or strong, or valiant, or warlike at all.</div><div class="sentence"> These two are the chief causes of almost all evils, and of the evils of which I have been speaking they are notably the causes.</div><div class="sentence"> But our state has escaped both of them; for her citizens have the greatest leisure, and they are not subject to one another, and will, I think, be made by these laws the reverse of lovers of money.</div><div class="sentence"> Such a constitution may be reasonably supposed to be the only one existing which will accept the education which we have described, and the martial pastimes which have been perfected according to our idea.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then next we must remember, about all gymnastic contests, that only the warlike sort of them are to be practised and to have prizes of victory; and those which are not military are to be given up.</div><div class="sentence"> The military sort had better be completely described and established by law; and first, let us speak of running and swiftness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly the most military of all qualities is general activity of body, whether of foot or hand.</div><div class="sentence"> For escaping or for capturing an enemy, quickness of foot is required; but hand-to-hand conflict and combat need vigour and strength.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then our herald, in accordance with the prevailing practice, will first summon the runner—he will appear armed, for to an unarmed competitor we will not give a prize.</div><div class="sentence"> And he shall enter first who is to run the single course bearing arms; next, he who is to run the double course; third, he who is to run the horse-course; and fourthly, he who is to run the long course; the fifth whom we start, shall be the first sent forth in heavy armour, and shall run a course of sixty stadia to some temple of Ares—and we will send forth another, whom we will style the more heavily armed, to run over smoother ground.</div><div class="sentence"> There remains the archer; and he shall run in the full equipments of an archer a distance of 100 stadia over mountains, and across every sort of country, to a temple of Apollo and Artemis; this shall be the order of the contest, and we will wait for them until they return, and will give a prize to the conqueror in each.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us suppose that there are three kinds of contests—one of boys, another of beardless youths, and a third of men.</div><div class="sentence"> For the youths we will fix the length of the contest at two-thirds, and for the boys at half of the entire course, whether they contend as archers or as heavy-armed.</div><div class="sentence"> Touching the women, let the girls who are not grown up compete naked in the stadium and the double course, and the horse-course and the long course, and let them run on the race-ground itself; those who are thirteen years of age and upwards until their marriage shall continue to share in contests if they are not more than twenty, and shall be compelled to run up to eighteen; and they shall descend into the arena in suitable dresses.</div><div class="sentence"> Let these be the regulations about contests in running both for men and women.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span> <div class="sentence">  Respecting contests of strength, instead of wrestling and similar contests of the heavier sort, we will institute conflicts in armour of one against one, and two against two, and so on up to ten against ten.</div><div class="sentence"> As to what a man ought not to suffer or do, and to what extent, in order to gain the victory—as in wrestling, the masters of the art have laid down what is fair and what is not fair, so in fighting in armour—we ought to call in skilful persons, who shall judge for us and be our assessors in the work of legislation; they shall say who deserves to be victor in combats of this sort, and what he is not to do or have done to him, and in like manner what rule determines who is defeated; and let these ordinances apply to women until they are married as well as to men.</div><div class="sentence"> The pancration shall have a counterpart in a combat of the light-armed; they shall contend with bows and with light shields and with javelins and in the throwing of stones by slings and by hand: and laws shall be made about it, and rewards and prizes given to him who best fulfils the ordinances of the law.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span> <div class="sentence">  Next in order we shall have to legislate about the horse contests.</div><div class="sentence"> Now we do not need many horses, for they cannot be of much use in a country like Crete, and hence we naturally do not take great pains about the rearing of them or about horse races.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no one who keeps a chariot among us, and any rivalry in such matters would be altogether out of place; there would be no sense nor any shadow of sense in instituting contests which are not after the manner of our country.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore we give our prizes for single horses—for colts who have not yet cast their teeth, and for those who are intermediate, and for the full-grown horses themselves; and thus our equestrian games will accord with the nature of the country.</div><div class="sentence"> Let them have conflict and rivalry in these matters in accordance with the law, and let the colonels and generals of horse decide together about all courses and about the armed competitors in them.</div><div class="sentence"> But we have nothing to say to the unarmed either in gymnastic exercises or in these contests.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, the Cretan bowman or javelin-man who fights in armour on horseback is useful, and therefore we may as well place a competition of this sort among our amusements.</div><div class="sentence"> Women are not to be forced to compete by laws and ordinances; but if from previous training they have acquired the habit and are strong enough and like to take part, let them do so, girls as well as boys, and no blame to them.</div></div>

for example, husbandmen have had of old excellent laws about waters, and there is no reason why we should propose to divert their course: He who likes may draw water from the fountain-head of the common stream on to his own land, if he do not cut off the spring which clearly belongs to some other owner; and he may take the water in any direction which he pleases, except through a house or temple or sepulchre, but he must be careful to do no harm beyond the channel.</div><div class="sentence"> And if there be in any place a natural dryness of the earth, which keeps in the rain from heaven, and causes a deficiency in the supply of water, let him dig down on his own land as far as the clay, and if at this depth he finds no water, let him obtain water from his neighbours, as much as is required for his servants' drinking, and if his neighbours, too, are limited in their supply, let him have a fixed measure, which shall be determined by the wardens of the country.</div><div class="sentence"> This he shall receive each day, and on these terms have a share of his neighbours' water.</div><div class="sentence"> If there be heavy rain, and one of those on the lower ground injures some tiller of the upper ground, or some one who has a common wall, by refusing to give them an outlet for water; or, again, if some one living on the higher ground recklessly lets off the water on his lower neighbour, and they cannot come to terms with one another, let him who will call in a warden of the city, if he be in the city, or if he be in the country, a warden of the country, and let him obtain a decision determining what each of them is to do.</div><div class="sentence"> And he who will not abide by the decision shall suffer for his malignant and morose temper, and pay a fine to the injured party, equivalent to double the value of the injury, because he was unwilling to submit to the magistrates.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span> <div class="sentence">  Now of artisans, let the regulations be as follows: In the first place, let no citizen or servant of a citizen be occupied in handicraft arts; for he who is to secure and preserve the public order of the state, has an art which requires much study and many kinds of knowledge, and does not admit of being made a secondary occupation; and hardly any human being is capable of pursuing two professions or two arts rightly, or of practising one art himself, and superintending some one else who is practising another.</div><div class="sentence"> Let this, then, be our first principle in the state: No one who is a smith shall also be a carpenter, and if he be a carpenter, he shall not superintend the smith's art rather than his own, under the pretext that in superintending many servants who are working for him, he is likely to superintend them better, because more revenue will accrue to him from them than from his own art; but let every man in the state have one art, and get his living by that.</div><div class="sentence"> Let the wardens of the city labour to maintain this law, and if any citizen incline to any other art rather than the study of virtue, let them punish him with disgrace and infamy, until they bring him back into his own right course; and if any stranger profess two arts, let them chastise him with bonds and money penalties, and expulsion from the state, until they compel him to be one only and not many.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span> <div class="sentence">  With respect to food and the distribution of the produce of the country, the right and proper way seems to be nearly that which is the custom of Crete; for all should be required to distribute the fruits of the soil into twelve parts, and in this way consume them.</div><div class="sentence"> Let the twelfth portion of each as for instance of wheat and barley, to which the rest of the fruits of the earth shall be added, as well as the animals which are for sale in each of the twelve divisions, be divided in due proportion into three parts; one part for freemen, another for their servants, and a third for craftsmen and in general for strangers, whether sojourners who may be dwelling in the city, and like other men must live, or those who come on some business which they have with the state, or with some individual.</div><div class="sentence"> Let only this third part of all necessaries be required to be sold; out of the other two-thirds no one shall be compelled to sell.</div><div class="sentence"> And how will they be best distributed?</div><div class="sentence"> In the first place, we see clearly that the distribution will be of equals in one point of view, and in another point of view of unequals.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span> <div class="sentence">  In the second place, our citizens should have separate houses duly ordered; and this will be the order proper for men like them.</div><div class="sentence"> There shall be twelve hamlets, one in the middle of each twelfth portion, and in each hamlet they shall first set apart a market-place, and the temples of the Gods, and of their attendant demi-gods; and if there be any local deities of the Magnetes, or holy seats of other ancient deities, whose memory has been preserved, to these let them pay their ancient honours.</div><div class="sentence"> But Hestia, and Zeus, and Athene will have temples everywhere together with the God who presides in each of the twelve districts.</div><div class="sentence"> And the first erection of houses shall be around these temples, where the ground is highest, in order to provide the safest and most defensible place of retreat for the guards.</div><div class="sentence"> All the rest of the country they shall settle in the following manner: They shall make thirteen divisions of the craftsmen; one of them they shall establish in the city, and this, again, they shall subdivide into twelve lesser divisions, among the twelve districts of the city, and the remainder shall be distributed in the country round about; and in each village they shall settle various classes of craftsmen, with a view to the convenience of the husbandmen.</div><div class="sentence"> And the chief officers of the wardens of the country shall superintend all these matters, and see how many of them, and which class of them, each place requires; and fix them where they are likely to be least troublesome, and most useful to the husbandman.</div><div class="sentence"> And the wardens of the city shall see to similar matters in the city.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  There is a sense of disgrace in legislating, as we are about to do, for all the details of crime in a state which, as we say, is to be well regulated and will be perfectly adapted to the practice of virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> To assume that in such a state there will arise some one who will be guilty of crimes as heinous as any which are ever perpetrated in other states, and that we must legislate for him by anticipation, and threaten and make laws against him if he should arise, in order to deter him, and punish his acts, under the idea that he will arise—this, as I was saying, is in a manner disgraceful.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet seeing that we are not like the ancient legislators, who gave laws to heroes and sons of gods, being, according to the popular belief, themselves the offspring of the gods, and legislating for others, who were also the children of divine parents, but that we are only men who are legislating for the sons of men, there is no uncharitableness in apprehending that some one of our citizens may be like a seed which has touched the ox's horn, having a heart so hard that it cannot be softened any more than those seeds can be softened by fire.</div><div class="sentence"> Among our citizens there may be those who cannot be subdued by all the strength of the laws; and for their sake, though an ungracious task, I will proclaim my first law about the robbing of temples, in case any one should dare to commit such a crime.</div><div class="sentence"> I do not expect or imagine that any well-brought-up citizen will ever take the infection, but their servants, and strangers, and strangers' servants may be guilty of many impieties.</div><div class="sentence"> And with a view to them especially, and yet not without a provident eye to the weakness of human nature generally, I will proclaim the law about robbers of temples and similar incurable, or almost incurable, criminals.</div><div class="sentence"> Having already agreed that such enactments ought always to have a short prelude, we may speak to the criminal, whom some tormenting desire by night and by day tempts to go and rob a temple, the fewest possible words of admonition and exhortation:  O sir, we will say to him, the impulse which moves you to rob temples is not an ordinary human malady, nor yet a visitation of heaven, but a madness which is begotten in a man from ancient and unexpiated crimes of his race, an ever-recurring curse—against this you must guard with all your might, and how you are to guard we will explain to you.</div><div class="sentence"> When any such thought comes into your mind, go and perform expiations, go as a suppliant to the temples of the Gods who avert evils, go to the society of those who are called good men among you; hear them tell and yourself try to repeat after them, that every man should honour the noble and the just.</div><div class="sentence"> Fly from the company of the wicked—fly and turn not back; and if your disorder is lightened by these remedies, well and good, but if not, then acknowledge death to be nobler than life, and depart hence.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  Such are the preludes which we sing to all who have thoughts of unholy and treasonable actions, and to him who hearkens to them the law has nothing to say.</div><div class="sentence"> But to him who is disobedient when the prelude is over, cry with a loud voice—He who is taken in the act of robbing temples, if he be a slave or stranger, shall have his evil deed engraven on his face and hands, and shall be beaten with as many stripes as may seem good to the judges, and be cast naked beyond the borders of the land.</div><div class="sentence"> And if he suffers this punishment he will probably return to his right mind and be improved; for no penalty which the law inflicts is designed for evil, but always makes him who suffers either better or not so much worse as he would have been.</div><div class="sentence"> But if any citizen be found guilty of any great or unmentionable wrong, either in relation to the Gods, or his parents, or the state, let the judge deem him to be incurable, remembering that after receiving such an excellent education and training from youth upward, he has not abstained from the greatest of crimes.</div><div class="sentence"> His punishment shall be death, which to him will be the least of evils; and his example will benefit others, if he perish ingloriously, and be cast beyond the borders of the land.</div><div class="sentence"> But let his children and family, if they avoid the ways of their father, have glory, and let honourable mention be made of them, as having nobly and manfully escaped out of evil into good.</div><div class="sentence"> None of them should have their goods confiscated to the state, for the lots of the citizens ought always to continue the same and equal.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  Touching the exaction of penalties, when a man appears to have done anything which deserves a fine, he shall pay the fine, if he have anything in excess of the lot which is assigned to him; but more than that he shall not pay.</div><div class="sentence"> And to secure exactness, let the guardians of the law refer to the registers, and inform the judges of the precise truth, in order that none of the lots may go uncultivated for want of money.</div><div class="sentence"> But if any one seems to deserve a greater penalty, let him undergo a long and public imprisonment and be dishonoured, unless some of his friends are willing to be surety for him, and liberate him by assisting him to pay the fine.</div><div class="sentence"> No criminal shall go unpunished, not even for a single offence, nor if he have fled the country; but let the penalty be according to his deserts—death, or bonds, or blows, or degrading places of sitting or standing, or removal to some temple on the borders of the land; or let him pay fines, as we said before.</div><div class="sentence"> In cases of death, let the judges be the guardians of the law, and a court selected by merit from the last year's magistrates.</div><div class="sentence"> But how the causes are to be brought into court, how the summonses are to be served, and the like, these things may be left to the younger generation of legislators to determine; the manner of voting we must determine ourselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  Let the vote be given openly; but before they come to the vote let the judges sit in order of seniority over against plaintiff and defendant, and let all the citizens who can spare time hear and take a serious interest in listening to such causes.</div><div class="sentence"> First of all the plaintiff shall make one speech, and then the defendant shall make another; and after the speeches have been made the eldest judge shall begin to examine the parties, and proceed to make an adequate enquiry into what has been said; and after the oldest has spoken, the rest shall proceed in order to examine either party as to what he finds defective in the evidence, whether of statement or omission; and he who has nothing to ask shall hand over the examination to another.</div><div class="sentence"> And on so much of what has been said as is to the purpose all the judges shall set their seals, and place the writings on the altar of Hestia.</div><div class="sentence"> On the next day they shall meet again, and in like manner put their questions and go through the cause, and again set their seals upon the evidence; and when they have three times done this, and have had witnesses and evidence enough, they shall each of them give a holy vote, after promising by Hestia that they will decide justly and truly to the utmost of their power; and so they shall put an end to the suit.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  Next, after what relates to the Gods, follows what relates to the dissolution of the state: Whoever by permitting a man to power enslaves the laws, and subjects the city to factions, using violence and stirring up sedition contrary to law, him we will deem the greatest enemy of the whole state.</div><div class="sentence"> But he who takes no part in such proceedings, and, being one of the chief magistrates of the state, has no knowledge of treason, or, having knowledge of it, by reason of cowardice does not interfere on behalf of his country, such an one we must consider nearly as bad.</div><div class="sentence"> Every man who is worth anything will inform the magistrates, and bring the conspirator to trial for making a violent and illegal attempt to change the government.</div><div class="sentence"> The judges of such cases shall be the same as of the robbers of temples; and let the whole proceeding be carried on in the same way, and the vote of the majority condemn to death.</div><div class="sentence"> But let there be a general rule, that the disgrace and punishment of the father is not to be visited on the children, except in the case of some one whose father, grandfather, and great-grandfather have successively undergone the penalty of death.</div><div class="sentence"> Such persons the city shall send away with all their possessions to the city and country of their ancestors, retaining only and wholly their appointed lot.</div><div class="sentence"> And out of the citizens who have more than one son of not less than ten years of age, they shall select ten whom their father or grandfather by the mother's or father's side shall appoint, and let them send to Delphi the names of those who are selected, and him whom the God chooses they shall establish as heir of the house which has failed; and may he have better fortune than his predecessors!</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What makes you say, Stranger, that a theft is all one, whether the thief may have taken much or little, and either from sacred or secular places—and these are not the only differences in thefts—seeing, then, that they are of many kinds, ought not the legislator to adapt himself to them, and impose upon them entirely different penalties?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Excellent.</div><div class="sentence"> I was running on too fast, Cleinias, and you impinged upon me, and brought me to my senses, reminding me of what, indeed, had occurred to my mind already, that legislation was never yet rightly worked out, as I may say in passing.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you remember the image in which I likened the men for whom laws are now made to slaves who are doctored by slaves?</div><div class="sentence"> For of this you may be very sure, that if one of those empirical physicians, who practise medicine without science, were to come upon the gentleman physician talking to his gentleman patient, and using the language almost of philosophy, beginning at the beginning of the disease and discoursing about the whole nature of the body, he would burst into a hearty laugh—he would say what most of those who are called doctors always have at their tongue's end:  Foolish fellow, he would say, you are not healing the sick man, but you are educating him; and he does not want to be made a doctor, but to get well.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  And would he not be right?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Perhaps he would; and he might remark upon us, that he who discourses about laws, as we are now doing, is giving the citizens education and not laws; that would be rather a telling observation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But we are fortunate.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  In what way?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Inasmuch as we are not compelled to give laws, but we may take into consideration every form of government, and ascertain what is best and what is most needful, and how they may both be carried into execution; and we may also, if we please, at this very moment choose what is best, or, if we prefer, what is most necessary—which shall we do?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  There is something ridiculous, Stranger, in our proposing such an alternative, as if we were legislators, simply bound under some great necessity which cannot be deferred to the morrow.</div><div class="sentence"> But we, as I may by the grace of Heaven affirm, like gatherers of stones or beginners of some composite work, may gather a heap of materials, and out of this, at our leisure, select what is suitable for our projected construction.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us then suppose ourselves to be at leisure, not of necessity building, but rather like men who are partly providing materials, and partly putting them together.</div><div class="sentence"> And we may truly say that some of our laws, like stones, are already fixed in their places, and others lie at hand.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly, in that case, Cleinias, our view of law will be more in accordance with nature.</div><div class="sentence"> For there is another matter affecting legislators, which I must earnestly entreat you to consider.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And is it disgraceful for Homer and Tyrtaeus and other poets to lay down evil precepts in their writings respecting life and the pursuits of men, but not so disgraceful for Lycurgus and Solon and others who were legislators as well as writers?</div><div class="sentence"> Is it not true that of all the writings to be found in cities, those which relate to laws, when you unfold and read them, ought to be by far the noblest and the best?</div><div class="sentence"> and should not other writings either agree with them, or if they disagree, be deemed ridiculous?</div><div class="sentence"> We should consider whether the laws of states ought not to have the character of loving and wise parents, rather than of tyrants and masters, who command and threaten, and, after writing their decrees on walls, go their ways; and whether, in discoursing of laws, we should not take the gentler view of them which may or may not be attainable—at any rate, we will show our readiness to entertain such a view, and be prepared to undergo whatever may be the result.</div><div class="sentence"> And may the result be good, and if God be gracious, it will be good!</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  They would be quite right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Perhaps; but let us consider further, that if all things which are just are fair and honourable, in the term 'all' we must include just sufferings which are the correlatives of just actions.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The inference is, that a just action in partaking of the just partakes also in the same degree of the fair and honourable.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  We had enacted, if I am not mistaken, that the robber of temples, and he who was the enemy of law and order, might justly be put to death, and we were proceeding to make divers other enactments of a similar nature.</div><div class="sentence"> But we stopped short, because we saw that these sufferings are infinite in number and degree, and that they are, at once, the most just and also the most dishonourable of all sufferings.</div><div class="sentence"> And if this be true, are not the just and the honourable at one time all the same, and at another time in the most diametrical opposition?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">046</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Such appears to be the case.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I think that I have clearly stated in the former part of the discussion, but if I did not, let me now state—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  That all bad men are always involuntarily bad; and from this I must proceed to draw a further inference.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  That the unjust man may be bad, but that he is bad against his will.</div><div class="sentence"> Now that an action which is voluntary should be done involuntarily is a contradiction; wherefore he who maintains that injustice is involuntary will deem that the unjust does injustice involuntarily.</div><div class="sentence"> I too admit that all men do injustice involuntarily, and if any contentious or disputatious person says that men are unjust against their will, and yet that many do injustice willingly, I do not agree with him.</div><div class="sentence"> But, then, how can I avoid being inconsistent with myself, if you, Cleinias, and you, Megillus, say to me—Well, Stranger, if all this be as you say, how about legislating for the city of the Magnetes—shall we legislate or not—what do you advise?</div><div class="sentence"> Certainly we will, I should reply.</div><div class="sentence"> Then will you determine for them what are voluntary and what are involuntary crimes, and shall we make the punishments greater of voluntary errors and crimes and less for the involuntary?</div><div class="sentence"> or shall we make the punishment of all to be alike, under the idea that there is no such thing as voluntary crime?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good, Stranger; and what shall we say in answer to these objections?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  That is a very fair question.</div><div class="sentence"> In the first place, let us—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Do what?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us remember what has been well said by us already, that our ideas of justice are in the highest degree confused and contradictory.</div><div class="sentence"> Bearing this in mind, let us proceed to ask ourselves once more whether we have discovered a way out of the difficulty.</div><div class="sentence"> Have we ever determined in what respect these two classes of actions differ from one another?</div><div class="sentence"> For in all states and by all legislators whatsoever, two kinds of actions have been distinguished—the one, voluntary, the other, involuntary; and they have legislated about them accordingly.</div><div class="sentence"> But shall this new word of ours, like an oracle of God, be only spoken, and get away without giving any explanation or verification of itself?</div><div class="sentence"> How can a word not understood be the basis of legislation?</div><div class="sentence"> Impossible.</div><div class="sentence"> Before proceeding to legislate, then, we must prove that they are two, and what is the difference between them, that when we impose the penalty upon either, every one may understand our proposal, and be able in some way to judge whether the penalty is fitly or unfitly inflicted.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I agree with you, Stranger; for one of two things is certain:  either we must not say that all unjust acts are involuntary, or we must show the meaning and truth of this statement.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Of these two alternatives, the one is quite intolerable—not to speak what I believe to be the truth would be to me unlawful and unholy.</div><div class="sentence"> But if acts of injustice cannot be divided into voluntary and involuntary, I must endeavour to find some other distinction between them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true, Stranger; there cannot be two opinions among us upon that point.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Reflect, then; there are hurts of various kinds done by the citizens to one another in the intercourse of life, affording plentiful examples both of the voluntary and involuntary.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I would not have any one suppose that all these hurts are injuries, and that these injuries are of two kinds—one, voluntary, and the other, involuntary; for the involuntary hurts of all men are quite as many and as great as the voluntary.</div><div class="sentence"> And please to consider whether I am right or quite wrong in what I am going to say; for I deny, Cleinias and Megillus, that he who harms another involuntarily does him an injury involuntarily, nor should I legislate about such an act under the idea that I am legislating for an involuntary injury.</div><div class="sentence"> But I should rather say that such a hurt, whether great or small, is not an injury at all; and, on the other hand, if I am right, when a benefit is wrongly conferred, the author of the benefit may often be said to injure.</div><div class="sentence"> For I maintain, O my friends, that the mere giving or taking away of anything is not to be described either as just or unjust; but the legislator has to consider whether mankind do good or harm to one another out of a just principle and intention.</div><div class="sentence"> On the distinction between injustice and hurt he must fix his eye; and when there is hurt, he must, as far as he can, make the hurt good by law, and save that which is ruined, and raise up that which is fallen, and make that which is dead or wounded whole.</div><div class="sentence"> And when compensation has been given for injustice, the law must always seek to win over the doers and sufferers of the several hurts from feelings of enmity to those of friendship.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then as to unjust hurts (and gains also, supposing the injustice to bring gain), of these we may heal as many as are capable of being healed, regarding them as diseases of the soul; and the cure of injustice will take the following direction.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What direction?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  When any one commits any injustice, small or great, the law will admonish and compel him either never at all to do the like again, or never voluntarily, or at any rate in a far less degree; and he must in addition pay for the hurt.</div><div class="sentence"> Whether the end is to be attained by word or action, with pleasure or pain, by giving or taking away privileges, by means of fines or gifts, or in whatsoever way the law shall proceed to make a man hate injustice, and love or not hate the nature of the just—this is quite the noblest work of law.</div><div class="sentence"> But if the legislator sees any one who is incurable, for him he will appoint a law and a penalty.</div><div class="sentence"> He knows quite well that to such men themselves there is no profit in the continuance of their lives, and that they would do a double good to the rest of mankind if they would take their departure, inasmuch as they would be an example to other men not to offend, and they would relieve the city of bad citizens.</div><div class="sentence"> In such cases, and in such cases only, the legislator ought to inflict death as the punishment of offences.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What you have said appears to me to be very reasonable, but will you favour me by stating a little more clearly the difference between hurt and injustice, and the various complications of the voluntary and involuntary which enter into them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I will endeavour to do as you wish:  Concerning the soul, thus much would be generally said and allowed, that one element in her nature is passion, which may be described either as a state or a part of her, and is hard to be striven against and contended with, and by irrational force overturns many things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And pleasure is not the same with passion, but has an opposite power, working her will by persuasion and by the force of deceit in all things.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  A man may truly say that ignorance is a third cause of crimes.</div><div class="sentence"> Ignorance, however, may be conveniently divided by the legislator into two sorts:  there is simple ignorance, which is the source of lighter offences, and double ignorance, which is accompanied by a conceit of wisdom; and he who is under the influence of the latter fancies that he knows all about matters of which he knows nothing.</div><div class="sentence"> This second kind of ignorance, when possessed of power and strength, will be held by the legislator to be the source of great and monstrous crimes, but when attended with weakness, will only result in the errors of children and old men; and these he will treat as errors, and will make laws accordingly for those who commit them, which will be the mildest and most merciful of all laws.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">076</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  You are perfectly right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  We all of us remark of one man that he is superior to pleasure and passion, and of another that he is inferior to them; and this is true.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">079</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But no one was ever yet heard to say that one of us is superior and another inferior to ignorance.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">081</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  We are speaking of motives which incite men to the fulfilment of their will; although an individual may be often drawn by them in opposite directions at the same time.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">082</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, often.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">083</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And now I can define to you clearly, and without ambiguity, what I mean by the just and unjust, according to my notion of them:  When anger and fear, and pleasure and pain, and jealousies and desires, tyrannize over the soul, whether they do any harm or not—I call all this injustice.</div><div class="sentence"> But when the opinion of the best, in whatever part of human nature states or individuals may suppose that to dwell, has dominion in the soul and orders the life of every man, even if it be sometimes mistaken, yet what is done in accordance therewith, and the principle in individuals which obeys this rule, and is best for the whole life of man, is to be called just; although the hurt done by mistake is thought by many to be involuntary injustice.</div><div class="sentence"> Leaving the question of names, about which we are not going to quarrel, and having already delineated three sources of error, we may begin by recalling them somewhat more vividly to our memory:  One of them was of the painful sort, which we denominate anger and fear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">084</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">085</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  There was a second consisting of pleasures and desires, and a third of hopes, which aimed at true opinion about the best.</div><div class="sentence"> The latter being subdivided into three, we now get five sources of actions, and for these five we will make laws of two kinds.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">086</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What are the two kinds?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  There is one kind of actions done by violence and in the light of day, and another kind of actions which are done in darkness and with secret deceit, or sometimes both with violence and deceit; the laws concerning these last ought to have a character of severity.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">088</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Naturally.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And now let us return from this digression and complete the work of legislation.</div><div class="sentence"> Laws have been already enacted by us concerning the robbers of the Gods, and concerning traitors, and also concerning those who corrupt the laws for the purpose of subverting the government.</div><div class="sentence"> A man may very likely commit some of these crimes, either in a state of madness or when affected by disease, or under the influence of extreme old age, or in a fit of childish wantonness, himself no better than a child.</div><div class="sentence"> And if this be made evident to the judges elected to try the cause, on the appeal of the criminal or his advocate, and he be judged to have been in this state when he committed the offence, he shall simply pay for the hurt which he may have done to another; but he shall be exempt from other penalties, unless he have slain some one, and have on his hands the stain of blood.</div><div class="sentence"> And in that case he shall go to another land and country, and there dwell for a year; and if he return before the expiration of the time which the law appoints, or even set his foot at all on his native land, he shall be bound by the guardians of the law in the public prison for two years, and then go free.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span> <div class="sentence">  Having begun to speak of homicide, let us endeavour to lay down laws concerning every different kind of homicide; and, first of all, concerning violent and involuntary homicides.</div><div class="sentence"> If any one in an athletic contest, and at the public games, involuntarily kills a friend, and he dies either at the time or afterwards of the blows which he has received; or if the like misfortune happens to any one in war, or military exercises, or mimic contests of which the magistrates enjoin the practice, whether with or without arms, when he has been purified according to the law brought from Delphi relating to these matters, he shall be innocent.</div><div class="sentence"> And so in the case of physicians: if their patient dies against their will, they shall be held guiltless by the law.</div><div class="sentence"> And if one slay another with his own hand, but unintentionally, whether he be unarmed or have some instrument or dart in his hand; or if he kill him by administering food or drink, or by the application of fire or cold, or by suffocating him, whether he do the deed by his own hand, or by the agency of others, he shall be deemed the agent, and shall suffer one of the following penalties: If he kill the slave of another in the belief that he is his own, he shall bear the master of the dead man harmless from loss, or shall pay a penalty of twice the value of the dead man, which the judges shall assess; but purifications must be used greater and more numerous than for those who committed homicide at the games—what they are to be, the interpreters whom the God appoints shall be authorised to declare.</div><div class="sentence"> And if a man kills his own slave, when he has been purified according to law, he shall be quit of the homicide.</div><div class="sentence"> And if a man kills a freeman unintentionally, he shall undergo the same purification as he did who killed the slave.</div><div class="sentence"> But let him not forget also a tale of olden time, which is to this effect: He who has suffered a violent end, when newly dead, if he has had the soul of a freeman in life, is angry with the author of his death; and being himself full of fear and panic by reason of his violent end, when he sees his murderer walking about in his own accustomed haunts, he is stricken with terror and becomes disordered, and this disorder of his, aided by the guilty recollection of the other, is communicated by him with overwhelming force to the murderer and his deeds.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore also the murderer must go out of the way of his victim for the entire period of a year, and not himself be found in any spot which was familiar to him throughout the country.</div><div class="sentence"> And if the dead man be a stranger, the homicide shall be kept from the country of the stranger during a like period.</div><div class="sentence"> If any one voluntarily obeys this law, the next of kin to the deceased, seeing all that has happened, shall take pity on him, and make peace with him, and show him all gentleness.</div><div class="sentence"> But if any one is disobedient, and either ventures to go to any of the temples and sacrifice unpurified, or will not continue in exile during the appointed time, the next of kin to the deceased shall proceed against him for murder; and if he be convicted, every part of his punishment shall be doubled.</div><div class="sentence"> And if the next of kin do not proceed against the perpetrator of the crime, then the pollution shall be deemed to fall upon his own head—the murdered man will fix the guilt upon his kinsman, and he who has a mind to proceed against him may compel him to be absent from his country during five years, according to law.</div><div class="sentence"> If a stranger unintentionally kill a stranger who is dwelling in the city, he who likes shall prosecute the cause according to the same rules.</div><div class="sentence"> If he be a metic, let him be absent for a year, or if he be an entire stranger, in addition to the purification, whether he have slain a stranger, or a metic, or a citizen, he shall be banished for life from the country which is in possession of our laws.</div><div class="sentence"> And if he return contrary to law, let the guardians of the law punish him with death; and let them hand over his property, if he have any, to him who is next of kin to the sufferer.</div><div class="sentence"> And if he be wrecked, and driven on the coast against his will, he shall take up his abode on the seashore, wetting his feet in the sea, and watching for an opportunity of sailing; but if he be brought by land, and is not his own master, let the magistrate whom he first comes across in the city, release him and send him unharmed over the border.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span> <div class="sentence">  If any one slays a freeman with his own hand, and the deed be done in passion, in the case of such actions we must begin by making a distinction.</div><div class="sentence"> For a deed is done from passion either when men suddenly, and without intention to kill, cause the death of another by blows and the like on a momentary impulse, and are sorry for the deed immediately afterwards; or again, when after having been insulted in deed or word, men pursue revenge, and kill a person intentionally, and are not sorry for the act.</div><div class="sentence"> And, therefore, we must assume that these homicides are of two kinds, both of them arising from passion, which may be justly said to be in a mean between the voluntary and involuntary; at the same time, they are neither of them anything more than a likeness or shadow of either.</div><div class="sentence"> He who treasures up his anger, and avenges himself, not immediately and at the moment, but with insidious design, and after an interval, is like the voluntary; but he who does not treasure up his anger, and takes vengeance on the instant, and without malice prepense, approaches to the involuntary; and yet even he is not altogether involuntary, but is only the image or shadow of the involuntary; wherefore about homicides committed in hot blood, there is a difficulty in determining whether in legislating we shall reckon them as voluntary or as partly involuntary.</div><div class="sentence"> The best and truest view is to regard them respectively as likenesses only of the voluntary and involuntary, and to distinguish them accordingly as they are done with or without premeditation.</div><div class="sentence"> And we should make the penalties heavier for those who commit homicide with angry premeditation, and lighter for those who do not premeditate, but smite upon the instant; for that which is like a greater evil should be punished more severely, and that which is like a less evil should be punished less severely: this shall be the rule of our laws.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">093</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us proceed:  If any one slays a freeman with his own hand, and the deed be done in a moment of anger, and without premeditation, let the offender suffer in other respects as the involuntary homicide would have suffered, and also undergo an exile of two years, that he may learn to school his passions.</div><div class="sentence"> But he who slays another from passion, yet with premeditation, shall in other respects suffer as the former; and to this shall be added an exile of three instead of two years—his punishment is to be longer because his passion is greater.</div><div class="sentence"> The manner of their return shall be on this wise:  (and here the law has difficulty in determining exactly; for in some cases the murderer who is judged by the law to be the worse may really be the less cruel, and he who is judged the less cruel may be really the worse, and may have executed the murder in a more savage manner, whereas the other may have been gentler.</div><div class="sentence"> But in general the degrees of guilt will be such as we have described them.</div><div class="sentence"> Of all these things the guardians of the law must take cognizance):  When a homicide of either kind has completed his term of exile, the guardians shall send twelve judges to the borders of the land; these during the interval shall have informed themselves of the actions of the criminals, and they shall judge respecting their pardon and reception; and the homicides shall abide by their judgment.</div><div class="sentence"> But if after they have returned home, any one of them in a moment of anger repeats the deed, let him be an exile, and return no more; or if he returns, let him suffer as the stranger was to suffer in a similar case.</div><div class="sentence"> He who kills his own slave shall undergo a purification, but if he kills the slave of another in anger, he shall pay twice the amount of the loss to his owner.</div><div class="sentence"> And if any homicide is disobedient to the law, and without purification pollutes the agora, or the games, or the temples, he who pleases may bring to trial the next of kin to the dead man for permitting him, and the murderer with him, and may compel the one to exact and the other to suffer a double amount of fines and purifications; and the accuser shall himself receive the fine in accordance with the law.</div><div class="sentence"> If a slave in a fit of passion kills his master, the kindred of the deceased man may do with the murderer (provided only they do not spare his life) whatever they please, and they will be pure; or if he kills a freeman, who is not his master, the owner shall give up the slave to the relatives of the deceased, and they shall be under an obligation to put him to death, but this may be done in any manner which they please.</div><div class="sentence"> And if (which is a rare occurrence, but does sometimes happen) a father or a mother in a moment of passion slays a son or daughter by blows, or some other violence, the slayer shall undergo the same purification as in other cases, and be exiled during three years; but when the exile returns the wife shall separate from the husband, and the husband from the wife, and they shall never afterwards beget children together, or live under the same roof, or partake of the same sacred rites with those whom they have deprived of a child or of a brother.</div><div class="sentence"> And he who is impious and disobedient in such a case shall be brought to trial for impiety by any one who pleases.</div><div class="sentence"> If in a fit of anger a husband kills his wedded wife, or the wife her husband, the slayer shall undergo the same purification, and the term of exile shall be three years.</div><div class="sentence"> And when he who has committed any such crime returns, let him have no communication in sacred rites with his children, neither let him sit at the same table with them, and the father or son who disobeys shall be liable to be brought to trial for impiety by any one who pleases.</div><div class="sentence"> If a brother or a sister in a fit of passion kills a brother or a sister, they shall undergo purification and exile, as was the case with parents who killed their offspring:  they shall not come under the same roof, or share in the sacred rites of those whom they have deprived of their brethren, or of their children.</div><div class="sentence"> And he who is disobedient shall be justly liable to the law concerning impiety, which relates to these matters.</div><div class="sentence"> If any one is so violent in his passion against his parents, that in the madness of his anger he dares to kill one of them, if the murdered person before dying freely forgives the murderer, let him undergo the purification which is assigned to those who have been guilty of involuntary homicide, and do as they do, and he shall be pure.</div><div class="sentence"> But if he be not acquitted, the perpetrator of such a deed shall be amenable to many laws—he shall be amenable to the extreme punishments for assault, and impiety, and robbing of temples, for he has robbed his parent of life; and if a man could be slain more than once, most justly would he who in a fit of passion has slain father or mother, undergo many deaths.</div><div class="sentence"> How can he, whom, alone of all men, even in defence of his life, and when about to suffer death at the hands of his parents, no law will allow to kill his father or his mother who are the authors of his being, and whom the legislator will command to endure any extremity rather than do this—how can he, I say, lawfully receive any other punishment?</div><div class="sentence"> Let death then be the appointed punishment of him who in a fit of passion slays his father or his mother.</div><div class="sentence"> But if brother kills brother in a civil broil, or under other like circumstances, if the other has begun, and he only defends himself, let him be free from guilt, as he would be if he had slain an enemy; and the same rule will apply if a citizen kill a citizen, or a stranger a stranger.</div><div class="sentence"> Or if a stranger kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger in self-defence, let him be free from guilt in like manner; and so in the case of a slave who has killed a slave; but if a slave have killed a freeman in self-defence, let him be subject to the same law as he who has killed a father; and let the law about the remission of penalties in the case of parricide apply equally to every other remission.</div><div class="sentence"> Whenever any sufferer of his own accord remits the guilt of homicide to another, under the idea that his act was involuntary, let the perpetrator of the deed undergo a purification and remain in exile for a year, according to law.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span> <div class="sentence">  Enough has been said of murders violent and involuntary and committed in passion: we have now to speak of voluntary crimes done with injustice of every kind and with premeditation, through the influence of pleasures, and desires, and jealousies.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us first speak, as far as we are able, of their various kinds.</div><div class="sentence"> The greatest cause of them is lust, which gets the mastery of the soul maddened by desire; and this is most commonly found to exist where the passion reigns which is strongest and most prevalent among the mass of mankind:  I mean where the power of wealth breeds endless desires of never-to-be-satisfied acquisition, originating in natural disposition, and a miserable want of education.</div><div class="sentence"> Of this want of education, the false praise of wealth which is bruited about both among Hellenes and barbarians is the cause; they deem that to be the first of goods which in reality is only the third.</div><div class="sentence"> And in this way they wrong both posterity and themselves, for nothing can be nobler and better than that the truth about wealth should be spoken in all states—namely, that riches are for the sake of the body, as the body is for the sake of the soul.</div><div class="sentence"> They are good, and wealth is intended by nature to be for the sake of them, and is therefore inferior to them both, and third in order of excellence.</div><div class="sentence"> This argument teaches us that he who would be happy ought not to seek to be rich, or rather he should seek to be rich justly and temperately, and then there would be no murders in states requiring to be purged away by other murders.</div><div class="sentence"> But now, as I said at first, avarice is the chiefest cause and source of the worst trials for voluntary homicide.</div><div class="sentence"> A second cause is ambition:  this creates jealousies, which are troublesome companions, above all to the jealous man himself, and in a less degree to the chiefs of the state.</div><div class="sentence"> And a third cause is cowardly and unjust fear, which has been the occasion of many murders.</div><div class="sentence"> When a man is doing or has done something which he desires that no one should know him to be doing or to have done, he will take the life of those who are likely to inform of such things, if he have no other means of getting rid of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Let this be said as a prelude concerning crimes of violence in general; and I must not omit to mention a tradition which is firmly believed by many, and has been received by them from those who are learned in the mysteries:  they say that such deeds will be punished in the world below, and also that when the perpetrators return to this world they will pay the natural penalty which is due to the sufferer, and end their lives in like manner by the hand of another.</div><div class="sentence"> If he who is about to commit murder believes this, and is made by the mere prelude to dread such a penalty, there is no need to proceed with the proclamation of the law.</div><div class="sentence"> But if he will not listen, let the following law be declared and registered against him:  Whoever shall wrongfully and of design slay with his own hand any of his kinsmen, shall in the first place be deprived of legal privileges; and he shall not pollute the temples, or the agora, or the harbours, or any other place of meeting, whether he is forbidden of men or not; for the law, which represents the whole state, forbids him, and always is and will be in the attitude of forbidding him.</div><div class="sentence"> And if a cousin or nearer relative of the deceased, whether on the male or female side, does not prosecute the homicide when he ought, and have him proclaimed an outlaw, he shall in the first place be involved in the pollution, and incur the hatred of the Gods, even as the curse of the law stirs up the voices of men against him; and in the second place he shall be liable to be prosecuted by any one who is willing to inflict retribution on behalf of the dead.</div><div class="sentence"> And he who would avenge a murder shall observe all the precautionary ceremonies of lavation, and any others which the God commands in cases of this kind.</div><div class="sentence"> Let him have proclamation made, and then go forth and compel the perpetrator to suffer the execution of justice according to the law.</div><div class="sentence"> Now the legislator may easily show that these things must be accomplished by prayers and sacrifices to certain Gods, who are concerned with the prevention of murders in states.</div><div class="sentence"> But who these Gods are, and what should be the true manner of instituting such trials with due regard to religion, the guardians of the law, aided by the interpreters, and the prophets, and the God, shall determine, and when they have determined let them carry on the prosecution at law.</div><div class="sentence"> The cause shall have the same judges who are appointed to decide in the case of those who plunder temples.</div><div class="sentence"> Let him who is convicted be punished with death, and let him not be buried in the country of the murdered man, for this would be shameless as well as impious.</div><div class="sentence"> But if he fly and will not stand his trial, let him fly for ever; or, if he set foot anywhere on any part of the murdered man's country, let any relation of the deceased, or any other citizen who may first happen to meet with him, kill him with impunity, or bind and deliver him to those among the judges of the case who are magistrates, that they may put him to death.</div><div class="sentence"> And let the prosecutor demand surety of him whom he prosecutes; three sureties sufficient in the opinion of the magistrates who try the cause shall be provided by him, and they shall undertake to produce him at the trial.</div><div class="sentence"> But if he be unwilling or unable to provide sureties, then the magistrates shall take him and keep him in bonds, and produce him at the day of trial.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span> <div class="sentence">  If a man do not commit a murder with his own hand, but contrives the death of another, and is the author of the deed in intention and design, and he continues to dwell in the city, having his soul not pure of the guilt of murder, let him be tried in the same way, except in what relates to the sureties; and also, if he be found guilty, his body after execution may have burial in his native land, but in all other respects his case shall be as the former; and whether a stranger shall kill a citizen, or a citizen a stranger, or a slave a slave, there shall be no difference as touching murder by one's own hand or by contrivance, except in the matter of sureties; and these, as has been said, shall be required of the actual murderer only, and he who brings the accusation shall bind them over at the time.</div><div class="sentence"> If a slave be convicted of slaying a freeman voluntarily, either by his own hand or by contrivance, let the public executioner take him in the direction of the sepulchre, to a place whence he can see the tomb of the dead man, and inflict upon him as many stripes as the person who caught him orders, and if he survive, let him put him to death.</div><div class="sentence"> And if any one kills a slave who has done no wrong, because he is afraid that he may inform of some base and evil deeds of his own, or for any similar reason, in such a case let him pay the penalty of murder, as he would have done if he had slain a citizen.</div><div class="sentence"> There are things about which it is terrible and unpleasant to legislate, but impossible not to legislate.</div><div class="sentence"> If, for example, there should be murders of kinsmen, either perpetrated by the hands of kinsmen, or by their contrivance, voluntary and purely malicious, which most often happen in ill-regulated and ill-educated states, and may perhaps occur even in a country where a man would not expect to find them, we must repeat once more the tale which we narrated a little while ago, in the hope that he who hears us will be the more disposed to abstain voluntarily on these grounds from murders which are utterly abominable.</div><div class="sentence"> For the myth, or saying, or whatever we ought to call it, has been plainly set forth by priests of old; they have pronounced that the justice which guards and avenges the blood of kindred, follows the law of retaliation, and ordains that he who has done any murderous act should of necessity suffer that which he has done.</div><div class="sentence"> He who has slain a father shall himself be slain at some time or other by his children—if a mother, he shall of necessity take a woman's nature, and lose his life at the hands of his offspring in after ages; for where the blood of a family has been polluted there is no other purification, nor can the pollution be washed out until the homicidal soul which did the deed has given life for life, and has propitiated and laid to sleep the wrath of the whole family.</div><div class="sentence"> These are the retributions of Heaven, and by such punishments men should be deterred.</div><div class="sentence"> But if they are not deterred, and any one should be incited by some fatality to deprive his father, or mother, or brethren, or children, of life voluntarily and of purpose, for him the earthly lawgiver legislates as follows: There shall be the same proclamations about outlawry, and there shall be the same sureties which have been enacted in the former cases.</div><div class="sentence"> But in his case, if he be convicted, the servants of the judges and the magistrates shall slay him at an appointed place without the city where three ways meet, and there expose his body naked, and each of the magistrates on behalf of the whole city shall take a stone and cast it upon the head of the dead man, and so deliver the city from pollution; after that, they shall bear him to the borders of the land, and cast him forth unburied, according to law.</div><div class="sentence"> And what shall he suffer who slays him who of all men, as they say, is his own best friend?</div><div class="sentence"> I mean the suicide, who deprives himself by violence of his appointed share of life, not because the law of the state requires him, nor yet under the compulsion of some painful and inevitable misfortune which has come upon him, nor because he has had to suffer from irremediable and intolerable shame, but who from sloth or want of manliness imposes upon himself an unjust penalty.</div><div class="sentence"> For him, what ceremonies there are to be of purification and burial God knows, and about these the next of kin should enquire of the interpreters and of the laws thereto relating, and do according to their injunctions.</div><div class="sentence"> They who meet their death in this way shall be buried alone, and none shall be laid by their side; they shall be buried ingloriously in the borders of the twelve portions of the land, in such places as are uncultivated and nameless, and no column or inscription shall mark the place of their interment.</div><div class="sentence"> And if a beast of burden or other animal cause the death of any one, except in the case of anything of that kind happening to a competitor in the public contests, the kinsmen of the deceased shall prosecute the slayer for murder, and the wardens of the country, such, and so many as the kinsmen appoint, shall try the cause, and let the beast when condemned be slain by them, and let them cast it beyond the borders.</div><div class="sentence"> And if any lifeless thing deprive a man of life, except in the case of a thunderbolt or other fatal dart sent from the Gods—whether a man is killed by lifeless objects falling upon him, or by his falling upon them, the nearest of kin shall appoint the nearest neighbour to be a judge, and thereby acquit himself and the whole family of guilt.</div><div class="sentence"> And he shall cast forth the guilty thing beyond the border, as has been said about the animals.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">098</span> <div class="sentence">  If a man is found dead, and his murderer be unknown, and after a diligent search cannot be detected, there shall be the same proclamation as in the previous cases, and the same interdict on the murderer; and having proceeded against him, they shall proclaim in the agora by a herald, that he who has slain such and such a person, and has been convicted of murder, shall not set his foot in the temples, nor at all in the country of the murdered man, and if he appears and is discovered, he shall die, and be cast forth unburied beyond the border.</div><div class="sentence"> Let this one law then be laid down by us about murder; and let cases of this sort be so regarded.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span> <div class="sentence">  And now let us say in what cases and under what circumstances the murderer is rightly free from guilt: If a man catch a thief coming into his house by night to steal, and he take and kill him, or if he slay a footpad in self-defence, he shall be guiltless.</div><div class="sentence"> And any one who does violence to a free woman or a youth, shall be slain with impunity by the injured person, or by his or her father or brothers or sons.</div><div class="sentence"> If a man find his wife suffering violence, he may kill the violator, and be guiltless in the eye of the law; or if a person kill another in warding off death from his father or mother or children or brethren or wife who are doing no wrong, he shall assuredly be guiltless.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">100</span> <div class="sentence">  Thus much as to the nurture and education of the living soul of man, having which, he can, and without which, if he unfortunately be without them, he cannot live; and also concerning the punishments which are to be inflicted for violent deaths, let thus much be enacted.</div><div class="sentence"> Of the nurture and education of the body we have spoken before, and next in order we have to speak of deeds of violence, voluntary and involuntary, which men do to one another; these we will now distinguish, as far as we are able, according to their nature and number, and determine what will be the suitable penalties of each, and so assign to them their proper place in the series of our enactments.</div><div class="sentence"> The poorest legislator will have no difficulty in determining that wounds and mutilations arising out of wounds should follow next in order after deaths.</div><div class="sentence"> Let wounds be divided as homicides were divided—into those which are involuntary, and which are given in passion or from fear, and those inflicted voluntarily and with premeditation.</div><div class="sentence"> Concerning all this, we must make some such proclamation as the following: Mankind must have laws, and conform to them, or their life would be as bad as that of the most savage beast.</div><div class="sentence"> And the reason of this is that no man's nature is able to know what is best for human society; or knowing, always able and willing to do what is best.</div><div class="sentence"> In the first place, there is a difficulty in apprehending that the true art of politics is concerned, not with private but with public good (for public good binds together states, but private only distracts them); and that both the public and private good as well of individuals as of states is greater when the state and not the individual is first considered.</div><div class="sentence"> In the second place, although a person knows in the abstract that this is true, yet if he be possessed of absolute and irresponsible power, he will never remain firm in his principles or persist in regarding the public good as primary in the state, and the private good as secondary.</div><div class="sentence"> Human nature will be always drawing him into avarice and selfishness, avoiding pain and pursuing pleasure without any reason, and will bring these to the front, obscuring the juster and better; and so working darkness in his soul will at last fill with evils both him and the whole city.</div><div class="sentence"> For if a man were born so divinely gifted that he could naturally apprehend the truth, he would have no need of laws to rule over him; for there is no law or order which is above knowledge, nor can mind, without impiety, be deemed the subject or slave of any man, but rather the lord of all.</div><div class="sentence"> I speak of mind, true and free, and in harmony with nature.</div><div class="sentence"> But then there is no such mind anywhere, or at least not much; and therefore we must choose law and order, which are second best.</div><div class="sentence"> These look at things as they exist for the most part only, and are unable to survey the whole of them.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore I have spoken as I have.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span> <div class="sentence">  And now we will determine what penalty he ought to pay or suffer who has hurt or wounded another.</div><div class="sentence"> Any one may easily imagine the questions which have to be asked in all such cases: What did he wound, or whom, or how, or when?</div><div class="sentence"> for there are innumerable particulars of this sort which greatly vary from one another.</div><div class="sentence"> And to allow courts of law to determine all these things, or not to determine any of them, is alike impossible.</div><div class="sentence"> There is one particular which they must determine in all cases—the question of fact.</div><div class="sentence"> And then, again, that the legislator should not permit them to determine what punishment is to be inflicted in any of these cases, but should himself decide about all of them, small or great, is next to impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Then what is to be the inference?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">103</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  The inference is, that some things should be left to courts of law; others the legislator must decide for himself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  And what ought the legislator to decide, and what ought he to leave to the courts of law?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I may reply, that in a state in which the courts are bad and mute, because the judges conceal their opinions and decide causes clandestinely; or what is worse, when they are disorderly and noisy, as in a theatre, clapping or hooting in turn this or that orator—I say that then there is a very serious evil, which affects the whole state.</div><div class="sentence"> Unfortunate is the necessity of having to legislate for such courts, but where the necessity exists, the legislator should only allow them to ordain the penalties for the smallest offences; if the state for which he is legislating be of this character, he must take most matters into his own hands and speak distinctly.</div><div class="sentence"> But when a state has good courts, and the judges are well trained and scrupulously tested, the determination of the penalties or punishments which shall be inflicted on the guilty may fairly and with advantage be left to them.</div><div class="sentence"> And we are not to be blamed for not legislating concerning all that large class of matters which judges far worse educated than ours would be able to determine, assigning to each offence what is due both to the perpetrator and to the sufferer.</div><div class="sentence"> We believe those for whom we are legislating to be best able to judge, and therefore to them the greater part may be left.</div><div class="sentence"> At the same time, as I have often said, we should exhibit to the judges, as we have done, the outline and form of the punishments to be inflicted, and then they will not transgress the just rule.</div><div class="sentence"> That was an excellent practice, which we observed before, and which now that we are resuming the work of legislation, may with advantage be repeated by us.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  In the first place, my dear friend, these people would say that the Gods exist not by nature, but by art, and by the laws of states, which are different in different places, according to the agreement of those who make them; and that the honourable is one thing by nature and another thing by law, and that the principles of justice have no existence at all in nature, but that mankind are always disputing about them and altering them; and that the alterations which are made by art and by law have no basis in nature, but are of authority for the moment and at the time at which they are made.</div><div class="sentence"> These, my friends, are the sayings of wise men, poets and prose writers, which find a way into the minds of youth.</div><div class="sentence"> They are told by them that the highest right is might, and in this way the young fall into impieties, under the idea that the Gods are not such as the law bids them imagine; and hence arise factions, these philosophers inviting them to lead a true life according to nature, that is, to live in real dominion over others, and not in legal subjection to them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What a dreadful picture, Stranger, have you given, and how great is the injury which is thus inflicted on young men to the ruin both of states and families!</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  True, Cleinias; but then what should the lawgiver do when this evil is of long standing?</div><div class="sentence"> should he only rise up in the state and threaten all mankind, proclaiming that if they will not say and think that the Gods are such as the law ordains (and this may be extended generally to the honourable, the just, and to all the highest things, and to all that relates to virtue and vice), and if they will not make their actions conform to the copy which the law gives them, then he who refuses to obey the law shall die, or suffer stripes and bonds, or privation of citizenship, or in some cases be punished by loss of property and exile?</div><div class="sentence"> Should he not rather, when he is making laws for men, at the same time infuse the spirit of persuasion into his words, and mitigate the severity of them as far as he can?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Why, Stranger, if such persuasion be at all possible, then a legislator who has anything in him ought never to weary of persuading men; he ought to leave nothing unsaid in support of the ancient opinion that there are Gods, and of all those other truths which you were just now mentioning; he ought to support the law and also art, and acknowledge that both alike exist by nature, and no less than nature, if they are the creations of mind in accordance with right reason, as you appear to me to maintain, and I am disposed to agree with you in thinking.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, my enthusiastic Cleinias; but are not these things when spoken to a multitude hard to be understood, not to mention that they take up a dismal length of time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Why, Stranger, shall we, whose patience failed not when drinking or music were the themes of discourse, weary now of discoursing about the Gods, and about divine things?</div><div class="sentence"> And the greatest help to rational legislation is that the laws when once written down are always at rest; they can be put to the test at any future time, and therefore, if on first hearing they seem difficult, there is no reason for apprehension about them, because any man however dull can go over them and consider them again and again; nor if they are tedious but useful, is there any reason or religion, as it seems to me, in any man refusing to maintain the principles of them to the utmost of his power.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Stranger, I like what Cleinias is saying.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">040</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Megillus, and we should do as he proposes; for if impious discourses were not scattered, as I may say, throughout the world, there would have been no need for any vindication of the existence of the Gods—but seeing that they are spread far and wide, such arguments are needed; and who should come to the rescue of the greatest laws, when they are being undermined by bad men, but the legislator himself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  There is no more proper champion of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, tell me, Cleinias—for I must ask you to be my partner—does not he who talks in this way conceive fire and water and earth and air to be the first elements of all things?</div><div class="sentence"> these he calls nature, and out of these he supposes the soul to be formed afterwards; and this is not a mere conjecture of ours about his meaning, but is what he really means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">043</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">044</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then, by Heaven, we have discovered the source of this vain opinion of all those physical investigators; and I would have you examine their arguments with the utmost care, for their impiety is a very serious matter; they not only make a bad and mistaken use of argument, but they lead away the minds of others:  that is my opinion of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  You are right; but I should like to know how this happens.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">046</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I fear that the argument may seem singular.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">047</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Do not hesitate, Stranger; I see that you are afraid of such a discussion carrying you beyond the limits of legislation.</div><div class="sentence"> But if there be no other way of showing our agreement in the belief that there are Gods, of whom the law is said now to approve, let us take this way, my good sir.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">048</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then I suppose that I must repeat the singular argument of those who manufacture the soul according to their own impious notions; they affirm that which is the first cause of the generation and destruction of all things, to be not first, but last, and that which is last to be first, and hence they have fallen into error about the true nature of the Gods.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">049</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Still I do not understand you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">050</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Nearly all of them, my friends, seem to be ignorant of the nature and power of the soul, especially in what relates to her origin:  they do not know that she is among the first of things, and before all bodies, and is the chief author of their changes and transpositions.</div><div class="sentence"> And if this is true, and if the soul is older than the body, must not the things which are of the soul's kindred be of necessity prior to those which appertain to the body?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then thought and attention and mind and art and law will be prior to that which is hard and soft and heavy and light; and the great and primitive works and actions will be works of art; they will be the first, and after them will come nature and works of nature, which however is a wrong term for men to apply to them; these will follow, and will be under the government of art and mind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  But why is the word 'nature' wrong?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Because those who use the term mean to say that nature is the first creative power; but if the soul turn out to be the primeval element, and not fire or air, then in the truest sense and beyond other things the soul may be said to exist by nature; and this would be true if you proved that the soul is older than the body, but not otherwise.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  You are quite right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Shall we, then, take this as the next point to which our attention should be directed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us be on our guard lest this most deceptive argument with its youthful looks, beguiling us old men, give us the slip and make a laughing-stock of us.</div><div class="sentence"> Who knows but we may be aiming at the greater, and fail of attaining the lesser?</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose that we three have to pass a rapid river, and I, being the youngest of the three and experienced in rivers, take upon me the duty of making the attempt first by myself; leaving you in safety on the bank, I am to examine whether the river is passable by older men like yourselves, and if such appears to be the case then I shall invite you to follow, and my experience will help to convey you across; but if the river is impassable by you, then there will have been no danger to anybody but myself—would not that seem to be a very fair proposal?</div><div class="sentence"> I mean to say that the argument in prospect is likely to be too much for you, out of your depth and beyond your strength, and I should be afraid that the stream of my questions might create in you who are not in the habit of answering, giddiness and confusion of mind, and hence a feeling of unpleasantness and unsuitableness might arise.</div><div class="sentence"> I think therefore that I had better first ask the questions and then answer them myself while you listen in safety; in that way I can carry on the argument until I have completed the proof that the soul is prior to the body.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Excellent, Stranger, and I hope that you will do as you propose.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Come, then, and if ever we are to call upon the Gods, let us call upon them now in all seriousness to come to the demonstration of their own existence.</div><div class="sentence"> And so holding fast to the rope we will venture upon the depths of the argument.</div><div class="sentence"> When questions of this sort are asked of me, my safest answer would appear to be as follows:  Some one says to me, 'O Stranger, are all things at rest and nothing in motion, or is the exact opposite of this true, or are some things in motion and others at rest?'</div><div class="sentence"> To this I shall reply that some things are in motion and others at rest.</div><div class="sentence"> 'And do not things which move move in a place, and are not the things which are at rest at rest in a place?'</div><div class="sentence"> Certainly.</div><div class="sentence"> 'And some move or rest in one place and some in more places than one?'</div><div class="sentence"> You mean to say, we shall rejoin, that those things which rest at the centre move in one place, just as the circumference goes round of globes which are said to be at rest?</div><div class="sentence"> 'Yes.'</div><div class="sentence"> And we observe that, in the revolution, the motion which carries round the larger and the lesser circle at the same time is proportionally distributed to greater and smaller, and is greater and smaller in a certain proportion.</div><div class="sentence"> Here is a wonder which might be thought an impossibility, that the same motion should impart swiftness and slowness in due proportion to larger and lesser circles.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Very true.'</div><div class="sentence"> And when you speak of bodies moving in many places, you seem to me to mean those which move from one place to another, and sometimes have one centre of motion and sometimes more than one because they turn upon their axis; and whenever they meet anything, if it be stationary, they are divided by it; but if they get in the midst between bodies which are approaching and moving towards the same spot from opposite directions, they unite with them.</div><div class="sentence"> 'I admit the truth of what you are saying.'</div><div class="sentence"> Also when they unite they grow, and when they are divided they waste away—that is, supposing the constitution of each to remain, or if that fails, then there is a second reason of their dissolution.</div><div class="sentence"> 'And when are all things created and how?'</div><div class="sentence"> Clearly, they are created when the first principle receives increase and attains to the second dimension, and from this arrives at the one which is neighbour to this, and after reaching the third becomes perceptible to sense.</div><div class="sentence"> Everything which is thus changing and moving is in process of generation; only when at rest has it real existence, but when passing into another state it is destroyed utterly.</div><div class="sentence"> Have we not mentioned all motions that there are, and comprehended them under their kinds and numbered them with the exception, my friends, of two?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Which are they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Just the two, with which our present enquiry is concerned.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Speak plainer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose that our enquiry has reference to the soul?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us assume that there is a motion able to move other things, but not to move itself; that is one kind; and there is another kind which can move itself as well as other things, working in composition and decomposition, by increase and diminution and generation and destruction—that is also one of the many kinds of motion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Granted.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And we will assume that which moves other, and is changed by other, to be the ninth, and that which changes itself and others, and is coincident with every action and every passion, and is the true principle of change and motion in all that is—that we shall be inclined to call the tenth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And which of these ten motions ought we to prefer as being the mightiest and most efficient?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I must say that the motion which is able to move itself is ten thousand times superior to all the others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Very good; but may I make one or two corrections in what I have been saying?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What are they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">074</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  When I spoke of the tenth sort of motion, that was not quite correct.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What was the error?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">076</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  According to the true order, the tenth was really the first in generation and power; then follows the second, which was strangely enough termed the ninth by us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">078</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I mean this:  when one thing changes another, and that another, of such will there be any primary changing element?</div><div class="sentence"> How can a thing which is moved by another ever be the beginning of change?</div><div class="sentence"> Impossible.</div><div class="sentence"> But when the self-moved changes other, and that again other, and thus thousands upon tens of thousands of bodies are set in motion, must not the beginning of all this motion be the change of the self-moving principle?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">079</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true, and I quite agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Or, to put the question in another way, making answer to ourselves:  If, as most of these philosophers have the audacity to affirm, all things were at rest in one mass, which of the above-mentioned principles of motion would first spring up among them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">081</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly the self-moving; for there could be no change in them arising out of any external cause; the change must first take place in themselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">082</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then we must say that self-motion being the origin of all motions, and the first which arises among things at rest as well as among things in motion, is the eldest and mightiest principle of change, and that which is changed by another and yet moves other is second.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">083</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">084</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  At this stage of the argument let us put a question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">085</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What question?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">086</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  If we were to see this power existing in any earthy, watery, or fiery substance, simple or compound—how should we describe it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  You mean to ask whether we should call such a self-moving power life?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">088</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly we should.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And when we see soul in anything, must we not do the same—must we not admit that this is life?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  We must.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And now, I beseech you, reflect—you would admit that we have a threefold knowledge of things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">093</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I mean that we know the essence, and that we know the definition of the essence, and the name—these are the three; and there are two questions which may be raised about anything.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  How two?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Sometimes a person may give the name and ask the definition; or he may give the definition and ask the name.</div><div class="sentence"> I may illustrate what I mean in this way.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  How?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">098</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Number like some other things is capable of being divided into equal parts; when thus divided, number is named 'even,' and the definition of the name 'even' is 'number divisible into two equal parts'?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">100</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I mean, that when we are asked about the definition and give the name, or when we are asked about the name and give the definition—in either case, whether we give name or definition, we speak of the same thing, calling 'even' the number which is divided into two equal parts.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And what is the definition of that which is named 'soul'?</div><div class="sentence"> Can we conceive of any other than that which has been already given—the motion which can move itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">103</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  You mean to say that the essence which is defined as the self-moved is the same with that which has the name soul?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; and if this is true, do we still maintain that there is anything wanting in the proof that the soul is the first origin and moving power of all that is, or has become, or will be, and their contraries, when she has been clearly shown to be the source of change and motion in all things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not; the soul as being the source of motion, has been most satisfactorily shown to be the oldest of all things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And is not that motion which is produced in another, by reason of another, but never has any self-moving power at all, being in truth the change of an inanimate body, to be reckoned second, or by any lower number which you may prefer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then we are right, and speak the most perfect and absolute truth, when we say that the soul is prior to the body, and that the body is second and comes afterwards, and is born to obey the soul, which is the ruler?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">109</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Nothing can be more true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Do you remember our old admission, that if the soul was prior to the body the things of the soul were also prior to those of the body?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">111</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">112</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then characters and manners, and wishes and reasonings, and true opinions, and reflections, and recollections are prior to length and breadth and depth and strength of bodies, if the soul is prior to the body.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">113</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">114</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  In the next place, we must not of necessity admit that the soul is the cause of good and evil, base and honourable, just and unjust, and of all other opposites, if we suppose her to be the cause of all things?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">118</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  One soul or more?</div><div class="sentence"> More than one—I will answer for you; at any rate, we must not suppose that there are less than two—one the author of good, and the other of evil.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">120</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, very true; the soul then directs all things in heaven, and earth, and sea by her movements, and these are described by the terms—will, consideration, attention, deliberation, opinion true and false, joy and sorrow, confidence, fear, hatred, love, and other primary motions akin to these; which again receive the secondary motions of corporeal substances, and guide all things to growth and decay, to composition and decomposition, and to the qualities which accompany them, such as heat and cold, heaviness and lightness, hardness and softness, blackness and whiteness, bitterness and sweetness, and all those other qualities which the soul uses, herself a goddess, when truly receiving the divine mind she disciplines all things rightly to their happiness; but when she is the companion of folly, she does the very contrary of all this.</div><div class="sentence"> Shall we assume so much, or do we still entertain doubts?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">123</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  How would you answer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">124</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  If, my friend, we say that the whole path and movement of heaven, and of all that is therein, is by nature akin to the movement and revolution and calculation of mind, and proceeds by kindred laws, then, as is plain, we must say that the best soul takes care of the world and guides it along the good path.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">125</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">126</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But if the world moves wildly and irregularly, then the evil soul guides it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">127</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True again.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">128</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Of what nature is the movement of mind?</div><div class="sentence"> To this question it is not easy to give an intelligent answer; and therefore I ought to assist you in framing one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">129</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">130</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then let us not answer as if we would look straight at the sun, making ourselves darkness at midday—I mean as if we were under the impression that we could see with mortal eyes, or know adequately the nature of mind—it will be safer to look at the image only.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">131</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">132</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us select of the ten motions the one which mind chiefly resembles; this I will bring to your recollection, and will then make the answer on behalf of us all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">133</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That will be excellent.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">134</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  You will surely remember our saying that all things were either at rest or in motion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">135</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">136</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And that of things in motion some were moving in one place, and others in more than one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">137</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">138</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Of these two kinds of motion, that which moves in one place must move about a centre like globes made in a lathe, and is most entirely akin and similar to the circular movement of mind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">139</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">140</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  In saying that both mind and the motion which is in one place move in the same and like manner, in and about the same, and in relation to the same, and according to one proportion and order, and are like the motion of a globe, we invented a fair image, which does no discredit to our ingenuity.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">141</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  It does us great credit.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">142</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And the motion of the other sort which is not after the same manner, nor in the same, nor about the same, nor in relation to the same, nor in one place, nor in order, nor according to any rule or proportion, may be said to be akin to senselessness and folly?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">143</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That is most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">144</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then, after what has been said, there is no difficulty in distinctly stating, that since soul carries all things round, either the best soul or the contrary must of necessity carry round and order and arrange the revolution of the heaven.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">145</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  And judging from what has been said, Stranger, there would be impiety in asserting that any but the most perfect soul or souls carries round the heavens.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">146</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  You have understood my meaning right well, Cleinias, and now let me ask you another question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">147</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What are you going to ask?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">148</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  If the soul carries round the sun and moon, and the other stars, does she not carry round each individual of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">149</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">150</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then of one of them let us speak, and the same argument will apply to all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">151</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Which will you take?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">152</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Every one sees the body of the sun, but no one sees his soul, nor the soul of any other body living or dead; and yet there is great reason to believe that this nature, unperceived by any of our senses, is circumfused around them all, but is perceived by mind; and therefore by mind and reflection only let us apprehend the following point.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">153</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">154</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  If the soul carries round the sun, we shall not be far wrong in supposing one of three alternatives.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">155</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What are they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">156</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Either the soul which moves the sun this way and that, resides within the circular and visible body, like the soul which carries us about every way; or the soul provides herself with an external body of fire or air, as some affirm, and violently propels body by body; or thirdly, she is without such a body, but guides the sun by some extraordinary and wonderful power.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">157</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, certainly; the soul can only order all things in one of these three ways.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">158</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And this soul of the sun, which is therefore better than the sun, whether taking the sun about in a chariot to give light to men, or acting from without, or in whatever way, ought by every man to be deemed a God.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">159</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, by every man who has the least particle of sense.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">160</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And of the stars too, and of the moon, and of the years and months and seasons, must we not say in like manner, that since a soul or souls having every sort of excellence are the causes of all of them, those souls are Gods, whether they are living beings and reside in bodies, and in this way order the whole heaven, or whatever be the place and mode of their existence—and will any one who admits all this venture to deny that all things are full of Gods?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">161</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  No one, Stranger, would be such a madman.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">162</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And now, Megillus and Cleinias, let us offer terms to him who has hitherto denied the existence of the Gods, and leave him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">163</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What terms?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">164</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Either he shall teach us that we were wrong in saying that the soul is the original of all things, and arguing accordingly; or, if he be not able to say anything better, then he must yield to us and live for the remainder of his life in the belief that there are Gods.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us see, then, whether we have said enough or not enough to those who deny that there are Gods.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">165</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly, quite enough, Stranger.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">166</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then to them we will say no more.</div><div class="sentence"> And now we are to address him who, believing that there are Gods, believes also that they take no heed of human affairs:  To him we say—O thou best of men, in believing that there are Gods you are led by some affinity to them, which attracts you towards your kindred and makes you honour and believe in them.</div><div class="sentence"> But the fortunes of evil and unrighteous men in private as well as public life, which, though not really happy, are wrongly counted happy in the judgment of men, and are celebrated both by poets and prose writers—these draw you aside from your natural piety.</div><div class="sentence"> Perhaps you have seen impious men growing old and leaving their children's children in high offices, and their prosperity shakes your faith—you have known or heard or been yourself an eyewitness of many monstrous impieties, and have beheld men by such criminal means from small beginnings attaining to sovereignty and the pinnacle of greatness; and considering all these things you do not like to accuse the Gods of them, because they are your relatives; and so from some want of reasoning power, and also from an unwillingness to find fault with them, you have come to believe that they exist indeed, but have no thought or care of human things.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, that your present evil opinion may not grow to still greater impiety, and that we may if possible use arguments which may conjure away the evil before it arrives, we will add another argument to that originally addressed to him who utterly denied the existence of the Gods.</div><div class="sentence"> And do you, Megillus and Cleinias, answer for the young man as you did before; and if any impediment comes in our way, I will take the word out of your mouths, and carry you over the river as I did just now.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">167</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good; do as you say, and we will help you as well as we can.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">168</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  There will probably be no difficulty in proving to him that the Gods care about the small as well as about the great.</div><div class="sentence"> For he was present and heard what was said, that they are perfectly good, and that the care of all things is most entirely natural to them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">169</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  No doubt he heard that.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">170</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us consider together in the next place what we mean by this virtue which we ascribe to them.</div><div class="sentence"> Surely we should say that to be temperate and to possess mind belongs to virtue, and the contrary to vice?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">171</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">172</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; and courage is a part of virtue, and cowardice of vice?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">173</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">174</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And the one is honourable, and the other dishonourable?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">175</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">176</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And the one, like other meaner things, is a human quality, but the Gods have no part in anything of the sort?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">177</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That again is what everybody will admit.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">178</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But do we imagine carelessness and idleness and luxury to be virtues?</div><div class="sentence"> What do you think?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">179</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Decidedly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">180</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  They rank under the opposite class?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">181</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">182</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And their opposites, therefore, would fall under the opposite class?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">183</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">184</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But are we to suppose that one who possesses all these good qualities will be luxurious and heedless and idle, like those whom the poet compares to stingless drones?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">185</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  And the comparison is a most just one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">186</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Surely God must not be supposed to have a nature which He Himself hates?</div><div class="sentence"> he who dares to say this sort of thing must not be tolerated for a moment.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">187</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course not.</div><div class="sentence"> How could he have?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">188</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Should we not on any principle be entirely mistaken in praising any one who has some special business entrusted to him, if he have a mind which takes care of great matters and no care of small ones?</div><div class="sentence"> Reflect; he who acts in this way, whether he be God or man, must act from one of two principles.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">189</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What are they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">190</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Either he must think that the neglect of the small matters is of no consequence to the whole, or if he knows that they are of consequence, and he neglects them, his neglect must be attributed to carelessness and indolence.</div><div class="sentence"> Is there any other way in which his neglect can be explained?</div><div class="sentence"> For surely, when it is impossible for him to take care of all, he is not negligent if he fails to attend to these things great or small, which a God or some inferior being might be wanting in strength or capacity to manage?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">191</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">192</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Now, then, let us examine the offenders, who both alike confess that there are Gods, but with a difference—the one saying that they may be appeased, and the other that they have no care of small matters:  there are three of us and two of them, and we will say to them—In the first place, you both acknowledge that the Gods hear and see and know all things, and that nothing can escape them which is matter of sense and knowledge:  do you admit this?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">193</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">194</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And do you admit also that they have all power which mortals and immortals can have?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">195</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  They will, of course, admit this also.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">196</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And surely we three and they two—five in all—have acknowledged that they are good and perfect?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">197</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Assuredly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">198</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  But, if they are such as we conceive them to be, can we possibly suppose that they ever act in the spirit of carelessness and indolence?</div><div class="sentence"> For in us inactivity is the child of cowardice, and carelessness of inactivity and indolence.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">199</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">200</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then not from inactivity and carelessness is any God ever negligent; for there is no cowardice in them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">201</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That is very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">202</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then the alternative which remains is, that if the Gods neglect the lighter and lesser concerns of the universe, they neglect them because they know that they ought not to care about such matters—what other alternative is there but the opposite of their knowing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">203</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  There is none.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">204</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And, O most excellent and best of men, do I understand you to mean that they are careless because they are ignorant, and do not know that they ought to take care, or that they know, and yet like the meanest sort of men, knowing the better, choose the worse because they are overcome by pleasures and pains?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">205</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">206</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Do not all human things partake of the nature of soul?</div><div class="sentence"> And is not man the most religious of all animals?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">207</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That is not to be denied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">208</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And we acknowledge that all mortal creatures are the property of the Gods, to whom also the whole of heaven belongs?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">209</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">210</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And, therefore, whether a person says that these things are to the Gods great or small—in either case it would not be natural for the Gods who own us, and who are the most careful and the best of owners, to neglect us.</div><div class="sentence"> There is also a further consideration.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">211</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">212</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Sensation and power are in an inverse ratio to each other in respect to their ease and difficulty.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">213</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">214</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I mean that there is greater difficulty in seeing and hearing the small than the great, but more facility in moving and controlling and taking care of small and unimportant things than of their opposites.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">215</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Far more.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">216</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Suppose the case of a physician who is willing and able to cure some living thing as a whole—how will the whole fare at his hands if he takes care only of the greater and neglects the parts which are lesser?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">217</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Decidedly not well.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">218</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  No better would be the result with pilots or generals, or householders or statesmen, or any other such class, if they neglected the small and regarded only the great—as the builders say, the larger stones do not lie well without the lesser.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">219</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">220</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us not, then, deem God inferior to human workmen, who, in proportion to their skill, finish and perfect their works, small as well as great, by one and the same art; or that God, the wisest of beings, who is both willing and able to take care, is like a lazy good-for-nothing, or a coward, who turns his back upon labour and gives no thought to smaller and easier matters, but to the greater only.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">221</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Never, Stranger, let us admit a supposition about the Gods which is both impious and false.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">222</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I think that we have now argued enough with him who delights to accuse the Gods of neglect.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">223</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">224</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  He has been forced to acknowledge that he is in error, but he still seems to me to need some words of consolation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">225</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What consolation will you offer him?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">226</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us say to the youth:  The ruler of the universe has ordered all things with a view to the excellence and preservation of the whole, and each part, as far as may be, has an action and passion appropriate to it.</div><div class="sentence"> Over these, down to the least fraction of them, ministers have been appointed to preside, who have wrought out their perfection with infinitesimal exactness.</div><div class="sentence"> And one of these portions of the universe is thine own, unhappy man, which, however little, contributes to the whole; and you do not seem to be aware that this and every other creation is for the sake of the whole, and in order that the life of the whole may be blessed; and that you are created for the sake of the whole, and not the whole for the sake of you.</div><div class="sentence"> For every physician and every skilled artist does all things for the sake of the whole, directing his effort towards the common good, executing the part for the sake of the whole, and not the whole for the sake of the part.</div><div class="sentence"> And you are annoyed because you are ignorant how what is best for you happens to you and to the universe, as far as the laws of the common creation admit.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, as the soul combining first with one body and then with another undergoes all sorts of changes, either of herself, or through the influence of another soul, all that remains to the player of the game is that he should shift the pieces; sending the better nature to the better place, and the worse to the worse, and so assigning to them their proper portion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">227</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  In what way do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">228</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  In a way which may be supposed to make the care of all things easy to the Gods.</div><div class="sentence"> If any one were to form or fashion all things without any regard to the whole—if, for example, he formed a living element of water out of fire, instead of forming many things out of one or one out of many in regular order attaining to a first or second or third birth, the transmutation would have been infinite; but now the ruler of the world has a wonderfully easy task.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">229</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">230</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I will explain:  When the king saw that our actions had life, and that there was much virtue in them and much vice, and that the soul and body, although not, like the Gods of popular opinion, eternal, yet having once come into existence, were indestructible (for if either of them had been destroyed, there would have been no generation of living beings); and when he observed that the good of the soul was ever by nature designed to profit men, and the evil to harm them—he, seeing all this, contrived so to place each of the parts that their position might in the easiest and best manner procure the victory of good and the defeat of evil in the whole.</div><div class="sentence"> And he contrived a general plan by which a thing of a certain nature found a certain seat and room.</div><div class="sentence"> But the formation of qualities he left to the wills of individuals.</div><div class="sentence"> For every one of us is made pretty much what he is by the bent of his desires and the nature of his soul.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">255</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  So let us hope; and even if we have failed, the style of our argument will not discredit the lawgiver.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">256</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  After the prelude shall follow a discourse, which will be the interpreter of the law; this shall proclaim to all impious persons that they must depart from their ways and go over to the pious.</div><div class="sentence"> And to those who disobey, let the law about impiety be as follows:  If a man is guilty of any impiety in word or deed, any one who happens to be present shall give information to the magistrates, in aid of the law; and let the magistrates who first receive the information bring him before the appointed court according to the law; and if a magistrate, after receiving information, refuses to act, he shall be tried for impiety at the instance of any one who is willing to vindicate the laws; and if any one be cast, the court shall estimate the punishment of each act of impiety; and let all such criminals be imprisoned.</div><div class="sentence"> There shall be three prisons in the state:  the first of them is to be the common prison in the neighbourhood of the agora for the safe-keeping of the generality of offenders; another is to be in the neighbourhood of the nocturnal council, and is to be called the 'House of Reformation'; another, to be situated in some wild and desolate region in the centre of the country, shall be called by some name expressive of retribution.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, men fall into impiety from three causes, which have been already mentioned, and from each of these causes arise two sorts of impiety, in all six, which are worth distinguishing, and should not all have the same punishment.</div><div class="sentence"> For he who does not believe in the Gods, and yet has a righteous nature, hates the wicked and dislikes and refuses to do injustice, and avoids unrighteous men, and loves the righteous.</div><div class="sentence"> But they who besides believing that the world is devoid of Gods are intemperate, and have at the same time good memories and quick wits, are worse; although both of them are unbelievers, much less injury is done by the one than by the other.</div><div class="sentence"> The one may talk loosely about the Gods and about sacrifices and oaths, and perhaps by laughing at other men he may make them like himself, if he be not punished.</div><div class="sentence"> But the other who holds the same opinions and is called a clever man, is full of stratagem and deceit—men of this class deal in prophecy and jugglery of all kinds, and out of their ranks sometimes come tyrants and demagogues and generals and hierophants of private mysteries and the Sophists, as they are termed, with their ingenious devices.</div><div class="sentence"> There are many kinds of unbelievers, but two only for whom legislation is required; one the hypocritical sort, whose crime is deserving of death many times over, while the other needs only bonds and admonition.</div><div class="sentence"> In like manner also the notion that the Gods take no thought of men produces two other sorts of crimes, and the notion that they may be propitiated produces two more.</div><div class="sentence"> Assuming these divisions, let those who have been made what they are only from want of understanding, and not from malice or an evil nature, be placed by the judge in the House of Reformation, and ordered to suffer imprisonment during a period of not less than five years.</div><div class="sentence"> And in the meantime let them have no intercourse with the other citizens, except with members of the nocturnal council, and with them let them converse with a view to the improvement of their soul's health.</div><div class="sentence"> And when the time of their imprisonment has expired, if any of them be of sound mind let him be restored to sane company, but if not, and if he be condemned a second time, let him be punished with death.</div><div class="sentence"> As to that class of monstrous natures who not only believe that there are no Gods, or that they are negligent, or to be propitiated, but in contempt of mankind conjure the souls of the living and say that they can conjure the dead and promise to charm the Gods with sacrifices and prayers, and will utterly overthrow individuals and whole houses and states for the sake of money—let him who is guilty of any of these things be condemned by the court to be bound according to law in the prison which is in the centre of the land, and let no freeman ever approach him, but let him receive the rations of food appointed by the guardians of the law from the hands of the public slaves; and when he is dead let him be cast beyond the borders unburied, and if any freeman assist in burying him, let him pay the penalty of impiety to any one who is willing to bring a suit against him.</div><div class="sentence"> But if he leaves behind him children who are fit to be citizens, let the guardians of orphans take care of them, just as they would of any other orphans, from the day on which their father is convicted.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">257</span> <div class="sentence">  In all these cases there should be one law, which will make men in general less liable to transgress in word or deed, and less foolish, because they will not be allowed to practise religious rites contrary to law.</div><div class="sentence"> And let this be the simple form of the law: No man shall have sacred rites in a private house.</div><div class="sentence"> When he would sacrifice, let him go to the temples and hand over his offerings to the priests and priestesses, who see to the sanctity of such things, and let him pray himself, and let any one who pleases join with him in prayer.</div><div class="sentence"> The reason of this is as follows: Gods and temples are not easily instituted, and to establish them rightly is the work of a mighty intellect.</div><div class="sentence"> And women especially, and men too, when they are sick or in danger, or in any sort of difficulty, or again on their receiving any good fortune, have a way of consecrating the occasion, vowing sacrifices, and promising shrines to Gods, demigods, and sons of Gods; and when they are awakened by terrible apparitions and dreams or remember visions, they find in altars and temples the remedies of them, and will fill every house and village with them, placing them in the open air, or wherever they may have had such visions; and with a view to all these cases we should obey the law.</div><div class="sentence"> The law has also regard to the impious, and would not have them fancy that by the secret performance of these actions—by raising temples and by building altars in private houses, they can propitiate the God secretly with sacrifices and prayers, while they are really multiplying their crimes infinitely, bringing guilt from heaven upon themselves, and also upon those who permit them, and who are better men than they are; and the consequence is that the whole state reaps the fruit of their impiety, which, in a certain sense, is deserved.</div><div class="sentence"> Assuredly God will not blame the legislator, who will enact the following law: No one shall possess shrines of the Gods in private houses, and he who is found to possess them, and perform any sacred rites not publicly authorised—supposing the offender to be some man or woman who is not guilty of any other great and impious crime—shall be informed against by him who is acquainted with the fact, which shall be announced by him to the guardians of the law; and let them issue orders that he or she shall carry away their private rites to the public temples, and if they do not persuade them, let them inflict a penalty on them until they comply.</div><div class="sentence"> And if a person be proven guilty of impiety, not merely from childish levity, but such as grown-up men may be guilty of, whether he have sacrificed publicly or privately to any Gods, let him be punished with death, for his sacrifice is impure.</div><div class="sentence"> Whether the deed has been done in earnest, or only from childish levity, let the guardians of the law determine, before they bring the matter into court and prosecute the offender for impiety.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  In the next place, dealings between man and man require to be suitably regulated.</div><div class="sentence"> The principle of them is very simple: Thou shalt not, if thou canst help, touch that which is mine, or remove the least thing which belongs to me without my consent; and may I be of a sound mind, and do to others as I would that they should do to me.</div><div class="sentence"> First, let us speak of treasure-trove: May I never pray the Gods to find the hidden treasure, which another has laid up for himself and his family, he not being one of my ancestors, nor lift, if I should find, such a treasure.</div><div class="sentence"> And may I never have any dealings with those who are called diviners, and who in any way or manner counsel me to take up the deposit entrusted to the earth, for I should not gain so much in the increase of my possessions, if I take up the prize, as I should grow in justice and virtue of soul, if I abstain; and this will be a better possession to me than the other in a better part of myself; for the possession of justice in the soul is preferable to the possession of wealth.</div><div class="sentence"> And of many things it is well said—'Move not the immovables,' and this may be regarded as one of them.</div><div class="sentence"> And we shall do well to believe the common tradition which says, that such deeds prevent a man from having a family.</div><div class="sentence"> Now as to him who is careless about having children and regardless of the legislator, taking up that which neither he deposited, nor any ancestor of his, without the consent of the depositor, violating the simplest and noblest of laws which was the enactment of no mean man: 'Take not up that which was not laid down by thee'—of him, I say, who despises these two legislators, and takes up, not some small matter which he has not deposited, but perhaps a great heap of treasure, what he ought to suffer at the hands of the Gods, God only knows; but I would have the first person who sees him go and tell the wardens of the city, if the occurrence has taken place in the city, or if the occurrence has taken place in the agora he shall tell the wardens of the agora, or if in the country he shall tell the wardens of the country and their commanders.</div><div class="sentence"> When information has been received the city shall send to Delphi, and, whatever the God answers about the money and the remover of the money, that the city shall do in obedience to the oracle; the informer, if he be a freeman, shall have the honour of doing rightly, and he who informs not, the dishonour of doing wrongly; and if he be a slave who gives information, let him be freed, as he ought to be, by the state, which shall give his master the price of him; but if he do not inform he shall be punished with death.</div><div class="sentence"> Next in order shall follow a similar law, which shall apply equally to matters great and small: If a man happens to leave behind him some part of his property, whether intentionally or unintentionally, let him who may come upon the left property suffer it to remain, reflecting that such things are under the protection of the Goddess of ways, and are dedicated to her by the law.</div><div class="sentence"> But if any one defies the law, and takes the property home with him, let him, if the thing is of little worth, and the man who takes it a slave, be beaten with many stripes by him who meets him, being a person of not less than thirty years of age.</div><div class="sentence"> Or if he be a freeman, in addition to being thought a mean person and a despiser of the laws, let him pay ten times the value of the treasure which he has moved to the leaver.</div><div class="sentence"> And if some one accuses another of having anything which belongs to him, whether little or much, and the other admits that he has this thing, but denies that the property in dispute belongs to the other, if the property be registered with the magistrates according to law, the claimant shall summon the possessor, who shall bring it before the magistrates; and when it is brought into court, if it be registered in the public registers, to which of the litigants it belonged, let him take it and go his way.</div><div class="sentence"> Or if the property be registered as belonging to some one who is not present, whoever will offer sufficient surety on behalf of the absent person that he will give it up to him, shall take it away as the representative of the other.</div><div class="sentence"> But if the property which is deposited be not registered with the magistrates, let it remain until the time of trial with three of the eldest of the magistrates; and if it be an animal which is deposited, then he who loses the suit shall pay the magistrates for its keep, and they shall determine the cause within three days.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Any one who is of sound mind may arrest his own slave, and do with him whatever he will of such things as are lawful; and he may arrest the runaway slave of any of his friends or kindred with a view to his safe-keeping.</div><div class="sentence"> And if any one takes away him who is being carried off as a slave, intending to liberate him, he who is carrying him off shall let him go; but he who takes him away shall give three sufficient sureties; and if he give them, and not without giving them, he may take him away, but if he take him away after any other manner he shall be deemed guilty of violence, and being convicted shall pay as a penalty double the amount of the damages claimed to him who has been deprived of the slave.</div><div class="sentence"> Any man may also carry off a freedman, if he do not pay respect or sufficient respect to him who freed him.</div><div class="sentence"> Now the respect shall be, that the freedman go three times in the month to the hearth of the person who freed him, and offer to do whatever he ought, so far as he can; and he shall agree to make such a marriage as his former master approves.</div><div class="sentence"> He shall not be permitted to have more property than he who gave him liberty, and what more he has shall belong to his master.</div><div class="sentence"> The freedman shall not remain in the state more than twenty years, but like other foreigners shall go away, taking his entire property with him, unless he has the consent of the magistrates and of his former master to remain.</div><div class="sentence"> If a freedman or any other stranger has a property greater than the census of the third class, at the expiration of thirty days from the day on which this comes to pass, he shall take that which is his and go his way, and in this case he shall not be allowed to remain any longer by the magistrates.</div><div class="sentence"> And if any one disobeys this regulation, and is brought into court and convicted, he shall be punished with death, and his property shall be confiscated.</div><div class="sentence"> Suits about these matters shall take place before the tribes, unless the plaintiff and defendant have got rid of the accusation either before their neighbours or before judges chosen by them.</div><div class="sentence"> If a man lay claim to any animal or anything else which he declares to be his, let the possessor refer to the seller or to some honest and trustworthy person, who has given, or in some legitimate way made over the property to him; if he be a citizen or a metic, sojourning in the city, within thirty days, or, if the property have been delivered to him by a stranger, within five months, of which the middle month shall include the summer solstice.</div><div class="sentence"> When goods are exchanged by selling and buying, a man shall deliver them, and receive the price of them, at a fixed place in the agora, and have done with the matter; but he shall not buy or sell anywhere else, nor give credit.</div><div class="sentence"> And if in any other manner or in any other place there be an exchange of one thing for another, and the seller give credit to the man who buys from him, he must do this on the understanding that the law gives no protection in cases of things sold not in accordance with these regulations.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, as to contributions, any man who likes may go about collecting contributions as a friend among friends, but if any difference arises about the collection, he is to act on the understanding that the law gives no protection in such cases.</div><div class="sentence"> He who sells anything above the value of fifty drachmas shall be required to remain in the city for ten days, and the purchaser shall be informed of the house of the seller, with a view to the sort of charges which are apt to arise in such cases, and the restitutions which the law allows.</div><div class="sentence"> And let legal restitution be on this wise: If a man sells a slave who is in a consumption, or who has the disease of the stone, or of strangury, or epilepsy, or some other tedious and incurable disorder of body or mind, which is not discernible to the ordinary man, if the purchaser be a physician or trainer, he shall have no right of restitution; nor shall there be any right of restitution if the seller has told the truth beforehand to the buyer.</div><div class="sentence"> But if a skilled person sells to another who is not skilled, let the buyer appeal for restitution within six months, except in the case of epilepsy, and then the appeal may be made within a year.</div><div class="sentence"> The cause shall be determined by such physicians as the parties may agree to choose; and the defendant, if he lose the suit, shall pay double the price at which he sold.</div><div class="sentence"> If a private person sell to another private person, he shall have the right of restitution, and the decision shall be given as before, but the defendant, if he be cast, shall only pay back the price of the slave.</div><div class="sentence"> If a person sells a homicide to another, and they both know of the fact, let there be no restitution in such a case, but if he do not know of the fact, there shall be a right of restitution, whenever the buyer makes the discovery;

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  O my friends, we will say to them, hard is it for you, who are creatures of a day, to know what is yours—hard too, as the Delphic oracle says, to know yourselves at this hour.</div><div class="sentence"> Now I, as the legislator, regard you and your possessions, not as belonging to yourselves, but as belonging to your whole family, both past and future, and yet more do I regard both family and possessions as belonging to the state; wherefore, if some one steals upon you with flattery, when you are tossed on the sea of disease or old age, and persuades you to dispose of your property in a way that is not for the best, I will not, if I can help, allow this; but I will legislate with a view to the whole, considering what is best both for the state and for the family, esteeming as I ought the feelings of an individual at a lower rate; and I hope that you will depart in peace and kindness towards us, as you are going the way of all mankind; and we will impartially take care of all your concerns, not neglecting any of them, if we can possibly help.</div><div class="sentence"> Let this be our prelude and consolation to the living and dying, Cleinias, and let the law be as follows:  He who makes a disposition in a testament, if he be the father of a family, shall first of all inscribe as his heir any one of his sons whom he may think fit; and if he gives any of his children to be adopted by another citizen, let the adoption be inscribed.</div><div class="sentence"> And if he has a son remaining over and above who has not been adopted upon any lot, and who may be expected to be sent out to a colony according to law, to him his father may give as much as he pleases of the rest of his property, with the exception of the paternal lot and the fixtures on the lot.</div><div class="sentence"> And if there are other sons, let him distribute among them what there is more than the lot in such portions as he pleases.</div><div class="sentence"> And if one of the sons has already a house of his own, he shall not give him of the money, nor shall he give money to a daughter who has been betrothed, but if she is not betrothed he may give her money.</div><div class="sentence"> And if any of the sons or daughters shall be found to have another lot of land in the country, which has accrued after the testament has been made, they shall leave the lot which they have inherited to the heir of the man who has made the will.</div><div class="sentence"> If the testator has no sons, but only daughters, let him choose the husband of any one of his daughters whom he pleases, and leave and inscribe him as his son and heir.</div><div class="sentence"> And if a man have lost his son, when he was a child, and before he could be reckoned among grown up men, whether his own or an adopted son, let the testator make mention of the circumstance and inscribe whom he will to be his second son in hope of better fortune.</div><div class="sentence"> If the testator has no children at all, he may select and give to any one whom he pleases the tenth part of the property which he has acquired; but let him not be blamed if he gives all the rest to his adopted son, and makes a friend of him according to the law.</div><div class="sentence"> If the sons of a man require guardians, and the father when he dies leaves a will appointing guardians, those who have been named by him, whoever they are and whatever their number be, if they are able and willing to take charge of the children, shall be recognised according to the provisions of the will.</div><div class="sentence"> But if he dies and has made no will, or a will in which he has appointed no guardians, then the next of kin, two on the father's and two on the mother's side, and one of the friends of the deceased, shall have the authority of guardians, whom the guardians of the law shall appoint when the orphans require guardians.</div><div class="sentence"> And the fifteen eldest guardians of the law shall have the whole care and charge of the orphans, divided into threes according to seniority—a body of three for one year, and then another body of three for the next year, until the cycle of the five periods is complete; and this, as far as possible, is to continue always.</div><div class="sentence"> If a man dies, having made no will at all, and leaves sons who require the care of guardians, they shall share in the protection which is afforded by these laws.</div><div class="sentence"> And if a man dying by some unexpected fate leaves daughters behind him, let him pardon the legislator if when he gives them in marriage, he have a regard only to two out of three conditions—nearness of kin and the preservation of the lot, and omits the third condition, which a father would naturally consider, for he would choose out of all the citizens a son for himself, and a husband for his daughter, with a view to his character and disposition—the father, I say, shall forgive the legislator if he disregards this, which to him is an impossible consideration.</div><div class="sentence"> Let the law about these matters where practicable be as follows:  If a man dies without making a will, and leaves behind him daughters, let his brother, being the son of the same father or of the same mother, having no lot, marry the daughter and have the lot of the dead man.</div><div class="sentence"> And if he have no brother, but only a brother's son, in like manner let them marry, if they be of a suitable age; and if there be not even a brother's son, but only the son of a sister, let them do likewise, and so in the fourth degree, if there be only the testator's father's brother, or in the fifth degree, his father's brother's son, or in the sixth degree, the child of his father's sister.</div><div class="sentence"> Let kindred be always reckoned in this way:  if a person leaves daughters the relationship shall proceed upwards through brothers and sisters, and brothers' and sisters' children, and first the males shall come, and after them the females in the same family.</div><div class="sentence"> The judge shall consider and determine the suitableness or unsuitableness of age in marriage; he shall make an inspection of the males naked, and of the women naked down to the navel.</div><div class="sentence"> And if there be a lack of kinsmen in a family extending to grandchildren of a brother, or to the grandchildren of a grandfather's children, the maiden may choose with the consent of her guardians any one of the citizens who is willing and whom she wills, and he shall be the heir of the dead man, and the husband of his daughter.</div><div class="sentence"> Circumstances vary, and there may sometimes be a still greater lack of relations within the limits of the state; and if any maiden has no kindred living in the city, and there is some one who has been sent out to a colony, and she is disposed to make him the heir of her father's possessions, if he be indeed of her kindred, let him proceed to take the lot according to the regulation of the law; but if he be not of her kindred, she having no kinsmen within the city, and he be chosen by the daughter of the dead man, and empowered to marry by the guardians, let him return home and take the lot of him who died intestate.</div><div class="sentence"> And if a man has no children, either male or female, and dies without making a will, let the previous law in general hold; and let a man and a woman go forth from the family and share the deserted house, and let the lot belong absolutely to them; and let the heiress in the first degree be a sister, and in a second degree a daughter of a brother, and in the third, a daughter of a sister, in the fourth degree the sister of a father, and in the fifth degree the daughter of a father's brother, and in a sixth degree of a father's sister; and these shall dwell with their male kinsmen, according to the degree of relationship and right, as we enacted before.</div><div class="sentence"> Now we must not conceal from ourselves that such laws are apt to be oppressive and that there may sometimes be a hardship in the lawgiver commanding the kinsman of the dead man to marry his relation; he may be thought not to have considered the innumerable hindrances which may arise among men in the execution of such ordinances; for there may be cases in which the parties refuse to obey, and are ready to do anything rather than marry, when there is some bodily or mental malady or defect among those who are bidden to marry or be married.</div><div class="sentence"> Persons may fancy that the legislator never thought of this, but they are mistaken; wherefore let us make a common prelude on behalf of the lawgiver and of his subjects, the law begging the latter to forgive the legislator, in that he, having to take care of the common weal, cannot order at the same time the various circumstances of individuals, and begging him to pardon them if naturally they are sometimes unable to fulfil the act which he in his ignorance imposes upon them.</div></div>

wherever a city is well ordered and prosperous, their descendants cherish them, and so live happily; old persons are quick to see and hear all that relates to them, and are propitious to those who are just in the fulfilment of such duties, and they punish those who wrong the orphan and the desolate, considering that they are the greatest and most sacred of trusts.</div><div class="sentence"> To all which matters the guardian and magistrate ought to apply his mind, if he has any, and take heed of the nurture and education of the orphans, seeking in every possible way to do them good, for he is making a contribution to his own good and that of his children.</div><div class="sentence"> He who obeys the tale which precedes the law, and does no wrong to an orphan, will never experience the wrath of the legislator.</div><div class="sentence"> But he who is disobedient, and wrongs any one who is bereft of father or mother, shall pay twice the penalty which he would have paid if he had wronged one whose parents had been alive.</div><div class="sentence"> As touching other legislation concerning guardians in their relation to orphans, or concerning magistrates and their superintendence of the guardians, if they did not possess examples of the manner in which children of freemen would be brought up in the bringing up of their own children, and of the care of their property in the care of their own, or if they had not just laws fairly stated about these very things—there would have been reason in making laws for them, under the idea that they were a peculiar class, and we might distinguish and make separate rules for the life of those who are orphans and of those who are not orphans.</div><div class="sentence"> But as the case stands, the condition of orphans with us is not different from the case of those who have a father, though in regard to honour and dishonour, and the attention given to them, the two are not usually placed upon a level.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore, touching the legislation about orphans, the law speaks in serious accents, both of persuasion and threatening, and such a threat as the following will be by no means out of place: He who is the guardian of an orphan of either sex, and he among the guardians of the law to whom the superintendence of this guardian has been assigned, shall love the unfortunate orphan as though he were his own child, and he shall be as careful and diligent in the management of his possessions as he would be if they were his own, or even more careful and diligent.</div><div class="sentence"> Let every one who has the care of an orphan observe this law.</div><div class="sentence"> But any one who acts contrary to the law on these matters, if he be a guardian of the child, may be fined by a magistrate, or, if he be himself a magistrate, the guardian may bring him before the court of select judges, and punish him, if convicted, by exacting a fine of double the amount of that inflicted by the court.</div><div class="sentence"> And if a guardian appears to the relations of the orphan, or to any other citizen, to act negligently or dishonestly, let them bring him before the same court, and whatever damages are given against him, let him pay fourfold, and let half belong to the orphan and half to him who procured the conviction.</div><div class="sentence"> If any orphan arrives at years of discretion, and thinks that he has been ill-used by his guardians, let him within five years of the expiration of the guardianship be allowed to bring them to trial; and if any of them be convicted, the court shall determine what he shall pay or suffer.</div><div class="sentence"> And if a magistrate shall appear to have wronged the orphan by neglect, and he be convicted, let the court determine what he shall suffer or pay to the orphan, and if there be dishonesty in addition to neglect, besides paying the fine, let him be deposed from his office of guardian of the law, and let the state appoint another guardian of the law for the city and for the country in his room.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span> <div class="sentence">  Greater differences than there ought to be sometimes arise between fathers and sons, on the part either of fathers who will be of opinion that the legislator should enact that they may, if they wish, lawfully renounce their son by the proclamation of a herald in the face of the world, or of sons who think that they should be allowed to indict their fathers on the charge of imbecility when they are disabled by disease or old age.</div><div class="sentence"> These things only happen, as a matter of fact, where the natures of men are utterly bad; for where only half is bad, as, for example, if the father be not bad, but the son be bad, or conversely, no great calamity is the result of such an amount of hatred as this.</div><div class="sentence"> In another state, a son disowned by his father would not of necessity cease to be a citizen, but in our state, of which these are to be the laws, the disinherited must necessarily emigrate into another country, for no addition can be made even of a single family to the 5040 households; and, therefore, he who deserves to suffer these things must be renounced not only by his father, who is a single person, but by the whole family, and what is done in these cases must be regulated by some such law as the following: He who in the sad disorder of his soul has a mind, justly or unjustly, to expel from his family a son whom he has begotten and brought up, shall not lightly or at once execute his purpose; but first of all he shall collect together his own kinsmen, extending to cousins, and in like manner his son's kinsmen by the mother's side, and in their presence he shall accuse his son, setting forth that he deserves at the hands of them all to be dismissed from the family; and the son shall be allowed to address them in a similar manner, and show that he does not deserve to suffer any of these things.</div><div class="sentence"> And if the father persuades them, and obtains the suffrages of more than half of his kindred, exclusive of the father and mother and the offender himself—I say, if he obtains more than half the suffrages of all the other grown-up members of the family, of both sexes, the father shall be permitted to put away his son, but not otherwise.</div><div class="sentence"> And if any other citizen is willing to adopt the son who is put away, no law shall hinder him; for the characters of young men are subject to many changes in the course of their lives.</div><div class="sentence"> And if he has been put away, and in a period of ten years no one is willing to adopt him, let those who have the care of the superabundant population which is sent out into colonies, see to him, in order that he may be suitably provided for in the colony.</div><div class="sentence"> And if disease or age or harshness of temper, or all these together, makes a man to be more out of his mind than the rest of the world are—but this is not observable, except to those who live with him—and he, being master of his property, is the ruin of the house, and his son doubts and hesitates about indicting his father for insanity, let the law in that case ordain that he shall first of all go to the eldest guardians of the law and tell them of his father's misfortune, and they shall duly look into the matter, and take counsel as to whether he shall indict him or not.</div><div class="sentence"> And if they advise him to proceed, they shall be both his witnesses and his advocates; and if the father is cast, he shall henceforth be incapable of ordering the least particular of his life; let him be as a child dwelling in the house for the remainder of his days.</div><div class="sentence"> And if a man and his wife have an unfortunate incompatibility of temper, ten of the guardians of the law, who are impartial, and ten of the women who regulate marriages, shall look to the matter, and if they are able to reconcile them they shall be formally reconciled; but if their souls are too much tossed with passion, they shall endeavour to find other partners.</div><div class="sentence"> Now they are not likely to have very gentle tempers; and, therefore, we must endeavour to associate with them deeper and softer natures.</div><div class="sentence"> Those who have no children, or only a few, at the time of their separation, should choose their new partners with a view to the procreation of children; but those who have a sufficient number of children should separate and marry again in order that they may have some one to grow old with and that the pair may take care of one another in age.</div><div class="sentence"> If a woman dies, leaving children, male or female, the law will advise rather than compel the husband to bring up the children without introducing into the house a stepmother.</div><div class="sentence"> But if he have no children, then he shall be compelled to marry until he has begotten a sufficient number of sons to his family and to the state.</div><div class="sentence"> And if a man dies leaving a sufficient number of children, the mother of his children shall remain with them and bring them up.</div><div class="sentence"> But if she appears to be too young to live virtuously without a husband, let her relations communicate with the women who superintend marriage, and let both together do what they think best in these matters; if there is a lack of children, let the choice be made with a view to having them; two children, one of either sex, shall be deemed sufficient in the eye of the law.</div><div class="sentence"> When a child is admitted to be the offspring of certain parents and is acknowledged by them, but there is need of a decision as to which parent the child is to follow—in case a female slave have intercourse with a male slave, or with a freeman or freedman, the offspring shall always belong to the master of the female slave.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, if a free woman have intercourse with a male slave, the offspring shall belong to the master of the slave; but if a child be born either of a slave by her master, or of his mistress by a slave—and this be proven—the offspring of the woman and its father shall be sent away by the women who superintend marriage into another country, and the guardians of the law shall send away the offspring of the man and its mother.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Theft is a mean, and robbery a shameless thing; and none of the sons of Zeus delight in fraud and violence, or ever practised either.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore let no one be deluded by poets or mythologers into a mistaken belief of such things, nor let him suppose, when he thieves or is guilty of violence, that he is doing nothing base, but only what the Gods themselves do.</div><div class="sentence"> For such tales are untrue and improbable; and he who steals or robs contrary to the law, is never either a God or the son of a God; of this the legislator ought to be better informed than all the poets put together.</div><div class="sentence"> Happy is he and may he be for ever happy, who is persuaded and listens to our words; but he who disobeys shall have to contend against the following law: If a man steal anything belonging to the public, whether that which he steals be much or little, he shall have the same punishment.</div><div class="sentence"> For he who steals a little steals with the same wish as he who steals much, but with less power, and he who takes up a greater amount, not having deposited it, is wholly unjust.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore the law is not disposed to inflict a less penalty on the one than on the other because his theft is less, but on the ground that the thief may possibly be in one case still curable, and may in another case be incurable.</div><div class="sentence"> If any one convict in a court of law a stranger or a slave of a theft of public property, let the court determine what punishment he shall suffer, or what penalty he shall pay, bearing in mind that he is probably not incurable.</div><div class="sentence"> But the citizen who has been brought up as our citizens will have been, if he be found guilty of robbing his country by fraud or violence, whether he be caught in the act or not, shall be punished with death; for he is incurable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Now for expeditions of war much consideration and many laws are required; the great principle of all is that no one of either sex should be without a commander; nor should the mind of any one be accustomed to do anything, either in jest or earnest, of his own motion, but in war and in peace he should look to and follow his leader, even in the least things being under his guidance; for example, he should stand or move, or exercise, or wash, or take his meals, or get up in the night to keep guard and deliver messages when he is bidden; and in the hour of danger he should not pursue and not retreat except by order of his superior; and in a word, not teach the soul or accustom her to know or understand how to do anything apart from others.</div><div class="sentence"> Of all soldiers the life should be always and in all things as far as possible in common and together; there neither is nor ever will be a higher, or better, or more scientific principle than this for the attainment of salvation and victory in war.</div><div class="sentence"> And we ought in time of peace from youth upwards to practise this habit of commanding others, and of being commanded by others; anarchy should have no place in the life of man or of the beasts who are subject to man.</div><div class="sentence"> I may add that all dances ought to be performed with a view to military excellence; and agility and ease should be cultivated for the same object, and also endurance of the want of meats and drinks, and of winter cold and summer heat, and of hard couches; and, above all, care should be taken not to destroy the peculiar qualities of the head and the feet by surrounding them with extraneous coverings, and so hindering their natural growth of hair and soles.</div><div class="sentence"> For these are the extremities, and of all the parts of the body, whether they are preserved or not is of the greatest consequence; the one is the servant of the whole body, and the other the master, in whom all the ruling senses are by nature set.</div><div class="sentence"> Let the young men imagine that he hears in what has preceded the praises of the military life; the law shall be as follows: He shall serve in war who is on the roll or appointed to some special service, and if any one is absent from cowardice, and without the leave of the generals, he shall be indicted before the military commanders for failure of service when the army comes home; and the soldiers shall be his judges; the heavy-armed, and the cavalry, and the other arms of the service shall form separate courts; and they shall bring the heavy-armed before the heavy-armed, and the horsemen before the horsemen, and the others in like manner before their peers; and he who is found guilty shall never be allowed to compete for any prize of valour, or indict another for not serving on an expedition, or be an accuser at all in any military matters.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover, the court shall further determine what punishment he shall suffer, or what penalty he shall pay.</div><div class="sentence"> When the suits for failure of service are completed, the leaders of the several kinds of troops shall again hold an assembly, and they shall adjudge the prizes of valour; and he who likes searching for judgment in his own branch of the service, saying nothing about any former expedition, nor producing any proof or witnesses to confirm his statement, but speaking only of the present occasion.</div><div class="sentence"> The crown of victory shall be an olive wreath which the victor shall offer up at the temple of any war-god whom he likes, adding an inscription for a testimony to last during life, that such an one has received the first, the second, or the third prize.</div><div class="sentence"> If any one goes on an expedition, and returns home before the appointed time, when the generals have not withdrawn the army, he shall be indicted for desertion before the same persons who took cognizance of failure of service, and if he be found guilty, the same punishment shall be inflicted on him.</div><div class="sentence"> Now every man who is engaged in any suit ought to be very careful of bringing false witness against any one, either intentionally or unintentionally, if he can help; for justice is truly said to be an honourable maiden, and falsehood is naturally repugnant to honour and justice.</div><div class="sentence"> A witness ought to be very careful not to sin against justice, as for example in what relates to the throwing away of arms—he must distinguish the throwing them away when necessary, and not make that a reproach, or bring an action against some innocent person on that account.</div><div class="sentence"> To make the distinction may be difficult; but still the law must attempt to define the different kinds in some way.</div><div class="sentence"> Let me endeavour to explain my meaning by an ancient tale: If Patroclus had been brought to the tent still alive but without his arms (and this has happened to innumerable persons), the original arms, which the poet says were presented to Peleus by the Gods as a nuptial gift when he married Thetis, remaining in the hands of Hector, then the base spirits of that day might have reproached the son of Menoetius with having cast away his arms.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, there is the case of those who have been thrown down precipices and lost their arms; and of those who at sea, and in stormy places, have been suddenly overwhelmed by floods of water; and there are numberless things of this kind which one might adduce by way of extenuation, and with the view of justifying a misfortune which is easily misrepresented.</div><div class="sentence"> We must, therefore, endeavour to divide to the best of our power the greater and more serious evil from the lesser.</div><div class="sentence"> And a distinction may be drawn in the use of terms of reproach.</div><div class="sentence"> A man does not always deserve to be called the thrower away of his shield; he may be only the loser of his arms.</div><div class="sentence"> For there is a great or rather absolute difference between him who is deprived of his arms by a sufficient force, and him who voluntarily lets his shield go.</div><div class="sentence"> Let the law then be as follows: If a person having arms is overtaken by the enemy and does not turn round and defend himself, but lets them go voluntarily or throws them away, choosing a base life and a swift escape rather than a courageous and noble and blessed death—in such a case of the throwing away of arms let justice be done, but the judge need take no note of the case just now mentioned; for the bad men ought always to be punished, in the hope that he may be improved, but not the unfortunate, for there is no advantage in that.</div><div class="sentence"> And what shall be the punishment suited to him who has thrown away his weapons of defence?</div><div class="sentence"> Tradition says that Caeneus, the Thessalian, was changed by a God from a woman into a man; but the converse miracle cannot now be wrought, or no punishment would be more proper than that the man who throws away his shield should be changed into a woman.</div><div class="sentence"> This however is impossible, and therefore let us make a law as nearly like this as we can—that he who loves his life too well shall be in no danger for the remainder of his days, but shall live for ever under the stigma of cowardice.</div><div class="sentence"> And let the law be in the following terms: When a man is found guilty of disgracefully throwing away his arms in war, no general or military officer shall allow him to serve as a soldier, or give him any place at all in the ranks of soldiers; and the officer who gives the coward any place, shall suffer a penalty which the public examiner shall exact of him; and if he be of the highest class, he shall pay a thousand drachmae; or if he be of the second class, five minae; or if he be of the third, three minae; or if he be of the fourth class, one mina.</div><div class="sentence"> And he who is found guilty of cowardice, shall not only be dismissed from manly dangers, which is a disgrace appropriate to his nature, but he shall pay a thousand drachmae, if he be of the highest class, and five minae if he be of the second class, and three if he be of the third class, and a mina, like the preceding, if he be of the fourth class.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  What regulations will be proper about examiners, seeing that some of our magistrates are elected by lot, and for a year, and some for a longer time and from selected persons?</div><div class="sentence"> Of such magistrates, who will be a sufficient censor or examiner, if any of them, weighed down by the pressure of office or his own inability to support the dignity of his office, be guilty of any crooked practice?</div><div class="sentence"> It is by no means easy to find a magistrate who excels other magistrates in virtue, but still we must endeavour to discover some censor or examiner who is more than man.</div><div class="sentence"> For the truth is, that there are many elements of dissolution in a state, as there are also in a ship, or in an animal; they all have their cords, and girders, and sinews—one nature diffused in many places, and called by many names; and the office of examiner is a most important element in the preservation and dissolution of states.</div><div class="sentence"> For if the examiners are better than the magistrates, and their duty is fulfilled justly and without blame, then the whole state and country flourishes and is happy; but if the examination of the magistrates is carried on in a wrong way, then, by the relaxation of that justice which is the uniting principle of all constitutions, every power in the state is rent asunder from every other; they no longer incline in the same direction, but fill the city with faction, and make many cities out of one, and soon bring all to destruction.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore the examiners ought to be admirable in every sort of virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us invent a mode of creating them, which shall be as follows: Every year, after the summer solstice, the whole city shall meet in the common precincts of Helios and Apollo, and shall present to the God three men out of their own number in the manner following: Each citizen shall select, not himself, but some other citizen whom he deems in every way the best, and who is not less than fifty years of age.</div><div class="sentence"> And out of the selected persons who have the greatest number of votes, they shall make a further selection until they reduce them to one-half, if they are an even number; but if they are not an even number, they shall subtract the one who has the smallest number of votes, and make them an even number, and then leave the half which have the greater number of votes.</div><div class="sentence"> And if two persons have an equal number of votes, and thus increase the number beyond one-half, they shall withdraw the younger of the two and do away the excess; and then including all the rest they shall again vote, until there are left three having an unequal number of votes.</div><div class="sentence"> But if all the three, or two out of the three, have equal votes, let them commit the election to good fate and fortune, and separate off by lot the first, and the second, and the third; these they shall crown with an olive wreath and give them the prize of excellence, at the same time proclaiming to all the world that the city of the Magnetes, by the providence of the Gods, is again preserved, and presents to the Sun and to Apollo her three best men as first-fruits, to be a common offering to them, according to the ancient law, as long as their lives answer to the judgment formed of them.</div><div class="sentence"> And these shall appoint in their first year twelve examiners, to continue until each has completed seventy-five years, to whom three shall afterwards be added yearly; and let these divide all the magistracies into twelve parts, and prove the holders of them by every sort of test to which a freeman may be subjected; and let them live while they hold office in the precinct of Helios and Apollo, in which they were chosen, and let each one form a judgment of some things individually, and of others in company with his colleagues; and let him place a writing in the agora about each magistracy, and what the magistrate ought to suffer or pay, according to the decision of the examiners.</div><div class="sentence"> And if a magistrate does not admit that he has been justly judged, let him bring the examiners before the select judges, and if he be acquitted by their decision, let him, if he will, accuse the examiners themselves; if, however, he be convicted, and have been condemned to death by the examiners, let him die (and of course he can only die once): but any other penalties which admit of being doubled let him suffer twice over.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  And now let us pass under review the examiners themselves; what will their examination be, and how conducted?</div><div class="sentence"> During the life of these men, whom the whole state counts worthy of the rewards of virtue, they shall have the first seat at all public assemblies, and at all Hellenic sacrifices and sacred missions, and other public and holy ceremonies in which they share.</div><div class="sentence"> The chiefs of each sacred mission shall be selected from them, and they only of all the citizens shall be adorned with a crown of laurel; they shall all be priests of Apollo and Helios; and one of them, who is judged first of the priests created in that year, shall be high priest; and they shall write up his name in each year to be a measure of time as long as the city lasts; and after their death they shall be laid out and carried to the grave and entombed in a manner different from the other citizens.</div><div class="sentence"> They shall be decked in a robe all of white, and there shall be no crying or lamentation over them; but a chorus of fifteen maidens, and another of boys, shall stand around the bier on either side, hymning the praises of the departed priests in alternate responses, declaring their blessedness in song all day long; and at dawn a hundred of the youths who practise gymnastic exercises, and whom the relations of the departed shall choose, shall carry the bier to the sepulchre, the young men marching first, dressed in the garb of warriors—the cavalry with their horses, the heavy-armed with their arms, and the others in like manner.</div><div class="sentence"> And boys near the bier and in front of it shall sing their national hymn, and maidens shall follow behind, and with them the women who have passed the age of child-bearing; next, although they are interdicted from other burials, let priests and priestesses follow, unless the Pythian oracle forbid them; for this burial is free from pollution.</div><div class="sentence"> The place of burial shall be an oblong vaulted chamber underground, constructed of tufa, which will last for ever, having stone couches placed side by side.</div><div class="sentence"> And here they will lay the blessed person, and cover the sepulchre with a circular mound of earth and plant a grove of trees around on every side but one; and on that side the sepulchre shall be allowed to extend for ever, and a new mound will not be required.</div><div class="sentence"> Every year they shall have contests in music and gymnastics, and in horsemanship, in honour of the dead.</div><div class="sentence"> These are the honours which shall be given to those who at the examination are found blameless; but if any of them, trusting to the scrutiny being over, should, after the judgment has been given, manifest the wickedness of human nature, let the law ordain that he who pleases shall indict him, and let the cause be tried in the following manner.</div><div class="sentence"> In the first place, the court shall be composed of the guardians of the law, and to them the surviving examiners shall be added, as well as the court of select judges; and let the pursuer lay his indictment in this form—he shall say that so-and-so is unworthy of the prize of virtue and of his office; and if the defendant be convicted let him be deprived of his office, and of the burial, and of the other honours given him.</div><div class="sentence"> But if the prosecutor do not obtain the fifth part of the votes, let him, if he be of the first-class, pay twelve minae, and eight if he be of the second class, and six if he be of the third class, and two minae if he be of the fourth class.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  The so-called decision of Rhadamanthus is worthy of all admiration.</div><div class="sentence"> He knew that the men of his own time believed and had no doubt that there were Gods, which was a reasonable belief in those days, because most men were the sons of Gods, and according to tradition he was one himself.</div><div class="sentence"> He appears to have thought that he ought to commit judgment to no man, but to the Gods only, and in this way suits were simply and speedily decided by him.</div><div class="sentence"> For he made the two parties take an oath respecting the points in dispute, and so got rid of the matter speedily and safely.</div><div class="sentence"> But now that a certain portion of mankind do not believe at all in the existence of the Gods, and others imagine that they have no care of us, and the opinion of most men, and of the worst men, is that in return for a small sacrifice and a few flattering words they will be their accomplices in purloining large sums and save them from many terrible punishments, the way of Rhadamanthus is no longer suited to the needs of justice; for as the opinions of men about the Gods are changed, the laws should also be changed—in the granting of suits a rational legislation ought to do away with the oaths of the parties on either side—he who obtains leave to bring an action should write down the charges, but should not add an oath; and the defendant in like manner should give his denial to the magistrates in writing, and not swear; for it is a dreadful thing to know, when many lawsuits are going on in a state, that almost half the people who meet one another quite unconcernedly at the public meals and in other companies and relations of private life are perjured.</div><div class="sentence"> Let the law, then, be as follows: A judge who is about to give judgment shall take an oath, and he who is choosing magistrates for the state shall either vote on oath or with a voting tablet which he brings from a temple; so too the judge of dances and of all music, and the superintendents and umpires of gymnastic and equestrian contests, and any matters in which, as far as men can judge, there is nothing to be gained by a false oath; but all cases in which a denial confirmed by an oath clearly results in a great advantage to the taker of the oath, shall be decided without the oath of the parties to the suit, and the presiding judges shall not permit either of them to use an oath for the sake of persuading, nor to call down curses on himself and his race, nor to use unseemly supplications or womanish laments.</div><div class="sentence"> But they shall ever be teaching and learning what is just in auspicious words; and he who does otherwise shall be supposed to speak beside the point, and the judges shall again bring him back to the question at issue.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, strangers in their dealings with strangers shall as at present have power to give and receive oaths, for they will not often grow old in the city or leave a fry of young ones like themselves to be the sons and heirs of the land.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  As to the initiation of private suits, let the manner of deciding causes between all citizens be the same as in cases in which any freeman is disobedient to the state in minor matters, of which the penalty is not stripes, imprisonment, or death.</div><div class="sentence"> But as regards attendance at choruses or processions or other shows, and as regards public services, whether the celebration of sacrifice in peace, or the payment of contributions in war—in all these cases, first comes the necessity of providing a remedy for the loss; and by those who will not obey, there shall be security given to the officers whom the city and the law empower to exact the sum due; and if they forfeit their security, let the goods which they have pledged be sold and the money given to the city; but if they ought to pay a larger sum, the several magistrates shall impose upon the disobedient a suitable penalty, and bring them before the court, until they are willing to do what they are ordered.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  Now a state which makes money from the cultivation of the soil only, and has no foreign trade, must consider what it will do about the emigration of its own people to other countries, and the reception of strangers from elsewhere.</div><div class="sentence"> About these matters the legislator has to consider, and he will begin by trying to persuade men as far as he can.</div><div class="sentence"> The intercourse of cities with one another is apt to create a confusion of manners; strangers are always suggesting novelties to strangers.</div><div class="sentence"> When states are well governed by good laws the mixture causes the greatest possible injury; but seeing that most cities are the reverse of well-ordered, the confusion which arises in them from the reception of strangers, and from the citizens themselves rushing off into other cities, when any one either young or old desires to travel anywhere abroad at whatever time, is of no consequence.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, the refusal of states to receive others, and for their own citizens never to go to other places, is an utter impossibility, and to the rest of the world is likely to appear ruthless and uncivilised; it is a practice adopted by people who use harsh words, such as xenelasia or banishment of strangers, and who have harsh and morose ways, as men think.</div><div class="sentence"> And to be thought or not to be thought well of by the rest of the world is no light matter; for the many are not so far wrong in their judgment of who are bad and who are good, as they are removed from the nature of virtue in themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> Even bad men have a divine instinct which guesses rightly, and very many who are utterly depraved form correct notions and judgments of the differences between the good and bad.</div><div class="sentence"> And the generality of cities are quite right in exhorting us to value a good reputation in the world, for there is no truth greater and more important than this—that he who is really good (I am speaking of the men who would be perfect) seeks for reputation with, but not without, the reality of goodness.</div><div class="sentence"> And our Cretan colony ought also to acquire the fairest and noblest reputation for virtue from other men; and there is every reason to expect that, if the reality answers to the idea, she will be one of the few well-ordered cities which the sun and the other Gods behold.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore, in the matter of journeys to other countries and the reception of strangers, we enact as follows: In the first place, let no one be allowed to go anywhere at all into a foreign country who is less than forty years of age; and no one shall go in a private capacity, but only in some public one, as a herald, or on an embassy, or on a sacred mission.</div><div class="sentence"> Going abroad on an expedition or in war is not to be included among travels of the class authorised by the state.</div><div class="sentence"> To Apollo at Delphi and to Zeus at Olympia and to Nemea and to the Isthmus, citizens should be sent to take part in the sacrifices and games there dedicated to the Gods; and they should send as many as possible, and the best and fairest that can be found, and they will make the city renowned at holy meetings in time of peace, procuring a glory which shall be the converse of that which is gained in war; and when they come home they shall teach the young that the institutions of other states are inferior to their own.</div><div class="sentence"> And they shall send spectators of another sort, if they have the consent of the guardians, being such citizens as desire to look a little more at leisure at the doings of other men; and these no law shall hinder.</div><div class="sentence"> For a city which has no experience of good and bad men or intercourse with them, can never be thoroughly and perfectly civilised, nor, again, can the citizens of a city properly observe the laws by habit only, and without an intelligent understanding of them.</div><div class="sentence"> And there always are in the world a few inspired men whose acquaintance is beyond price, and who spring up quite as much in ill-ordered as in well-ordered cities.</div><div class="sentence"> These are they whom the citizens of a well-ordered city should be ever seeking out, going forth over sea and over land to find him who is incorruptible—that he may establish more firmly institutions in his own state which are good already, and amend what is deficient; for without this examination and enquiry a city will never continue perfect any more than if the examination is ill-conducted.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span> <div class="sentence">  When the suits of the year are completed the following laws shall regulate their execution: In the first place, the judge shall assign to the party who wins the suit the whole property of him who loses, with the exception of mere necessaries, and the assignment shall be made through the herald immediately after each decision in the hearing of the judges; and when the month arrives following the month in which the courts are sitting, (unless the gainer of the suit has been previously satisfied) the court shall follow up the case, and hand over to the winner the goods of the loser; but if they find that he has not the means of paying, and the sum deficient is not less than a drachma, the insolvent person shall not have any right of going to law with any other man until he have satisfied the debt of the winning party; but other persons shall still have the right of bringing suits against him.</div><div class="sentence"> And if any one after he is condemned refuses to acknowledge the authority which condemned him, let the magistrates who are thus deprived of their authority bring him before the court of the guardians of the law, and if he be cast, let him be punished with death, as a subverter of the whole state and of the laws.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span> <div class="sentence">  Thus a man is born and brought up, and after this manner he begets and brings up his own children, and has his share of dealings with other men, and suffers if he has done wrong to any one, and receives satisfaction if he has been wronged, and so at length in due time he grows old under the protection of the laws, and his end comes in the order of nature.</div><div class="sentence"> Concerning the dead of either sex, the religious ceremonies which may fittingly be performed, whether appertaining to the Gods of the under-world or of this, shall be decided by the interpreters with absolute authority.</div><div class="sentence"> Their sepulchres are not to be in places which are fit for cultivation, and there shall be no monuments in such spots, either large or small, but they shall occupy that part of the country which is naturally adapted for receiving and concealing the bodies of the dead with as little hurt as possible to the living.</div><div class="sentence"> No man, living or dead, shall deprive the living of the sustenance which the earth, their foster-parent, is naturally inclined to provide for them.</div><div class="sentence"> And let not the mound be piled higher than would be the work of five men completed in five days; nor shall the stone which is placed over the spot be larger than would be sufficient to receive the praises of the dead included in four heroic lines.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor shall the laying out of the dead in the house continue for a longer time than is sufficient to distinguish between him who is in a trance only and him who is really dead, and speaking generally, the third day after death will be a fair time for carrying out the body to the sepulchre.</div><div class="sentence"> Now we must believe the legislator when he tells us that the soul is in all respects superior to the body, and that even in life what makes each one of us to be what we are is only the soul; and that the body follows us about in the likeness of each of us, and therefore, when we are dead, the bodies of the dead are quite rightly said to be our shades or images; for the true and immortal being of each one of us which is called the soul goes on her way to other Gods, before them to give an account—which is an inspiring hope to the good, but very terrible to the bad, as the laws of our fathers tell us; and they also say that not much can be done in the way of helping a man after he is dead.</div><div class="sentence"> But the living—he should be helped by all his kindred, that while in life he may be the holiest and justest of men, and after death may have no great sins to be punished in the world below.</div><div class="sentence"> If this be true, a man ought not to waste his substance under the idea that all this lifeless mass of flesh which is in process of burial is connected with him; he should consider that the son, or brother, or the beloved one, whoever he may be, whom he thinks he is laying in the earth, has gone away to complete and fulfil his own destiny, and that his duty is rightly to order the present, and to spend moderately on the lifeless altar of the Gods below.</div><div class="sentence"> But the legislator does not intend moderation to be taken in the sense of meanness.</div><div class="sentence"> Let the law, then, be as follows: The expenditure on the entire funeral of him who is of the highest class, shall not exceed five minae; and for him who is of the second class, three minae, and for him who is of the third class, two minae, and for him who is of the fourth class, one mina, will be a fair limit of expense.</div><div class="sentence"> The guardians of the law ought to take especial care of the different ages of life, whether childhood, or manhood, or any other age.</div><div class="sentence"> And at the end of all, let there be some one guardian of the law presiding, who shall be chosen by the friends of the deceased to superintend, and let it be glory to him to manage with fairness and moderation what relates to the dead, and a discredit to him if they are not well managed.</div><div class="sentence"> Let the laying out and other ceremonies be in accordance with custom, but to the statesman who adopts custom as his law we must give way in certain particulars.</div><div class="sentence"> It would be monstrous for example that he should command any man to weep or abstain from weeping over the dead; but he may forbid cries of lamentation, and not allow the voice of the mourner to be heard outside the house; also, he may forbid the bringing of the dead body into the open streets, or the processions of mourners in the streets, and may require that before daybreak they should be outside the city.</div><div class="sentence"> Let these, then, be our laws relating to such matters, and let him who obeys be free from penalty; but he who disobeys even a single guardian of the law shall be punished by them all with a fitting penalty.</div><div class="sentence"> Other modes of burial, or again the denial of burial, which is to be refused in the case of robbers of temples and parricides and the like, have been devised and are embodied in the preceding laws, so that now our work of legislation is pretty nearly at an end; but in all cases the end does not consist in doing something or acquiring something or establishing something—the end will be attained and finally accomplished, when we have provided for the perfect and lasting continuance of our institutions; until then our creation is incomplete.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  In which, then, of the parts or institutions of the state is any such guardian power to be found?</div><div class="sentence"> Can we say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I am not quite certain, Stranger; but I have a suspicion that you are referring to the assembly which you just now said was to meet at night.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  You understand me perfectly, Cleinias; and we must assume, as the argument implies, that this council possesses all virtue; and the beginning of virtue is not to make mistakes by guessing many things, but to look steadily at one thing, and on this to fix all our aims.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then now we shall see why there is nothing wonderful in states going astray—the reason is that their legislators have such different aims; nor is there anything wonderful in some laying down as their rule of justice, that certain individuals should bear rule in the state, whether they be good or bad, and others that the citizens should be rich, not caring whether they are the slaves of other men or not.</div><div class="sentence"> The tendency of others, again, is towards freedom; and some legislate with a view to two things at once—they want to be at the same time free and the lords of other states; but the wisest men, as they deem themselves to be, look to all these and similar aims, and there is no one of them which they exclusively honour, and to which they would have all things look.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Then, Stranger, our former assertion will hold; for we were saying that laws generally should look to one thing only; and this, as we admitted, was rightly said to be virtue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  And we said that virtue was of four kinds?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  And that mind was the leader of the four, and that to her the three other virtues and all other things ought to have regard?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  You follow me capitally, Cleinias, and I would ask you to follow me to the end, for we have already said that the mind of the pilot, the mind of the physician and of the general look to that one thing to which they ought to look; and now we may turn to mind political, of which, as of a human creature, we will ask a question:  O wonderful being, and to what are you looking?</div><div class="sentence"> The physician is able to tell his single aim in life, but you, the superior, as you declare yourself to be, of all intelligent beings, when you are asked are not able to tell.</div><div class="sentence"> Can you, Megillus, and you, Cleinias, say distinctly what is the aim of mind political, in return for the many explanations of things which I have given you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  We cannot, Stranger.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but ought we not to desire to see it, and to see where it is to be found?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  For example, where?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  For example, we were saying that there are four kinds of virtue, and as there are four of them, each of them must be one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And further, all four of them we call one; for we say that courage is virtue, and that prudence is virtue, and the same of the two others, as if they were in reality not many but one, that is, virtue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  There is no difficulty in seeing in what way the two differ from one another, and have received two names, and so of the rest.</div><div class="sentence"> But there is more difficulty in explaining why we call these two and the rest of them by the single name of virtue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  How do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I have no difficulty in explaining what I mean.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us distribute the subject into questions and answers.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Once more, what do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">074</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Ask me what is that one thing which I call virtue, and then again speak of as two, one part being courage and the other wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> I will tell you how that occurs:  One of them has to do with fear; in this the beasts also participate, and quite young children—I mean courage; for a courageous temper is a gift of nature and not of reason.</div><div class="sentence"> But without reason there never has been, or is, or will be a wise and understanding soul; it is of a different nature.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">076</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  I have now told you in what way the two are different, and do you in return tell me in what way they are one and the same.</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose that I ask you in what way the four are one, and when you have answered me, you will have a right to ask of me in return in what way they are four; and then let us proceed to enquire whether in the case of things which have a name and also a definition to them, true knowledge consists in knowing the name only and not the definition.</div><div class="sentence"> Can he who is good for anything be ignorant of all this without discredit where great and glorious truths are concerned?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">078</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And is there anything greater to the legislator and the guardian of the law, and to him who thinks that he excels all other men in virtue, and has won the palm of excellence, than these very qualities of which we are now speaking—courage, temperance, wisdom, justice?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">079</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  How can there be anything greater?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And ought not the interpreters, the teachers, the lawgivers, the guardians of the other citizens, to excel the rest of mankind, and perfectly to show him who desires to learn and know or whose evil actions require to be punished and reproved, what is the nature of virtue and vice?</div><div class="sentence"> Or shall some poet who has found his way into the city, or some chance person who pretends to be an instructor of youth, show himself to be better than him who has won the prize for every virtue?</div><div class="sentence"> And can we wonder that when the guardians are not adequate in speech or action, and have no adequate knowledge of virtue, the city being unguarded should experience the common fate of cities in our day?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">081</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Wonder!</div><div class="sentence"> no.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">082</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, must we do as we said?</div><div class="sentence"> Or can we give our guardians a more precise knowledge of virtue in speech and action than the many have?</div><div class="sentence"> or is there any way in which our city can be made to resemble the head and senses of rational beings because possessing such a guardian power?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">083</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What, Stranger, is the drift of your comparison?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">084</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Do we not see that the city is the trunk, and are not the younger guardians, who are chosen for their natural gifts, placed in the head of the state, having their souls all full of eyes, with which they look about the whole city?</div><div class="sentence"> They keep watch and hand over their perceptions to the memory, and inform the elders of all that happens in the city; and those whom we compared to the mind, because they have many wise thoughts—that is to say, the old men—take counsel, and making use of the younger men as their ministers, and advising with them—in this way both together truly preserve the whole state:  Shall this or some other be the order of our state?</div><div class="sentence"> Are all our citizens to be equal in acquirements, or shall there be special persons among them who have received a more careful training and education?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">085</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  That they should be equal, my good sir, is impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">086</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then we ought to proceed to some more exact training than any which has preceded.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">088</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And must not that of which we are in need be the one to which we were just now alluding?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Did we not say that the workman or guardian, if he be perfect in every respect, ought not only to be able to see the many aims, but he should press onward to the one?</div><div class="sentence"> This he should know, and knowing, order all things with a view to it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And can any one have a more exact way of considering or contemplating anything, than the being able to look at one idea gathered from many different things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">093</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Perhaps not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Not 'Perhaps not,' but 'Certainly not,' my good sir, is the right answer.</div><div class="sentence"> There never has been a truer method than this discovered by any man.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I bow to your authority, Stranger; let us proceed in the way which you propose.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Then, as would appear, we must compel the guardians of our divine state to perceive, in the first place, what that principle is which is the same in all the four—the same, as we affirm, in courage and in temperance, and in justice and in prudence, and which, being one, we call as we ought, by the single name of virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> To this, my friends, we will, if you please, hold fast, and not let go until we have sufficiently explained what that is to which we are to look, whether to be regarded as one, or as a whole, or as both, or in whatever way.</div><div class="sentence"> Are we likely ever to be in a virtuous condition, if we cannot tell whether virtue is many, or four, or one?</div><div class="sentence"> Certainly, if we take counsel among ourselves, we shall in some way contrive that this principle has a place amongst us; but if you have made up your mind that we should let the matter alone, we will.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  We must not, Stranger, by the God of strangers I swear that we must not, for in our opinion you speak most truly; but we should like to know how you will accomplish your purpose.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">098</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Wait a little before you ask; and let us, first of all, be quite agreed with one another that the purpose has to be accomplished.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly, it ought to be, if it can be.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">100</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Well, and about the good and the honourable, are we to take the same view?</div><div class="sentence"> Are our guardians only to know that each of them is many, or also how and in what way they are one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  They must consider also in what sense they are one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And are they to consider only, and to be unable to set forth what they think?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">103</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not; that would be the state of a slave.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  And may not the same be said of all good things—that the true guardians of the laws ought to know the truth about them, and to be able to interpret them in words, and carry them out in action, judging of what is and of what is not well, according to nature?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Is not the knowledge of the Gods which we have set forth with so much zeal one of the noblest sorts of knowledge—to know that they are, and know how great is their power, as far as in man lies?</div><div class="sentence"> We do indeed excuse the mass of the citizens, who only follow the voice of the laws, but we refuse to admit as guardians any who do not labour to obtain every possible evidence that there is respecting the Gods; our city is forbidden and not allowed to choose as a guardian of the law, or to place in the select order of virtue, him who is not an inspired man, and has not laboured at these things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  It is certainly just, as you say, that he who is indolent about such matters or incapable should be rejected, and that things honourable should be put away from him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Are we assured that there are two things which lead men to believe in the Gods, as we have already stated?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">109</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What are they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  One is the argument about the soul, which has been already mentioned—that it is the eldest and most divine of all things, to which motion attaining generation gives perpetual existence; the other was an argument from the order of the motion of the stars, and of all things under the dominion of the mind which ordered the universe.</div><div class="sentence"> If a man look upon the world not lightly or ignorantly, there was never any one so godless who did not experience an effect opposite to that which the many imagine.</div><div class="sentence"> For they think that those who handle these matters by the help of astronomy, and the accompanying arts of demonstration, may become godless, because they see, as far as they can see, things happening by necessity, and not by an intelligent will accomplishing good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">111</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  But what is the fact?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">112</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Just the opposite, as I said, of the opinion which once prevailed among men, that the sun and stars are without soul.</div><div class="sentence"> Even in those days men wondered about them, and that which is now ascertained was then conjectured by some who had a more exact knowledge of them—that if they had been things without soul, and had no mind, they could never have moved with numerical exactness so wonderful; and even at that time some ventured to hazard the conjecture that mind was the orderer of the universe.</div><div class="sentence"> But these same persons again mistaking the nature of the soul, which they conceived to be younger and not older than the body, once more overturned the world, or rather, I should say, themselves; for the bodies which they saw moving in heaven all appeared to be full of stones, and earth, and many other lifeless substances, and to these they assigned the causes of all things.</div><div class="sentence"> Such studies gave rise to much atheism and perplexity, and the poets took occasion to be abusive—comparing the philosophers to she-dogs uttering vain howlings, and talking other nonsense of the same sort.</div><div class="sentence"> But now, as I said, the case is reversed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">113</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">114</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  No man can be a true worshipper of the Gods who does not know these two principles—that the soul is the eldest of all things which are born, and is immortal and rules over all bodies; moreover, as I have now said several times, he who has not contemplated the mind of nature which is said to exist in the stars, and gone through the previous training, and seen the connexion of music with these things, and harmonized them all with laws and institutions, is not able to give a reason of such things as have a reason.</div><div class="sentence"> And he who is unable to acquire this in addition to the ordinary virtues of a citizen, can hardly be a good ruler of a whole state; but he should be the subordinate of other rulers.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore, Cleinias and Megillus, let us consider whether we may not add to all the other laws which we have discussed this further one—that the nocturnal assembly of the magistrates, which has also shared in the whole scheme of education proposed by us, shall be a guard set according to law for the salvation of the state.</div><div class="sentence"> Shall we propose this?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">115</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly, my good friend, we will if the thing is in any degree possible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">116</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  Let us make a common effort to gain such an object; for I too will gladly share in the attempt.</div><div class="sentence"> Of these matters I have had much experience, and have often considered them, and I dare say that I shall be able to find others who will also help.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">117</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I agree, Stranger, that we should proceed along the road in which God is guiding us; and how we can proceed rightly has now to be investigated and explained.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">118</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  O Megillus and Cleinias, about these matters we cannot legislate further until the council is constituted; when that is done, then we will determine what authority they shall have of their own; but the explanation of how this is all to be ordered would only be given rightly in a long discourse.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">119</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean, and what new thing is this?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">120</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  In the first place, a list would have to be made out of those who by their ages and studies and dispositions and habits are well fitted for the duty of a guardian.</div><div class="sentence"> In the next place, it will not be easy for them to discover themselves what they ought to learn, or become the disciple of one who has already made the discovery.</div><div class="sentence"> Furthermore, to write down the times at which, and during which, they ought to receive the several kinds of instruction, would be a vain thing; for the learners themselves do not know what is learned to advantage until the knowledge which is the result of learning has found a place in the soul of each.</div><div class="sentence"> And so these details, although they could not be truly said to be secret, might be said to be incapable of being stated beforehand, because when stated they would have no meaning.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">121</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What then are we to do, Stranger, under these circumstances?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">122</span><div class="speaker">ATHENIAN</div><div class="sentence">  As the proverb says, the answer is no secret, but open to all of us:  We must risk the whole on the chance of throwing, as they say, thrice six or thrice ace, and I am willing to share with you the danger by stating and explaining to you my views about education and nurture, which is the question coming to the surface again.</div><div class="sentence"> The danger is not a slight or ordinary one, and I would advise you, Cleinias, in particular, to see to the matter; for if you order rightly the city of the Magnetes, or whatever name God may give it, you will obtain the greatest glory; or at any rate you will be thought the most courageous of men in the estimation of posterity.</div><div class="sentence"> Dear companions, if this our divine assembly can only be established, to them we will hand over the city; none of the present company of legislators, as I may call them, would hesitate about that.</div><div class="sentence"> And the state will be perfected and become a waking reality, which a little while ago we attempted to create as a dream and in idea only, mingling together reason and mind in one image, in the hope that our citizens might be duly mingled and rightly educated; and being educated, and dwelling in the citadel of the land, might become perfect guardians, such as we have never seen in all our previous life, by reason of the saving virtue which is in them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">123</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Dear Cleinias, after all that has been said, either we must detain the Stranger, and by supplications and in all manner of ways make him share in the foundation of the city, or we must give up the undertaking.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">124</span><div class="speaker">CLEINIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true, Megillus; and you must join with me in detaining him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">125</span><div class="speaker">MEGILLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I will.</div></div>
