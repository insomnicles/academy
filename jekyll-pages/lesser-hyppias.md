<h2>APPENDIX I.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  It seems impossible to separate by any exact line the genuine writings of Plato from the spurious.</div><div class="sentence"> The only external evidence to them which is of much value is that of Aristotle; for the Alexandrian catalogues of a century later include manifest forgeries.</div><div class="sentence"> Even the value of the Aristotelian authority is a good deal impaired by the uncertainty concerning the date and authorship of the writings which are ascribed to him.</div><div class="sentence"> And several of the citations of Aristotle omit the name of Plato, and some of them omit the name of the dialogue from which they are taken.</div><div class="sentence"> Prior, however, to the enquiry about the writings of a particular author, general considerations which equally affect all evidence to the genuineness of ancient writings are the following: Shorter works are more likely to have been forged, or to have received an erroneous designation, than longer ones; and some kinds of composition, such as epistles or panegyrical orations, are more liable to suspicion than others; those, again, which have a taste of sophistry in them, or the ring of a later age, or the slighter character of a rhetorical exercise, or in which a motive or some affinity to spurious writings can be detected, or which seem to have originated in a name or statement really occurring in some classical author, are also of doubtful credit; while there is no instance of any ancient writing proved to be a forgery, which combines excellence with length.</div><div class="sentence"> A really great and original writer would have no object in fathering his works on Plato; and to the forger or imitator, the 'literary hack' of Alexandria and Athens, the Gods did not grant originality or genius.</div><div class="sentence"> Further, in attempting to balance the evidence for and against a Platonic dialogue, we must not forget that the form of the Platonic writing was common to several of his contemporaries.</div><div class="sentence"> Aeschines, Euclid, Phaedo, Antisthenes, and in the next generation Aristotle, are all said to have composed dialogues; and mistakes of names are very likely to have occurred.</div><div class="sentence"> Greek literature in the third century before Christ was almost as voluminous as our own, and without the safeguards of regular publication, or printing, or binding, or even of distinct titles.</div><div class="sentence"> An unknown writing was naturally attributed to a known writer whose works bore the same character; and the name once appended easily obtained authority.</div><div class="sentence"> A tendency may also be observed to blend the works and opinions of the master with those of his scholars.</div><div class="sentence"> To a later Platonist, the difference between Plato and his imitators was not so perceptible as to ourselves.</div><div class="sentence"> The Memorabilia of Xenophon and the Dialogues of Plato are but a part of a considerable Socratic literature which has passed away.</div><div class="sentence"> And we must consider how we should regard the question of the genuineness of a particular writing, if this lost literature had been preserved to us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  These considerations lead us to adopt the following criteria of genuineness: (1) That is most certainly Plato's which Aristotle attributes to him by name, which (2) is of considerable length, of (3) great excellence, and also (4) in harmony with the general spirit of the Platonic writings.</div><div class="sentence"> But the testimony of Aristotle cannot always be distinguished from that of a later age (see above); and has various degrees of importance.</div><div class="sentence"> Those writings which he cites without mentioning Plato, under their own names, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> the Hippias, the Funeral Oration, the Phaedo, etc., have an inferior degree of evidence in their favour.</div><div class="sentence"> They may have been supposed by him to be the writings of another, although in the case of really great works, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> the Phaedo, this is not credible; those again which are quoted but not named, are still more defective in their external credentials.</div><div class="sentence"> There may be also a possibility that Aristotle was mistaken, or may have confused the master and his scholars in the case of a short writing; but this is inconceivable about a more important work, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> the Laws, especially when we remember that he was living at Athens, and a frequenter of the groves of the Academy, during the last twenty years of Plato's life.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor must we forget that in all his numerous citations from the Platonic writings he never attributes any passage found in the extant dialogues to any one but Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> And lastly, we may remark that one or two great writings, such as the Parmenides and the Politicus, which are wholly devoid of Aristotelian (1) credentials may be fairly attributed to Plato, on the ground of (2) length, (3) excellence, and (4) accordance with the general spirit of his writings.</div><div class="sentence"> Indeed the greater part of the evidence for the genuineness of ancient Greek authors may be summed up under two heads only: (1) excellence; and (2) uniformity of tradition—a kind of evidence, which though in many cases sufficient, is of inferior value.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Proceeding upon these principles we appear to arrive at the conclusion that nineteen-twentieths of all the writings which have ever been ascribed to Plato, are undoubtedly genuine.</div><div class="sentence"> There is another portion of them, including the Epistles, the Epinomis, the dialogues rejected by the ancients themselves, namely, the Axiochus, De justo, De virtute, Demodocus, Sisyphus, Eryxias, which on grounds, both of internal and external evidence, we are able with equal certainty to reject.</div><div class="sentence"> But there still remains a small portion of which we are unable to affirm either that they are genuine or spurious.</div><div class="sentence"> They may have been written in youth, or possibly like the works of some painters, may be partly or wholly the compositions of pupils; or they may have been the writings of some contemporary transferred by accident to the more celebrated name of Plato, or of some Platonist in the next generation who aspired to imitate his master.</div><div class="sentence"> Not that on grounds either of language or philosophy we should lightly reject them.</div><div class="sentence"> Some difference of style, or inferiority of execution, or inconsistency of thought, can hardly be considered decisive of their spurious character.</div><div class="sentence"> For who always does justice to himself, or who writes with equal care at all times?</div><div class="sentence"> Certainly not Plato, who exhibits the greatest differences in dramatic power, in the formation of sentences, and in the use of words, if his earlier writings are compared with his later ones, say the Protagoras or Phaedrus with the Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> Or who can be expected to think in the same manner during a period of authorship extending over above fifty years, in an age of great intellectual activity, as well as of political and literary transition?</div><div class="sentence"> Certainly not Plato, whose earlier writings are separated from his later ones by as wide an interval of philosophical speculation as that which separates his later writings from Aristotle.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  The dialogues which have been translated in the first Appendix, and which appear to have the next claim to genuineness among the Platonic writings, are the Lesser Hippias, the Menexenus or Funeral Oration, the First Alcibiades.</div><div class="sentence"> Of these, the Lesser Hippias and the Funeral Oration are cited by Aristotle; the first in the Metaphysics, the latter in the Rhetoric.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither of them are expressly attributed to Plato, but in his citation of both of them he seems to be referring to passages in the extant dialogues.</div><div class="sentence"> From the mention of 'Hippias' in the singular by Aristotle, we may perhaps infer that he was unacquainted with a second dialogue bearing the same name.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover, the mere existence of a Greater and Lesser Hippias, and of a First and Second Alcibiades, does to a certain extent throw a doubt upon both of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Though a very clever and ingenious work, the Lesser Hippias does not appear to contain anything beyond the power of an imitator, who was also a careful student of the earlier Platonic writings, to invent.</div><div class="sentence"> The motive or leading thought of the dialogue may be detected in Xen.</div><div class="sentence"> Mem., and there is no similar instance of a 'motive' which is taken from Xenophon in an undoubted dialogue of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, the upholders of the genuineness of the dialogue will find in the Hippias a true Socratic spirit; they will compare the Ion as being akin both in subject and treatment; they will urge the authority of Aristotle; and they will detect in the treatment of the Sophist, in the satirical reasoning upon Homer, in the reductio ad absurdum of the doctrine that vice is ignorance, traces of a Platonic authorship.</div><div class="sentence"> In reference to the last point we are doubtful, as in some of the other dialogues, whether the author is asserting or overthrowing the paradox of Socrates, or merely following the argument 'whither the wind blows.'</div><div class="sentence"> That no conclusion is arrived at is also in accordance with the character of the earlier dialogues.</div><div class="sentence"> The resemblances or imitations of the Gorgias, Protagoras, and Euthydemus, which have been observed in the Hippias, cannot with certainty be adduced on either side of the argument.</div><div class="sentence"> On the whole, more may be said in favour of the genuineness of the Hippias than against it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  The Menexenus or Funeral Oration is cited by Aristotle, and is interesting as supplying an example of the manner in which the orators praised 'the Athenians among the Athenians,' falsifying persons and dates, and casting a veil over the gloomier events of Athenian history.</div><div class="sentence"> It exhibits an acquaintance with the funeral oration of Thucydides, and was, perhaps, intended to rival that great work.</div><div class="sentence"> If genuine, the proper place of the Menexenus would be at the end of the Phaedrus.</div><div class="sentence"> The satirical opening and the concluding words bear a great resemblance to the earlier dialogues; the oration itself is professedly a mimetic work, like the speeches in the Phaedrus, and cannot therefore be tested by a comparison of the other writings of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> The funeral oration of Pericles is expressly mentioned in the Phaedrus, and this may have suggested the subject, in the same manner that the Cleitophon appears to be suggested by the slight mention of Cleitophon and his attachment to Thrasymachus in the Republic; and the Theages by the mention of Theages in the Apology and Republic; or as the Second Alcibiades seems to be founded upon the text of Xenophon, Mem.</div><div class="sentence"> A similar taste for parody appears not only in the Phaedrus, but in the Protagoras, in the Symposium, and to a certain extent in the Parmenides.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  To these two doubtful writings of Plato I have added the First Alcibiades, which, of all the disputed dialogues of Plato, has the greatest merit, and is somewhat longer than any of them, though not verified by the testimony of Aristotle, and in many respects at variance with the Symposium in the description of the relations of Socrates and Alcibiades.</div><div class="sentence"> Like the Lesser Hippias and the Menexenus, it is to be compared to the earlier writings of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> The motive of the piece may, perhaps, be found in that passage of the Symposium in which Alcibiades describes himself as self-convicted by the words of Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> For the disparaging manner in which Schleiermacher has spoken of this dialogue there seems to be no sufficient foundation.</div><div class="sentence"> At the same time, the lesson imparted is simple, and the irony more transparent than in the undoubted dialogues of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> We know, too, that Alcibiades was a favourite thesis, and that at least five or six dialogues bearing this name passed current in antiquity, and are attributed to contemporaries of Socrates and Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> (1) In the entire absence of real external evidence (for the catalogues of the Alexandrian librarians cannot be regarded as trustworthy); and (2) in the absence of the highest marks either of poetical or philosophical excellence; and (3) considering that we have express testimony to the existence of contemporary writings bearing the name of Alcibiades, we are compelled to suspend our judgment on the genuineness of the extant dialogue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  Neither at this point, nor at any other, do we propose to draw an absolute line of demarcation between genuine and spurious writings of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> They fade off imperceptibly from one class to another.</div><div class="sentence"> There may have been degrees of genuineness in the dialogues themselves, as there are certainly degrees of evidence by which they are supported.</div><div class="sentence"> The traditions of the oral discourses both of Socrates and Plato may have formed the basis of semi-Platonic writings; some of them may be of the same mixed character which is apparent in Aristotle and Hippocrates, although the form of them is different.</div><div class="sentence"> But the writings of Plato, unlike the writings of Aristotle, seem never to have been confused with the writings of his disciples: this was probably due to their definite form, and to their inimitable excellence.</div><div class="sentence"> The three dialogues which we have offered in the Appendix to the criticism of the reader may be partly spurious and partly genuine; they may be altogether spurious;—that is an alternative which must be frankly admitted.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor can we maintain of some other dialogues, such as the Parmenides, and the Sophist, and Politicus, that no considerable objection can be urged against them, though greatly overbalanced by the weight (chiefly) of internal evidence in their favour.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor, on the other hand, can we exclude a bare possibility that some dialogues which are usually rejected, such as the Greater Hippias and the Cleitophon, may be genuine.</div><div class="sentence"> The nature and object of these semi-Platonic writings require more careful study and more comparison of them with one another, and with forged writings in general, than they have yet received, before we can finally decide on their character.</div><div class="sentence"> We do not consider them all as genuine until they can be proved to be spurious, as is often maintained and still more often implied in this and similar discussions; but should say of some of them, that their genuineness is neither proven nor disproven until further evidence about them can be adduced.</div><div class="sentence"> And we are as confident that the Epistles are spurious, as that the Republic, the Timaeus, and the Laws are genuine.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  On the whole, not a twentieth part of the writings which pass under the name of Plato, if we exclude the works rejected by the ancients themselves and two or three other plausible inventions, can be fairly doubted by those who are willing to allow that a considerable change and growth may have taken place in his philosophy (see above).</div><div class="sentence"> That twentieth debatable portion scarcely in any degree affects our judgment of Plato, either as a thinker or a writer, and though suggesting some interesting questions to the scholar and critic, is of little importance to the general reader.</div></div>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  The Lesser Hippias may be compared with the earlier dialogues of Plato, in which the contrast of Socrates and the Sophists is most strongly exhibited.</div><div class="sentence"> Hippias, like Protagoras and Gorgias, though civil, is vain and boastful: he knows all things; he can make anything, including his own clothes; he is a manufacturer of poems and declamations, and also of seal-rings, shoes, strigils; his girdle, which he has woven himself, is of a finer than Persian quality.</div><div class="sentence"> He is a vainer, lighter nature than the two great Sophists (compare Protag.</div><div class="sentence"> ), but of the same character with them, and equally impatient of the short cut-and-thrust method of Socrates, whom he endeavours to draw into a long oration.</div><div class="sentence"> At last, he gets tired of being defeated at every point by Socrates, and is with difficulty induced to proceed (compare Thrasymachus, Protagoras, Callicles, and others, to whom the same reluctance is ascribed).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Hippias like Protagoras has common sense on his side, when he argues, citing passages of the Iliad in support of his view, that Homer intended Achilles to be the bravest, Odysseus the wisest of the Greeks.</div><div class="sentence"> But he is easily overthrown by the superior dialectics of Socrates, who pretends to show that Achilles is not true to his word, and that no similar inconsistency is to be found in Odysseus.</div><div class="sentence"> Hippias replies that Achilles unintentionally, but Odysseus intentionally, speaks falsehood.</div><div class="sentence"> But is it better to do wrong intentionally or unintentionally?</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates, relying on the analogy of the arts, maintains the former, Hippias the latter of the two alternatives...All this is quite conceived in the spirit of Plato, who is very far from making Socrates always argue on the side of truth.</div><div class="sentence"> The over-reasoning on Homer, which is of course satirical, is also in the spirit of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> Poetry turned logic is even more ridiculous than 'rhetoric turned logic,' and equally fallacious.</div><div class="sentence"> There were reasoners in ancient as well as in modern times, who could never receive the natural impression of Homer, or of any other book which they read.</div><div class="sentence"> The argument of Socrates, in which he picks out the apparent inconsistencies and discrepancies in the speech and actions of Achilles, and the final paradox, 'that he who is true is also false,' remind us of the interpretation by Socrates of Simonides in the Protagoras, and of similar reasonings in the first book of the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> The discrepancies which Socrates discovers in the words of Achilles are perhaps as great as those discovered by some of the modern separatists of the Homeric poems...</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  At last, Socrates having caught Hippias in the toils of the voluntary and involuntary, is obliged to confess that he is wandering about in the same labyrinth; he makes the reflection on himself which others would make upon him (compare Protagoras).</div><div class="sentence"> He does not wonder that he should be in a difficulty, but he wonders at Hippias, and he becomes sensible of the gravity of the situation, when ordinary men like himself can no longer go to the wise and be taught by them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  It may be remarked as bearing on the genuineness of this dialogue: (1) that the manners of the speakers are less subtle and refined than in the other dialogues of Plato; (2) that the sophistry of Socrates is more palpable and unblushing, and also more unmeaning; (3) that many turns of thought and style are found in it which appear also in the other dialogues:—whether resemblances of this kind tell in favour of or against the genuineness of an ancient writing, is an important question which will have to be answered differently in different cases.</div><div class="sentence"> For that a writer may repeat himself is as true as that a forger may imitate; and Plato elsewhere, either of set purpose or from forgetfulness, is full of repetitions.</div><div class="sentence"> The parallelisms of the Lesser Hippias, as already remarked, are not of the kind which necessarily imply that the dialogue is the work of a forger.</div><div class="sentence"> The parallelisms of the Greater Hippias with the other dialogues, and the allusion to the Lesser (where Hippias sketches the programme of his next lecture, and invites Socrates to attend and bring any friends with him who may be competent judges), are more than suspicious:—they are of a very poor sort, such as we cannot suppose to have been due to Plato himself.</div><div class="sentence"> The Greater Hippias more resembles the Euthydemus than any other dialogue; but is immeasurably inferior to it.</div><div class="sentence"> The Lesser Hippias seems to have more merit than the Greater, and to be more Platonic in spirit.</div><div class="sentence"> The character of Hippias is the same in both dialogues, but his vanity and boasting are even more exaggerated in the Greater Hippias.</div><div class="sentence"> His art of memory is specially mentioned in both.</div><div class="sentence"> He is an inferior type of the same species as Hippodamus of Miletus (Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Pol.).</div><div class="sentence"> Some passages in which the Lesser Hippias may be advantageously compared with the undoubtedly genuine dialogues of Plato are the following:—Less.</div><div class="sentence"> Hipp.</div><div class="sentence"> : compare Republic (Socrates' cunning in argument): compare Laches (Socrates' feeling about arguments): compare Republic (Socrates not unthankful): compare Republic (Socrates dishonest in argument).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  The Lesser Hippias, though inferior to the other dialogues, may be reasonably believed to have been written by Plato, on the ground (1) of considerable excellence; (2) of uniform tradition beginning with Aristotle and his school.</div><div class="sentence"> That the dialogue falls below the standard of Plato's other works, or that he has attributed to Socrates an unmeaning paradox (perhaps with the view of showing that he could beat the Sophists at their own weapons; or that he could 'make the worse appear the better cause'; or merely as a dialectical experiment)—are not sufficient reasons for doubting the genuineness of the work.</div></div>

</div><div id="link2H_4_0002" class="book_section">
<h2>LESSER HIPPIAS</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span><div class="speaker">EUDICUS</div><div class="sentence">  Why are you silent, Socrates, after the magnificent display which Hippias has been making?</div><div class="sentence"> Why do you not either refute his words, if he seems to you to have been wrong in any point, or join with us in commending him?</div><div class="sentence"> There is the more reason why you should speak, because we are now alone, and the audience is confined to those who may fairly claim to take part in a philosophical discussion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I should greatly like, Eudicus, to ask Hippias the meaning of what he was saying just now about Homer.</div><div class="sentence"> I have heard your father, Apemantus, declare that the Iliad of Homer is a finer poem than the Odyssey in the same degree that Achilles was a better man than Odysseus; Odysseus, he would say, is the central figure of the one poem and Achilles of the other.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, I should like to know, if Hippias has no objection to tell me, what he thinks about these two heroes, and which of them he maintains to be the better; he has already told us in the course of his exhibition many things of various kinds about Homer and divers other poets.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span><div class="speaker">EUDICUS</div><div class="sentence">  I am sure that Hippias will be delighted to answer anything which you would like to ask; tell me, Hippias, if Socrates asks you a question, will you answer him?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Indeed, Eudicus, I should be strangely inconsistent if I refused to answer Socrates, when at each Olympic festival, as I went up from my house at Elis to the temple of Olympia, where all the Hellenes were assembled, I continually professed my willingness to perform any of the exhibitions which I had prepared, and to answer any questions which any one had to ask.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Truly, Hippias, you are to be congratulated, if at every Olympic festival you have such an encouraging opinion of your own wisdom when you go up to the temple.</div><div class="sentence"> I doubt whether any muscular hero would be so fearless and confident in offering his body to the combat at Olympia, as you are in offering your mind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  And with good reason, Socrates; for since the day when I first entered the lists at Olympia I have never found any man who was my superior in anything.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Gorgias.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What an ornament, Hippias, will the reputation of your wisdom be to the city of Elis and to your parents!</div><div class="sentence"> But to return:  what say you of Odysseus and Achilles?</div><div class="sentence"> Which is the better of the two?</div><div class="sentence"> and in what particular does either surpass the other?</div><div class="sentence"> For when you were exhibiting and there was company in the room, though I could not follow you, I did not like to ask what you meant, because a crowd of people were present, and I was afraid that the question might interrupt your exhibition.</div><div class="sentence"> But now that there are not so many of us, and my friend Eudicus bids me ask, I wish you would tell me what you were saying about these two heroes, so that I may clearly understand; how did you distinguish them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I shall have much pleasure, Socrates, in explaining to you more clearly than I could in public my views about these and also about other heroes.</div><div class="sentence"> I say that Homer intended Achilles to be the bravest of the men who went to Troy, Nestor the wisest, and Odysseus the wiliest.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  O rare Hippias, will you be so good as not to laugh, if I find a difficulty in following you, and repeat my questions several times over?</div><div class="sentence"> Please to answer me kindly and gently.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I should be greatly ashamed of myself, Socrates, if I, who teach others and take money of them, could not, when I was asked by you, answer in a civil and agreeable manner.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Thank you:  the fact is, that I seemed to understand what you meant when you said that the poet intended Achilles to be the bravest of men, and also that he intended Nestor to be the wisest; but when you said that he meant Odysseus to be the wiliest, I must confess that I could not understand what you were saying.</div><div class="sentence"> Will you tell me, and then I shall perhaps understand you better; has not Homer made Achilles wily?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not, Socrates; he is the most straight-forward of mankind, and when Homer introduces them talking with one another in the passage called the Prayers, Achilles is supposed by the poet to say to Odysseus: —</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span> <div class="sentence">  'Son of Laertes, sprung from heaven, crafty Odysseus, I will speak out plainly the word which I intend to carry out in act, and which will, I believe, be accomplished.</div><div class="sentence"> For I hate him like the gates of death who thinks one thing and says another.</div><div class="sentence"> But I will speak that which shall be accomplished.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span> <div class="sentence">  Now, in these verses he clearly indicates the character of the two men; he shows Achilles to be true and simple, and Odysseus to be wily and false; for he supposes Achilles to be addressing Odysseus in these lines.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Now, Hippias, I think that I understand your meaning; when you say that Odysseus is wily, you clearly mean that he is false?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly so, Socrates; it is the character of Odysseus, as he is represented by Homer in many passages both of the Iliad and Odyssey.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And Homer must be presumed to have meant that the true man is not the same as the false?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is that your own opinion, Hippias?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly; how can I have any other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, as there is no possibility of asking Homer what he meant in these verses of his, let us leave him; but as you show a willingness to take up his cause, and your opinion agrees with what you declare to be his, will you answer on behalf of yourself and him?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I will; ask shortly anything which you like.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do you say that the false, like the sick, have no power to do things, or that they have the power to do things?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Nor will consideration help you, Hippias, as I believe; but then if I am right, remember what the consequence will be.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">098</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I do not know what you mean, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose that you are not using your art of memory, doubtless because you think that such an accomplishment is not needed on the present occasion.</div><div class="sentence"> I will therefore remind you of what you were saying:  were you not saying that Achilles was a true man, and Odysseus false and wily?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">100</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I was.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now do you perceive that the same person has turned out to be false as well as true?</div><div class="sentence"> If Odysseus is false he is also true, and if Achilles is true he is also false, and so the two men are not opposed to one another, but they are alike.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  O Socrates, you are always weaving the meshes of an argument, selecting the most difficult point, and fastening upon details instead of grappling with the matter in hand as a whole.</div><div class="sentence"> Come now, and I will demonstrate to you, if you will allow me, by many satisfactory proofs, that Homer has made Achilles a better man than Odysseus, and a truthful man too; and that he has made the other crafty, and a teller of many untruths, and inferior to Achilles.</div><div class="sentence"> And then, if you please, you shall make a speech on the other side, in order to prove that Odysseus is the better man; and this may be compared to mine, and then the company will know which of us is the better speaker.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">103</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  O Hippias, I do not doubt that you are wiser than I am.</div><div class="sentence"> But I have a way, when anybody else says anything, of giving close attention to him, especially if the speaker appears to me to be a wise man.</div><div class="sentence"> Having a desire to understand, I question him, and I examine and analyse and put together what he says, in order that I may understand; but if the speaker appears to me to be a poor hand, I do not interrogate him, or trouble myself about him, and you may know by this who they are whom I deem to be wise men, for you will see that when I am talking with a wise man, I am very attentive to what he says; and I ask questions of him, in order that I may learn, and be improved by him.</div><div class="sentence"> And I could not help remarking while you were speaking, that when you recited the verses in which Achilles, as you argued, attacks Odysseus as a deceiver, that you must be strangely mistaken, because Odysseus, the man of wiles, is never found to tell a lie; but Achilles is found to be wily on your own showing.</div><div class="sentence"> At any rate he speaks falsely; for first he utters these words, which you just now repeated,—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span> <div class="sentence">  'He is hateful to me even as the gates of death who thinks one thing and says another:'—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span> <div class="sentence">  And then he says, a little while afterwards, he will not be persuaded by Odysseus and Agamemnon, neither will he remain at Troy; but, says he,—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span> <div class="sentence">  'To-morrow, when I have offered sacrifices to Zeus and all the Gods, having loaded my ships well, I will drag them down into the deep; and then you shall see, if you have a mind, and if such things are a care to you, early in the morning my ships sailing over the fishy Hellespont, and my men eagerly plying the oar; and, if the illustrious shaker of the earth gives me a good voyage, on the third day I shall reach the fertile Phthia.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span> <div class="sentence">  And before that, when he was reviling Agamemnon, he said,—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span> <div class="sentence">  'And now to Phthia I will go, since to return home in the beaked ships is far better, nor am I inclined to stay here in dishonour and amass wealth and riches for you.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">109</span> <div class="sentence">  But although on that occasion, in the presence of the whole army, he spoke after this fashion, and on the other occasion to his companions, he appears never to have made any preparation or attempt to draw down the ships, as if he had the least intention of sailing home; so nobly regardless was he of the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> Now I, Hippias, originally asked you the question, because I was in doubt as to which of the two heroes was intended by the poet to be the best, and because I thought that both of them were the best, and that it would be difficult to decide which was the better of them, not only in respect of truth and falsehood, but of virtue generally, for even in this matter of speaking the truth they are much upon a par.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  There you are wrong, Socrates; for in so far as Achilles speaks falsely, the falsehood is obviously unintentional.</div><div class="sentence"> He is compelled against his will to remain and rescue the army in their misfortune.</div><div class="sentence"> But when Odysseus speaks falsely he is voluntarily and intentionally false.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">111</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You, sweet Hippias, like Odysseus, are a deceiver yourself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">112</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not, Socrates; what makes you say so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">113</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Because you say that Achilles does not speak falsely from design, when he is not only a deceiver, but besides being a braggart, in Homer's description of him is so cunning, and so far superior to Odysseus in lying and pretending, that he dares to contradict himself, and Odysseus does not find him out; at any rate he does not appear to say anything to him which would imply that he perceived his falsehood.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">114</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">115</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Did you not observe that afterwards, when he is speaking to Odysseus, he says that he will sail away with the early dawn; but to Ajax he tells quite a different story?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">116</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Where is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">117</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Where he says,—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">118</span> <div class="sentence">  'I will not think about bloody war until the son of warlike Priam, illustrious Hector, comes to the tents and ships of the Myrmidons, slaughtering the Argives, and burning the ships with fire; and about my tent and dark ship, I suspect that Hector, although eager for the battle, will nevertheless stay his hand.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">119</span> <div class="sentence">  Now, do you really think, Hippias, that the son of Thetis, who had been the pupil of the sage Cheiron, had such a bad memory, or would have carried the art of lying to such an extent (when he had been assailing liars in the most violent terms only the instant before) as to say to Odysseus that he would sail away, and to Ajax that he would remain, and that he was not rather practising upon the simplicity of Odysseus, whom he regarded as an ancient, and thinking that he would get the better of him by his own cunning and falsehood?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">120</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  No, I do not agree with you, Socrates; but I believe that Achilles is induced to say one thing to Ajax, and another to Odysseus in the innocence of his heart, whereas Odysseus, whether he speaks falsely or truly, speaks always with a purpose.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">121</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then Odysseus would appear after all to be better than Achilles?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">122</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">123</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, were not the voluntary liars only just now shown to be better than the involuntary?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">124</span><div class="speaker">HIPPIAS</div><div class="sentence">  And how, Socrates, can those who intentionally err, and voluntarily and designedly commit iniquities, be better than those who err and do wrong involuntarily?</div><div class="sentence"> Surely there is a great excuse to be made for a man telling a falsehood, or doing an injury or any sort of harm to another in ignorance.</div><div class="sentence"> And the laws are obviously far more severe on those who lie or do evil, voluntarily, than on those who do evil involuntarily.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">125</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You see, Hippias, as I have already told you, how pertinacious I am in asking questions of wise men.</div><div class="sentence"> And I think that this is the only good point about me, for I am full of defects, and always getting wrong in some way or other.</div><div class="sentence"> My deficiency is proved to me by the fact that when I meet one of you who are famous for wisdom, and to whose wisdom all the Hellenes are witnesses, I am found out to know nothing.</div><div class="sentence"> For speaking generally, I hardly ever have the same opinion about anything which you have, and what proof of ignorance can be greater than to differ from wise men?</div><div class="sentence"> But I have one singular good quality, which is my salvation; I am not ashamed to learn, and I ask and enquire, and am very grateful to those who answer me, and never fail to give them my grateful thanks; and when I learn a thing I never deny my teacher, or pretend that the lesson is a discovery of my own; but I praise his wisdom, and proclaim what I have learned from him.</div><div class="sentence"> And now I cannot agree in what you are saying, but I strongly disagree.</div><div class="sentence"> Well, I know that this is my own fault, and is a defect in my character, but I will not pretend to be more than I am; and my opinion, Hippias, is the very contrary of what you are saying.</div><div class="sentence"> For I maintain that those who hurt or injure mankind, and speak falsely and deceive, and err voluntarily, are better far than those who do wrong involuntarily.</div><div class="sentence"> Sometimes, however, I am of the opposite opinion; for I am all abroad in my ideas about this matter, a condition obviously occasioned by ignorance.</div><div class="sentence"> And just now I happen to be in a crisis of my disorder at which those who err voluntarily appear to me better than those who err involuntarily.</div><div class="sentence"> My present state of mind is due to our previous argument, which inclines me to believe that in general those who do wrong involuntarily are worse than those who do wrong voluntarily, and therefore I hope that you will be good to me, and not refuse to heal me; for you will do me a much greater benefit if you cure my soul of ignorance, than you would if you were to cure my body of disease.</div><div class="sentence"> I must, however, tell you beforehand, that if you make a long oration to me you will not cure me, for I shall not be able to follow you; but if you will answer me, as you did just now, you will do me a great deal of good, and I do not think that you will be any the worse yourself.</div><div class="sentence"> And I have some claim upon you also, O son of Apemantus, for you incited me to converse with Hippias; and now, if Hippias will not answer me, you must entreat him on my behalf.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">126</span><div class="speaker">EUDICUS</div><div class="sentence">  But I do not think, Socrates, that Hippias will require any entreaty of mine; for he has already said that he will refuse to answer no man.—Did you not say so, Hippias?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">129</span><div class="speaker">EUDICUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Hippias, do as he says; and for our sake, and also that you may not belie your profession, answer whatever Socrates asks you.</div></div>
