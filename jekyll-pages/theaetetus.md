<h2>INTRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  Some dialogues of Plato are of so various a character that their relation to the other dialogues cannot be determined with any degree of certainty.</div><div class="sentence"> The Theaetetus, like the Parmenides, has points of similarity both with his earlier and his later writings.</div><div class="sentence"> The perfection of style, the humour, the dramatic interest, the complexity of structure, the fertility of illustration, the shifting of the points of view, are characteristic of his best period of authorship.</div><div class="sentence"> The vain search, the negative conclusion, the figure of the midwives, the constant profession of ignorance on the part of Socrates, also bear the stamp of the early dialogues, in which the original Socrates is not yet Platonized.</div><div class="sentence"> Had we no other indications, we should be disposed to range the Theaetetus with the Apology and the Phaedrus, and perhaps even with the Protagoras and the Laches.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  But when we pass from the style to an examination of the subject, we trace a connection with the later rather than with the earlier dialogues.</div><div class="sentence"> In the first place there is the connexion, indicated by Plato himself at the end of the dialogue, with the Sophist, to which in many respects the Theaetetus is so little akin.</div><div class="sentence"> (1) The same persons reappear, including the younger Socrates, whose name is just mentioned in the Theaetetus; (2) the theory of rest, which Socrates has declined to consider, is resumed by the Eleatic Stranger; (3) there is a similar allusion in both dialogues to the meeting of Parmenides and Socrates (Theaet., Soph.</div><div class="sentence"> ); and (4) the inquiry into not-being in the Sophist supplements the question of false opinion which is raised in the Theaetetus.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare also Theaet.</div><div class="sentence"> and Soph.</div><div class="sentence"> for parallel turns of thought.)</div><div class="sentence"> Secondly, the later date of the dialogue is confirmed by the absence of the doctrine of recollection and of any doctrine of ideas except that which derives them from generalization and from reflection of the mind upon itself.</div><div class="sentence"> The general character of the Theaetetus is dialectical, and there are traces of the same Megarian influences which appear in the Parmenides, and which later writers, in their matter of fact way, have explained by the residence of Plato at Megara.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates disclaims the character of a professional eristic, and also, with a sort of ironical admiration, expresses his inability to attain the Megarian precision in the use of terms.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet he too employs a similar sophistical skill in overturning every conceivable theory of knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  The direct indications of a date amount to no more than this: the conversation is said to have taken place when Theaetetus was a youth, and shortly before the death of Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> At the time of his own death he is supposed to be a full-grown man.</div><div class="sentence"> Allowing nine or ten years for the interval between youth and manhood, the dialogue could not have been written earlier than 390, when Plato was about thirty-nine years of age.</div><div class="sentence"> No more definite date is indicated by the engagement in which Theaetetus is said to have fallen or to have been wounded, and which may have taken place any time during the Corinthian war, between the years 390-387.</div><div class="sentence"> The later date which has been suggested, 369, when the Athenians and Lacedaemonians disputed the Isthmus with Epaminondas, would make the age of Theaetetus at his death forty-five or forty-six.</div><div class="sentence"> This a little impairs the beauty of Socrates' remark, that 'he would be a great man if he lived.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  In this uncertainty about the place of the Theaetetus, it seemed better, as in the case of the Republic, Timaeus, Critias, to retain the order in which Plato himself has arranged this and the two companion dialogues.</div><div class="sentence"> We cannot exclude the possibility which has been already noticed in reference to other works of Plato, that the Theaetetus may not have been all written continuously; or the probability that the Sophist and Politicus, which differ greatly in style, were only appended after a long interval of time.</div><div class="sentence"> The allusion to Parmenides compared with the Sophist, would probably imply that the dialogue which is called by his name was already in existence; unless, indeed, we suppose the passage in which the allusion occurs to have been inserted afterwards.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, the Theaetetus may be connected with the Gorgias, either dialogue from different points of view containing an analysis of the real and apparent (Schleiermacher); and both may be brought into relation with the Apology as illustrating the personal life of Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> The Philebus, too, may with equal reason be placed either after or before what, in the language of Thrasyllus, may be called the Second Platonic Trilogy.</div><div class="sentence"> Both the Parmenides and the Sophist, and still more the Theaetetus, have points of affinity with the Cratylus, in which the principles of rest and motion are again contrasted, and the Sophistical or Protagorean theory of language is opposed to that which is attributed to the disciple of Heracleitus, not to speak of lesser resemblances in thought and language.</div><div class="sentence"> The Parmenides, again, has been thought by some to hold an intermediate position between the Theaetetus and the Sophist; upon this view, the Sophist may be regarded as the answer to the problems about One and Being which have been raised in the Parmenides.</div><div class="sentence"> Any of these arrangements may suggest new views to the student of Plato; none of them can lay claim to an exclusive probability in its favour.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  The Theaetetus is one of the narrated dialogues of Plato, and is the only one which is supposed to have been written down.</div><div class="sentence"> In a short introductory scene, Euclides and Terpsion are described as meeting before the door of Euclides' house in Megara.</div><div class="sentence"> This may have been a spot familiar to Plato (for Megara was within a walk of Athens), but no importance can be attached to the accidental introduction of the founder of the Megarian philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> The real intention of the preface is to create an interest about the person of Theaetetus, who has just been carried up from the army at Corinth in a dying state.</div><div class="sentence"> The expectation of his death recalls the promise of his youth, and especially the famous conversation which Socrates had with him when he was quite young, a few days before his own trial and death, as we are once more reminded at the end of the dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet we may observe that Plato has himself forgotten this, when he represents Euclides as from time to time coming to Athens and correcting the copy from Socrates' own mouth.</div><div class="sentence"> The narrative, having introduced Theaetetus, and having guaranteed the authenticity of the dialogue (compare Symposium, Phaedo, Parmenides), is then dropped.</div><div class="sentence"> No further use is made of the device.</div><div class="sentence"> As Plato himself remarks, who in this as in some other minute points is imitated by Cicero (De Amicitia), the interlocutory words are omitted.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  Theaetetus, the hero of the battle of Corinth and of the dialogue, is a disciple of Theodorus, the great geometrician, whose science is thus indicated to be the propaedeutic to philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> An interest has been already excited about him by his approaching death, and now he is introduced to us anew by the praises of his master Theodorus.</div><div class="sentence"> He is a youthful Socrates, and exhibits the same contrast of the fair soul and the ungainly face and frame, the Silenus mask and the god within, which are described in the Symposium.</div><div class="sentence"> The picture which Theodorus gives of his courage and patience and intelligence and modesty is verified in the course of the dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> His courage is shown by his behaviour in the battle, and his other qualities shine forth as the argument proceeds.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates takes an evident delight in 'the wise Theaetetus,' who has more in him than 'many bearded men'; he is quite inspired by his answers.</div><div class="sentence"> At first the youth is lost in wonder, and is almost too modest to speak, but, encouraged by Socrates, he rises to the occasion, and grows full of interest and enthusiasm about the great question.</div><div class="sentence"> Like a youth, he has not finally made up his mind, and is very ready to follow the lead of Socrates, and to enter into each successive phase of the discussion which turns up.</div><div class="sentence"> His great dialectical talent is shown in his power of drawing distinctions, and of foreseeing the consequences of his own answers.</div><div class="sentence"> The enquiry about the nature of knowledge is not new to him; long ago he has felt the 'pang of philosophy,' and has experienced the youthful intoxication which is depicted in the Philebus.</div><div class="sentence"> But he has hitherto been unable to make the transition from mathematics to metaphysics.</div><div class="sentence"> He can form a general conception of square and oblong numbers, but he is unable to attain a similar expression of knowledge in the abstract.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet at length he begins to recognize that there are universal conceptions of being, likeness, sameness, number, which the mind contemplates in herself, and with the help of Socrates is conducted from a theory of sense to a theory of ideas.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  There is no reason to doubt that Theaetetus was a real person, whose name survived in the next generation.</div><div class="sentence"> But neither can any importance be attached to the notices of him in Suidas and Proclus, which are probably based on the mention of him in Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> According to a confused statement in Suidas, who mentions him twice over, first, as a pupil of Socrates, and then of Plato, he is said to have written the first work on the Five Solids.</div><div class="sentence"> But no early authority cites the work, the invention of which may have been easily suggested by the division of roots, which Plato attributes to him, and the allusion to the backward state of solid geometry in the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> At any rate, there is no occasion to recall him to life again after the battle of Corinth, in order that we may allow time for the completion of such a work (Muller).</div><div class="sentence"> We may also remark that such a supposition entirely destroys the pathetic interest of the introduction.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  Theodorus, the geometrician, had once been the friend and disciple of Protagoras, but he is very reluctant to leave his retirement and defend his old master.</div><div class="sentence"> He is too old to learn Socrates' game of question and answer, and prefers the digressions to the main argument, because he finds them easier to follow.</div><div class="sentence"> The mathematician, as Socrates says in the Republic, is not capable of giving a reason in the same manner as the dialectician, and Theodorus could not therefore have been appropriately introduced as the chief respondent.</div><div class="sentence"> But he may be fairly appealed to, when the honour of his master is at stake.</div><div class="sentence"> He is the 'guardian of his orphans,' although this is a responsibility which he wishes to throw upon Callias, the friend and patron of all Sophists, declaring that he himself had early 'run away' from philosophy, and was absorbed in mathematics.</div><div class="sentence"> His extreme dislike to the Heraclitean fanatics, which may be compared with the dislike of Theaetetus to the materialists, and his ready acceptance of the noble words of Socrates, are noticeable traits of character.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span> <div class="sentence">  The Socrates of the Theaetetus is the same as the Socrates of the earlier dialogues.</div><div class="sentence"> He is the invincible disputant, now advanced in years, of the Protagoras and Symposium; he is still pursuing his divine mission, his 'Herculean labours,' of which he has described the origin in the Apology; and he still hears the voice of his oracle, bidding him receive or not receive the truant souls.</div><div class="sentence"> There he is supposed to have a mission to convict men of self-conceit; in the Theaetetus he has assigned to him by God the functions of a man-midwife, who delivers men of their thoughts, and under this character he is present throughout the dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> He is the true prophet who has an insight into the natures of men, and can divine their future; and he knows that sympathy is the secret power which unlocks their thoughts.</div><div class="sentence"> The hit at Aristides, the son of Lysimachus, who was specially committed to his charge in the Laches, may be remarked by the way.</div><div class="sentence"> The attempt to discover the definition of knowledge is in accordance with the character of Socrates as he is described in the Memorabilia, asking What is justice?</div><div class="sentence"> what is temperance?</div><div class="sentence"> and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> But there is no reason to suppose that he would have analyzed the nature of perception, or traced the connexion of Protagoras and Heracleitus, or have raised the difficulty respecting false opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> The humorous illustrations, as well as the serious thoughts, run through the dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> The snubnosedness of Theaetetus, a characteristic which he shares with Socrates, and the man-midwifery of Socrates, are not forgotten in the closing words.</div><div class="sentence"> At the end of the dialogue, as in the Euthyphro, he is expecting to meet Meletus at the porch of the king Archon; but with the same indifference to the result which is everywhere displayed by him, he proposes that they shall reassemble on the following day at the same spot.</div><div class="sentence"> The day comes, and in the Sophist the three friends again meet, but no further allusion is made to the trial, and the principal share in the argument is assigned, not to Socrates, but to an Eleatic stranger; the youthful Theaetetus also plays a different and less independent part.</div><div class="sentence"> And there is no allusion in the Introduction to the second and third dialogues, which are afterwards appended.</div><div class="sentence"> There seems, therefore, reason to think that there is a real change, both in the characters and in the design.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span> <div class="sentence">  The dialogue is an enquiry into the nature of knowledge, which is interrupted by two digressions.</div><div class="sentence"> The first is the digression about the midwives, which is also a leading thought or continuous image, like the wave in the Republic, appearing and reappearing at intervals.</div><div class="sentence"> Again and again we are reminded that the successive conceptions of knowledge are extracted from Theaetetus, who in his turn truly declares that Socrates has got a great deal more out of him than ever was in him.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates is never weary of working out the image in humorous details,—discerning the symptoms of labour, carrying the child round the hearth, fearing that Theaetetus will bite him, comparing his conceptions to wind-eggs, asserting an hereditary right to the occupation.</div><div class="sentence"> There is also a serious side to the image, which is an apt similitude of the Socratic theory of education (compare Republic, Sophist), and accords with the ironical spirit in which the wisest of men delights to speak of himself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span> <div class="sentence">  The other digression is the famous contrast of the lawyer and philosopher.</div><div class="sentence"> This is a sort of landing-place or break in the middle of the dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> At the commencement of a great discussion, the reflection naturally arises, How happy are they who, like the philosopher, have time for such discussions (compare Republic)!</div><div class="sentence"> There is no reason for the introduction of such a digression; nor is a reason always needed, any more than for the introduction of an episode in a poem, or of a topic in conversation.</div><div class="sentence"> That which is given by Socrates is quite sufficient, viz.</div><div class="sentence"> that the philosopher may talk and write as he pleases.</div><div class="sentence"> But though not very closely connected, neither is the digression out of keeping with the rest of the dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> The philosopher naturally desires to pour forth the thoughts which are always present to him, and to discourse of the higher life.</div><div class="sentence"> The idea of knowledge, although hard to be defined, is realised in the life of philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> And the contrast is the favourite antithesis between the world, in the various characters of sophist, lawyer, statesman, speaker, and the philosopher,—between opinion and knowledge,—between the conventional and the true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span> <div class="sentence">  The greater part of the dialogue is devoted to setting up and throwing down definitions of science and knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> Proceeding from the lower to the higher by three stages, in which perception, opinion, reasoning are successively examined, we first get rid of the confusion of the idea of knowledge and specific kinds of knowledge,—a confusion which has been already noticed in the Lysis, Laches, Meno, and other dialogues.</div><div class="sentence"> In the infancy of logic, a form of thought has to be invented before the content can be filled up.</div><div class="sentence"> We cannot define knowledge until the nature of definition has been ascertained.</div><div class="sentence"> Having succeeded in making his meaning plain, Socrates proceeds to analyze (1) the first definition which Theaetetus proposes: 'Knowledge is sensible perception.'</div><div class="sentence"> This is speedily identified with the Protagorean saying, 'Man is the measure of all things;' and of this again the foundation is discovered in the perpetual flux of Heracleitus.</div><div class="sentence"> The relativeness of sensation is then developed at length, and for a moment the definition appears to be accepted.</div><div class="sentence"> But soon the Protagorean thesis is pronounced to be suicidal; for the adversaries of Protagoras are as good a measure as he is, and they deny his doctrine.</div><div class="sentence"> He is then supposed to reply that the perception may be true at any given instant.</div><div class="sentence"> But the reply is in the end shown to be inconsistent with the Heraclitean foundation, on which the doctrine has been affirmed to rest.</div><div class="sentence"> For if the Heraclitean flux is extended to every sort of change in every instant of time, how can any thought or word be detained even for an instant?</div><div class="sentence"> Sensible perception, like everything else, is tumbling to pieces.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor can Protagoras himself maintain that one man is as good as another in his knowledge of the future; and 'the expedient,' if not 'the just and true,' belongs to the sphere of the future.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span> <div class="sentence">  And so we must ask again, What is knowledge?</div><div class="sentence"> The comparison of sensations with one another implies a principle which is above sensation, and which resides in the mind itself.</div><div class="sentence"> We are thus led to look for knowledge in a higher sphere, and accordingly Theaetetus, when again interrogated, replies (2) that 'knowledge is true opinion.'</div><div class="sentence"> But how is false opinion possible?</div><div class="sentence"> The Megarian or Eristic spirit within us revives the question, which has been already asked and indirectly answered in the Meno: 'How can a man be ignorant of that which he knows?'</div><div class="sentence"> No answer is given to this not unanswerable question.</div><div class="sentence"> The comparison of the mind to a block of wax, or to a decoy of birds, is found wanting.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span> <div class="sentence">  But are we not inverting the natural order in looking for opinion before we have found knowledge?</div><div class="sentence"> And knowledge is not true opinion; for the Athenian dicasts have true opinion but not knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> What then is knowledge?</div><div class="sentence"> We answer (3), 'True opinion, with definition or explanation.'</div><div class="sentence"> But all the different ways in which this statement may be understood are set aside, like the definitions of courage in the Laches, or of friendship in the Lysis, or of temperance in the Charmides.</div><div class="sentence"> At length we arrive at the conclusion, in which nothing is concluded.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span> <div class="sentence">  There are two special difficulties which beset the student of the Theaetetus: (1) he is uncertain how far he can trust Plato's account of the theory of Protagoras; and he is also uncertain (2) how far, and in what parts of the dialogue, Plato is expressing his own opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> The dramatic character of the work renders the answer to both these questions difficult.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span> <div class="sentence">  1.</div><div class="sentence"> In reply to the first, we have only probabilities to offer.</div><div class="sentence"> Three main points have to be decided: (a) Would Protagoras have identified his own thesis, 'Man is the measure of all things,' with the other, 'All knowledge is sensible perception'?</div><div class="sentence"> (b) Would he have based the relativity of knowledge on the Heraclitean flux?</div><div class="sentence"> (c) Would he have asserted the absoluteness of sensation at each instant?</div><div class="sentence"> Of the work of Protagoras on 'Truth' we know nothing, with the exception of the two famous fragments, which are cited in this dialogue, 'Man is the measure of all things,' and, 'Whether there are gods or not, I cannot tell.'</div><div class="sentence"> Nor have we any other trustworthy evidence of the tenets of Protagoras, or of the sense in which his words are used.</div><div class="sentence"> For later writers, including Aristotle in his Metaphysics, have mixed up the Protagoras of Plato, as they have the Socrates of Plato, with the real person.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span> <div class="sentence">  Returning then to the Theaetetus, as the only possible source from which an answer to these questions can be obtained, we may remark, that Plato had 'The Truth' of Protagoras before him, and frequently refers to the book.</div><div class="sentence"> He seems to say expressly, that in this work the doctrine of the Heraclitean flux was not to be found; 'he told the real truth' (not in the book, which is so entitled, but) 'privately to his disciples,'—words which imply that the connexion between the doctrines of Protagoras and Heracleitus was not generally recognized in Greece, but was really discovered or invented by Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, the doctrine that 'Man is the measure of all things,' is expressly identified by Socrates with the other statement, that 'What appears to each man is to him;' and a reference is made to the books in which the statement occurs;—this Theaetetus, who has 'often read the books,' is supposed to acknowledge (so Cratylus).</div><div class="sentence"> And Protagoras, in the speech attributed to him, never says that he has been misunderstood: he rather seems to imply that the absoluteness of sensation at each instant was to be found in his words.</div><div class="sentence"> He is only indignant at the 'reductio ad absurdum' devised by Socrates for his 'homo mensura,' which Theodorus also considers to be 'really too bad.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span> <div class="sentence">  The question may be raised, how far Plato in the Theaetetus could have misrepresented Protagoras without violating the laws of dramatic probability.</div><div class="sentence"> Could he have pretended to cite from a well-known writing what was not to be found there?</div><div class="sentence"> But such a shadowy enquiry is not worth pursuing further.</div><div class="sentence"> We need only remember that in the criticism which follows of the thesis of Protagoras, we are criticizing the Protagoras of Plato, and not attempting to draw a precise line between his real sentiments and those which Plato has attributed to him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span> <div class="sentence">  2.</div><div class="sentence"> The other difficulty is a more subtle, and also a more important one, because bearing on the general character of the Platonic dialogues.</div><div class="sentence"> On a first reading of them, we are apt to imagine that the truth is only spoken by Socrates, who is never guilty of a fallacy himself, and is the great detector of the errors and fallacies of others.</div><div class="sentence"> But this natural presumption is disturbed by the discovery that the Sophists are sometimes in the right and Socrates in the wrong.</div><div class="sentence"> Like the hero of a novel, he is not to be supposed always to represent the sentiments of the author.</div><div class="sentence"> There are few modern readers who do not side with Protagoras, rather than with Socrates, in the dialogue which is called by his name.</div><div class="sentence"> The Cratylus presents a similar difficulty: in his etymologies, as in the number of the State, we cannot tell how far Socrates is serious; for the Socratic irony will not allow him to distinguish between his real and his assumed wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> No one is the superior of the invincible Socrates in argument (except in the first part of the Parmenides, where he is introduced as a youth); but he is by no means supposed to be in possession of the whole truth.</div><div class="sentence"> Arguments are often put into his mouth (compare Introduction to the Gorgias) which must have seemed quite as untenable to Plato as to a modern writer.</div><div class="sentence"> In this dialogue a great part of the answer of Protagoras is just and sound; remarks are made by him on verbal criticism, and on the importance of understanding an opponent's meaning, which are conceived in the true spirit of philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> And the distinction which he is supposed to draw between Eristic and Dialectic, is really a criticism of Plato on himself and his own criticism of Protagoras.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span> <div class="sentence">  The difficulty seems to arise from not attending to the dramatic character of the writings of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> There are two, or more, sides to questions; and these are parted among the different speakers.</div><div class="sentence"> Sometimes one view or aspect of a question is made to predominate over the rest, as in the Gorgias or Sophist; but in other dialogues truth is divided, as in the Laches and Protagoras, and the interest of the piece consists in the contrast of opinions.</div><div class="sentence"> The confusion caused by the irony of Socrates, who, if he is true to his character, cannot say anything of his own knowledge, is increased by the circumstance that in the Theaetetus and some other dialogues he is occasionally playing both parts himself, and even charging his own arguments with unfairness.</div><div class="sentence"> In the Theaetetus he is designedly held back from arriving at a conclusion.</div><div class="sentence"> For we cannot suppose that Plato conceived a definition of knowledge to be impossible.</div><div class="sentence"> But this is his manner of approaching and surrounding a question.</div><div class="sentence"> The lights which he throws on his subject are indirect, but they are not the less real for that.</div><div class="sentence"> He has no intention of proving a thesis by a cut-and-dried argument; nor does he imagine that a great philosophical problem can be tied up within the limits of a definition.</div><div class="sentence"> If he has analyzed a proposition or notion, even with the severity of an impossible logic, if half-truths have been compared by him with other half-truths, if he has cleared up or advanced popular ideas, or illustrated a new method, his aim has been sufficiently accomplished.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span> <div class="sentence">  The writings of Plato belong to an age in which the power of analysis had outrun the means of knowledge; and through a spurious use of dialectic, the distinctions which had been already 'won from the void and formless infinite,' seemed to be rapidly returning to their original chaos.</div><div class="sentence"> The two great speculative philosophies, which a century earlier had so deeply impressed the mind of Hellas, were now degenerating into Eristic.</div><div class="sentence"> The contemporaries of Plato and Socrates were vainly trying to find new combinations of them, or to transfer them from the object to the subject.</div><div class="sentence"> The Megarians, in their first attempts to attain a severer logic, were making knowledge impossible (compare Theaet.).</div><div class="sentence"> They were asserting 'the one good under many names,' and, like the Cynics, seem to have denied predication, while the Cynics themselves were depriving virtue of all which made virtue desirable in the eyes of Socrates and Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> And besides these, we find mention in the later writings of Plato, especially in the Theaetetus, Sophist, and Laws, of certain impenetrable godless persons, who will not believe what they 'cannot hold in their hands'; and cannot be approached in argument, because they cannot argue (Theat; Soph.).</div><div class="sentence"> No school of Greek philosophers exactly answers to these persons, in whom Plato may perhaps have blended some features of the Atomists with the vulgar materialistic tendencies of mankind in general (compare Introduction to the Sophist).</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">083</span> <div class="sentence">  The theory that 'Knowledge is sensible perception' is the antithesis of that which derives knowledge from the mind (Theaet.</div><div class="sentence"> ), or which assumes the existence of ideas independent of the mind (Parm.).</div><div class="sentence"> Yet from their extreme abstraction these theories do not represent the opposite poles of thought in the same way that the corresponding differences would in modern philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> The most ideal and the most sensational have a tendency to pass into one another; Heracleitus, like his great successor Hegel, has both aspects.</div><div class="sentence"> The Eleatic isolation of Being and the Megarian or Cynic isolation of individuals are placed in the same class by Plato (Soph.</div><div class="sentence"> ); and the same principle which is the symbol of motion to one mind is the symbol of rest to another.</div><div class="sentence"> The Atomists, who are sometimes regarded as the Materialists of Plato, denied the reality of sensation.</div><div class="sentence"> And in the ancient as well as the modern world there were reactions from theory to experience, from ideas to sense.</div><div class="sentence"> This is a point of view from which the philosophy of sensation presented great attraction to the ancient thinker.</div><div class="sentence"> Amid the conflict of ideas and the variety of opinions, the impression of sense remained certain and uniform.</div><div class="sentence"> Hardness, softness, cold, heat, etc.</div><div class="sentence"> are not absolutely the same to different persons, but the art of measuring could at any rate reduce them all to definite natures (Republic).</div><div class="sentence"> Thus the doctrine that knowledge is perception supplies or seems to supply a firm standing ground.</div><div class="sentence"> Like the other notions of the earlier Greek philosophy, it was held in a very simple way, without much basis of reasoning, and without suggesting the questions which naturally arise in our own minds on the same subject.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">086</span> <div class="sentence">  These two questions have not been always clearly distinguished; the relativity of knowledge has been sometimes confounded with uncertainty.</div><div class="sentence"> The untutored mind is apt to suppose that objects exist independently of the human faculties, because they really exist independently of the faculties of any individual.</div><div class="sentence"> In the same way, knowledge appears to be a body of truths stored up in books, which when once ascertained are independent of the discoverer.</div><div class="sentence"> Further consideration shows us that these truths are not really independent of the mind; there is an adaptation of one to the other, of the eye to the object of sense, of the mind to the conception.</div><div class="sentence"> There would be no world, if there neither were nor ever had been any one to perceive the world.</div><div class="sentence"> A slight effort of reflection enables us to understand this; but no effort of reflection will enable us to pass beyond the limits of our own faculties, or to imagine the relation or adaptation of objects to the mind to be different from that of which we have experience.</div><div class="sentence"> There are certain laws of language and logic to which we are compelled to conform, and to which our ideas naturally adapt themselves; and we can no more get rid of them than we can cease to be ourselves.</div><div class="sentence"> The absolute and infinite, whether explained as self-existence, or as the totality of human thought, or as the Divine nature, if known to us at all, cannot escape from the category of relation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span> <div class="sentence">  But because knowledge is subjective or relative to the mind, we are not to suppose that we are therefore deprived of any of the tests or criteria of truth.</div><div class="sentence"> One man still remains wiser than another, a more accurate observer and relater of facts, a truer measure of the proportions of knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> The nature of testimony is not altered, nor the verification of causes by prescribed methods less certain.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, the truth must often come to a man through others, according to the measure of his capacity and education.</div><div class="sentence"> But neither does this affect the testimony, whether written or oral, which he knows by experience to be trustworthy.</div><div class="sentence"> He cannot escape from the laws of his own mind; and he cannot escape from the further accident of being dependent for his knowledge on others.</div><div class="sentence"> But still this is no reason why he should always be in doubt; of many personal, of many historical and scientific facts he may be absolutely assured.</div><div class="sentence"> And having such a mass of acknowledged truth in the mathematical and physical, not to speak of the moral sciences, the moderns have certainly no reason to acquiesce in the statement that truth is appearance only, or that there is no difference between appearance and truth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">088</span> <div class="sentence">  The relativity of knowledge is a truism to us, but was a great psychological discovery in the fifth century before Christ.</div><div class="sentence"> Of this discovery, the first distinct assertion is contained in the thesis of Protagoras.</div><div class="sentence"> Probably he had no intention either of denying or affirming an objective standard of truth.</div><div class="sentence"> He did not consider whether man in the higher or man in the lower sense was a 'measure of all things.'</div><div class="sentence"> Like other great thinkers, he was absorbed with one idea, and that idea was the absoluteness of perception.</div><div class="sentence"> Like Socrates, he seemed to see that philosophy must be brought back from 'nature' to 'truth,' from the world to man.</div><div class="sentence"> But he did not stop to analyze whether he meant 'man' in the concrete or man in the abstract, any man or some men, 'quod semper quod ubique' or individual private judgment.</div><div class="sentence"> Such an analysis lay beyond his sphere of thought; the age before Socrates had not arrived at these distinctions.</div><div class="sentence"> Like the Cynics, again, he discarded knowledge in any higher sense than perception.</div><div class="sentence"> For 'truer' or 'wiser' he substituted the word 'better,' and is not unwilling to admit that both states and individuals are capable of practical improvement.</div><div class="sentence"> But this improvement does not arise from intellectual enlightenment, nor yet from the exertion of the will, but from a change of circumstances and impressions; and he who can effect this change in himself or others may be deemed a philosopher.</div><div class="sentence"> In the mode of effecting it, while agreeing with Socrates and the Cynics in the importance which he attaches to practical life, he is at variance with both of them.</div><div class="sentence"> To suppose that practice can be divorced from speculation, or that we may do good without caring about truth, is by no means singular, either in philosophy or life.</div><div class="sentence"> The singularity of this, as of some other (so-called) sophistical doctrines, is the frankness with which they are avowed, instead of being veiled, as in modern times, under ambiguous and convenient phrases.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span> <div class="sentence">  Plato appears to treat Protagoras much as he himself is treated by Aristotle; that is to say, he does not attempt to understand him from his own point of view.</div><div class="sentence"> But he entangles him in the meshes of a more advanced logic.</div><div class="sentence"> To which Protagoras is supposed to reply by Megarian quibbles, which destroy logic, 'Not only man, but each man, and each man at each moment.'</div><div class="sentence"> In the arguments about sight and memory there is a palpable unfairness which is worthy of the great 'brainless brothers,' Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, and may be compared with the egkekalummenos ('obvelatus') of Eubulides.</div><div class="sentence"> For he who sees with one eye only cannot be truly said both to see and not to see; nor is memory, which is liable to forget, the immediate knowledge to which Protagoras applies the term.</div><div class="sentence"> Theodorus justly charges Socrates with going beyond the truth; and Protagoras has equally right on his side when he protests against Socrates arguing from the common use of words, which 'the vulgar pervert in all manner of ways.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span> <div class="sentence">  III.</div><div class="sentence"> The theory of Protagoras is connected by Aristotle as well as Plato with the flux of Heracleitus.</div><div class="sentence"> But Aristotle is only following Plato, and Plato, as we have already seen, did not mean to imply that such a connexion was admitted by Protagoras himself.</div><div class="sentence"> His metaphysical genius saw or seemed to see a common tendency in them, just as the modern historian of ancient philosophy might perceive a parallelism between two thinkers of which they were probably unconscious themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> We must remember throughout that Plato is not speaking of Heracleitus, but of the Heracliteans, who succeeded him; nor of the great original ideas of the master, but of the Eristic into which they had degenerated a hundred years later.</div><div class="sentence"> There is nothing in the fragments of Heracleitus which at all justifies Plato's account of him.</div><div class="sentence"> His philosophy may be resolved into two elements—first, change, secondly, law or measure pervading the change: these he saw everywhere, and often expressed in strange mythological symbols.</div><div class="sentence"> But he has no analysis of sensible perception such as Plato attributes to him; nor is there any reason to suppose that he pushed his philosophy into that absolute negation in which Heracliteanism was sunk in the age of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> He never said that 'change means every sort of change;' and he expressly distinguished between 'the general and particular understanding.'</div><div class="sentence"> Like a poet, he surveyed the elements of mythology, nature, thought, which lay before him, and sometimes by the light of genius he saw or seemed to see a mysterious principle working behind them.</div><div class="sentence"> But as has been the case with other great philosophers, and with Plato and Aristotle themselves, what was really permanent and original could not be understood by the next generation, while a perverted logic carried out his chance expressions with an illogical consistency.</div><div class="sentence"> His simple and noble thoughts, like those of the great Eleatic, soon degenerated into a mere strife of words.</div><div class="sentence"> And when thus reduced to mere words, they seem to have exercised a far wider influence in the cities of Ionia (where the people 'were mad about them') than in the life-time of Heracleitus—a phenomenon which, though at first sight singular, is not without a parallel in the history of philosophy and theology.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span> <div class="sentence">  It is this perverted form of the Heraclitean philosophy which is supposed to effect the final overthrow of Protagorean sensationalism.</div><div class="sentence"> For if all things are changing at every moment, in all sorts of ways, then there is nothing fixed or defined at all, and therefore no sensible perception, nor any true word by which that or anything else can be described.</div><div class="sentence"> Of course Protagoras would not have admitted the justice of this argument any more than Heracleitus would have acknowledged the 'uneducated fanatics' who appealed to his writings.</div><div class="sentence"> He might have said, 'The excellent Socrates has first confused me with Heracleitus, and Heracleitus with his Ephesian successors, and has then disproved the existence both of knowledge and sensation.</div><div class="sentence"> But I am not responsible for what I never said, nor will I admit that my common-sense account of knowledge can be overthrown by unintelligible Heraclitean paradoxes.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span> <div class="sentence">  IV.</div><div class="sentence"> Still at the bottom of the arguments there remains a truth, that knowledge is something more than sensible perception;—this alone would not distinguish man from a tadpole.</div><div class="sentence"> The absoluteness of sensations at each moment destroys the very consciousness of sensations (compare Phileb.</div><div class="sentence"> ), or the power of comparing them.</div><div class="sentence"> The senses are not mere holes in a 'Trojan horse,' but the organs of a presiding nature, in which they meet.</div><div class="sentence"> A great advance has been made in psychology when the senses are recognized as organs of sense, and we are admitted to see or feel 'through them' and not 'by them,' a distinction of words which, as Socrates observes, is by no means pedantic.</div><div class="sentence"> A still further step has been made when the most abstract notions, such as Being and Not-being, sameness and difference, unity and plurality, are acknowledged to be the creations of the mind herself, working upon the feelings or impressions of sense.</div><div class="sentence"> In this manner Plato describes the process of acquiring them, in the words 'Knowledge consists not in the feelings or affections (pathemasi), but in the process of reasoning about them (sullogismo).'</div><div class="sentence"> Here, is in the Parmenides, he means something not really different from generalization.</div><div class="sentence"> As in the Sophist, he is laying the foundation of a rational psychology, which is to supersede the Platonic reminiscence of Ideas as well as the Eleatic Being and the individualism of Megarians and Cynics.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">093</span> <div class="sentence">  V. Having rejected the doctrine that 'Knowledge is perception,' we now proceed to look for a definition of knowledge in the sphere of opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> But here we are met by a singular difficulty: How is false opinion possible?</div><div class="sentence"> For we must either know or not know that which is presented to the mind or to sense.</div><div class="sentence"> We of course should answer at once: 'No; the alternative is not necessary, for there may be degrees of knowledge; and we may know and have forgotten, or we may be learning, or we may have a general but not a particular knowledge, or we may know but not be able to explain;' and many other ways may be imagined in which we know and do not know at the same time.</div><div class="sentence"> But these answers belong to a later stage of metaphysical discussion; whereas the difficulty in question naturally arises owing to the childhood of the human mind, like the parallel difficulty respecting Not-being.</div><div class="sentence"> Men had only recently arrived at the notion of opinion; they could not at once define the true and pass beyond into the false.</div><div class="sentence"> The very word doxa was full of ambiguity, being sometimes, as in the Eleatic philosophy, applied to the sensible world, and again used in the more ordinary sense of opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no connexion between sensible appearance and probability, and yet both of them met in the word doxa, and could hardly be disengaged from one another in the mind of the Greek living in the fifth or fourth century B.C.</div><div class="sentence"> To this was often added, as at the end of the fifth book of the Republic, the idea of relation, which is equally distinct from either of them; also a fourth notion, the conclusion of the dialectical process, the making up of the mind after she has been 'talking to herself' (Theat.</div><div class="sentence"> ).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span> <div class="sentence">  We are not then surprised that the sphere of opinion and of Not-being should be a dusky, half-lighted place (Republic), belonging neither to the old world of sense and imagination, nor to the new world of reflection and reason.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato attempts to clear up this darkness.</div><div class="sentence"> In his accustomed manner he passes from the lower to the higher, without omitting the intermediate stages.</div><div class="sentence"> This appears to be the reason why he seeks for the definition of knowledge first in the sphere of opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> Hereafter we shall find that something more than opinion is required.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span> <div class="sentence">  False opinion is explained by Plato at first as a confusion of mind and sense, which arises when the impression on the mind does not correspond to the impression made on the senses.</div><div class="sentence"> It is obvious that this explanation (supposing the distinction between impressions on the mind and impressions on the senses to be admitted) does not account for all forms of error; and Plato has excluded himself from the consideration of the greater number, by designedly omitting the intermediate processes of learning and forgetting; nor does he include fallacies in the use of language or erroneous inferences.</div><div class="sentence"> But he is struck by one possibility of error, which is not covered by his theory, viz.</div><div class="sentence"> errors in arithmetic.</div><div class="sentence"> For in numbers and calculation there is no combination of thought and sense, and yet errors may often happen.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence he is led to discard the explanation which might nevertheless have been supposed to hold good (for anything which he says to the contrary) as a rationale of error, in the case of facts derived from sense.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span> <div class="sentence">  Another attempt is made to explain false opinion by assigning to error a sort of positive existence.</div><div class="sentence"> But error or ignorance is essentially negative—a not-knowing; if we knew an error, we should be no longer in error.</div><div class="sentence"> We may veil our difficulty under figures of speech, but these, although telling arguments with the multitude, can never be the real foundation of a system of psychology.</div><div class="sentence"> Only they lead us to dwell upon mental phenomena which if expressed in an abstract form would not be realized by us at all.</div><div class="sentence"> The figure of the mind receiving impressions is one of those images which have rooted themselves for ever in language.</div><div class="sentence"> It may or may not be a 'gracious aid' to thought; but it cannot be got rid of.</div><div class="sentence"> The other figure of the enclosure is also remarkable as affording the first hint of universal all-pervading ideas,—a notion further carried out in the Sophist.</div><div class="sentence"> This is implied in the birds, some in flocks, some solitary, which fly about anywhere and everywhere.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato discards both figures, as not really solving the question which to us appears so simple: 'How do we make mistakes?'</div><div class="sentence"> The failure of the enquiry seems to show that we should return to knowledge, and begin with that; and we may afterwards proceed, with a better hope of success, to the examination of opinion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span> <div class="sentence">  But is true opinion really distinct from knowledge?</div><div class="sentence"> The difference between these he seeks to establish by an argument, which to us appears singular and unsatisfactory.</div><div class="sentence"> The existence of true opinion is proved by the rhetoric of the law courts, which cannot give knowledge, but may give true opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> The rhetorician cannot put the judge or juror in possession of all the facts which prove an act of violence, but he may truly persuade them of the commission of such an act.</div><div class="sentence"> Here the idea of true opinion seems to be a right conclusion from imperfect knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> But the correctness of such an opinion will be purely accidental; and is really the effect of one man, who has the means of knowing, persuading another who has not.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato would have done better if he had said that true opinion was a contradiction in terms.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">098</span> <div class="sentence">  Assuming the distinction between knowledge and opinion, Theaetetus, in answer to Socrates, proceeds to define knowledge as true opinion, with definite or rational explanation.</div><div class="sentence"> This Socrates identifies with another and different theory, of those who assert that knowledge first begins with a proposition.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span> <div class="sentence">  The elements may be perceived by sense, but they are names, and cannot be defined.</div><div class="sentence"> When we assign to them some predicate, they first begin to have a meaning (onomaton sumploke logou ousia).</div><div class="sentence"> This seems equivalent to saying, that the individuals of sense become the subject of knowledge when they are regarded as they are in nature in relation to other individuals.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">100</span> <div class="sentence">  Yet we feel a difficulty in following this new hypothesis.</div><div class="sentence"> For must not opinion be equally expressed in a proposition?</div><div class="sentence"> The difference between true and false opinion is not the difference between the particular and the universal, but between the true universal and the false.</div><div class="sentence"> Thought may be as much at fault as sight.</div><div class="sentence"> When we place individuals under a class, or assign to them attributes, this is not knowledge, but a very rudimentary process of thought; the first generalization of all, without which language would be impossible.</div><div class="sentence"> And has Plato kept altogether clear of a confusion, which the analogous word logos tends to create, of a proposition and a definition?</div><div class="sentence"> And is not the confusion increased by the use of the analogous term 'elements,' or 'letters'?</div><div class="sentence"> For there is no real resemblance between the relation of letters to a syllable, and of the terms to a proposition.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span> <div class="sentence">  Plato, in the spirit of the Megarian philosophy, soon discovers a flaw in the explanation.</div><div class="sentence"> For how can we know a compound of which the simple elements are unknown to us?</div><div class="sentence"> Can two unknowns make a known?</div><div class="sentence"> Can a whole be something different from the parts?</div><div class="sentence"> The answer of experience is that they can; for we may know a compound, which we are unable to analyze into its elements; and all the parts, when united, may be more than all the parts separated: e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> the number four, or any other number, is more than the units which are contained in it; any chemical compound is more than and different from the simple elements.</div><div class="sentence"> But ancient philosophy in this, as in many other instances, proceeding by the path of mental analysis, was perplexed by doubts which warred against the plainest facts.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span> <div class="sentence">  A profusion of words and ideas has obscured rather than enlightened mental science.</div><div class="sentence"> It is hard to say how many fallacies have arisen from the representation of the mind as a box, as a 'tabula rasa,' a book, a mirror, and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> It is remarkable how Plato in the Theaetetus, after having indulged in the figure of the waxen tablet and the decoy, afterwards discards them.</div><div class="sentence"> The mind is also represented by another class of images, as the spring of a watch, a motive power, a breath, a stream, a succession of points or moments.</div><div class="sentence"> As Plato remarks in the Cratylus, words expressive of motion as well as of rest are employed to describe the faculties and operations of the mind; and in these there is contained another store of fallacies.</div><div class="sentence"> Some shadow or reflection of the body seems always to adhere to our thoughts about ourselves, and mental processes are hardly distinguished in language from bodily ones.</div><div class="sentence"> To see or perceive are used indifferently of both; the words intuition, moral sense, common sense, the mind's eye, are figures of speech transferred from one to the other.</div><div class="sentence"> And many other words used in early poetry or in sacred writings to express the works of mind have a materialistic sound; for old mythology was allied to sense, and the distinction of matter and mind had not as yet arisen.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus materialism receives an illusive aid from language; and both in philosophy and religion the imaginary figure or association easily takes the place of real knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">109</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, there is the illusion of looking into our own minds as if our thoughts or feelings were written down in a book.</div><div class="sentence"> This is another figure of speech, which might be appropriately termed 'the fallacy of the looking-glass.'</div><div class="sentence"> We cannot look at the mind unless we have the eye which sees, and we can only look, not into, but out of the mind at the thoughts, words, actions of ourselves and others.</div><div class="sentence"> What we dimly recognize within us is not experience, but rather the suggestion of an experience, which we may gather, if we will, from the observation of the world.</div><div class="sentence"> The memory has but a feeble recollection of what we were saying or doing a few weeks or a few months ago, and still less of what we were thinking or feeling.</div><div class="sentence"> This is one among many reasons why there is so little self-knowledge among mankind; they do not carry with them the thought of what they are or have been.</div><div class="sentence"> The so-called 'facts of consciousness' are equally evanescent; they are facts which nobody ever saw, and which can neither be defined nor described.</div><div class="sentence"> Of the three laws of thought the first (All A = A) is an identical proposition—that is to say, a mere word or symbol claiming to be a proposition: the two others (Nothing can be A and not A, and Everything is either A or not A) are untrue, because they exclude degrees and also the mixed modes and double aspects under which truth is so often presented to us.</div><div class="sentence"> To assert that man is man is unmeaning; to say that he is free or necessary and cannot be both is a half truth only.</div><div class="sentence"> These are a few of the entanglements which impede the natural course of human thought.</div><div class="sentence"> Lastly, there is the fallacy which lies still deeper, of regarding the individual mind apart from the universal, or either, as a self-existent entity apart from the ideas which are contained in them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span> <div class="sentence">  In ancient philosophies the analysis of the mind is still rudimentary and imperfect.</div><div class="sentence"> It naturally began with an effort to disengage the universal from sense—this was the first lifting up of the mist.</div><div class="sentence"> It wavered between object and subject, passing imperceptibly from one or Being to mind and thought.</div><div class="sentence"> Appearance in the outward object was for a time indistinguishable from opinion in the subject.</div><div class="sentence"> At length mankind spoke of knowing as well as of opining or perceiving.</div><div class="sentence"> But when the word 'knowledge' was found how was it to be explained or defined?</div><div class="sentence"> It was not an error, it was a step in the right direction, when Protagoras said that 'Man is the measure of all things,' and that 'All knowledge is perception.'</div><div class="sentence"> This was the subjective which corresponded to the objective 'All is flux.'</div><div class="sentence"> But the thoughts of men deepened, and soon they began to be aware that knowledge was neither sense, nor yet opinion—with or without explanation; nor the expression of thought, nor the enumeration of parts, nor the addition of characteristic marks.</div><div class="sentence"> Motion and rest were equally ill adapted to express its nature, although both must in some sense be attributed to it; it might be described more truly as the mind conversing with herself; the discourse of reason; the hymn of dialectic, the science of relations, of ideas, of the so-called arts and sciences, of the one, of the good, of the all:—this is the way along which Plato is leading us in his later dialogues.</div><div class="sentence"> In its higher signification it was the knowledge, not of men, but of gods, perfect and all sufficing:—like other ideals always passing out of sight, and nevertheless present to the mind of Aristotle as well as Plato, and the reality to which they were both tending.</div><div class="sentence"> For Aristotle as well as Plato would in modern phraseology have been termed a mystic; and like him would have defined the higher philosophy to be 'Knowledge of being or essence,'—words to which in our own day we have a difficulty in attaching a meaning.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">111</span> <div class="sentence">  Yet, in spite of Plato and his followers, mankind have again and again returned to a sensational philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> As to some of the early thinkers, amid the fleetings of sensible objects, ideas alone seemed to be fixed, so to a later generation amid the fluctuation of philosophical opinions the only fixed points appeared to be outward objects.</div><div class="sentence"> Any pretence of knowledge which went beyond them implied logical processes, of the correctness of which they had no assurance and which at best were only probable.</div><div class="sentence"> The mind, tired of wandering, sought to rest on firm ground; when the idols of philosophy and language were stripped off, the perception of outward objects alone remained.</div><div class="sentence"> The ancient Epicureans never asked whether the comparison of these with one another did not involve principles of another kind which were above and beyond them.</div><div class="sentence"> In like manner the modern inductive philosophy forgot to enquire into the meaning of experience, and did not attempt to form a conception of outward objects apart from the mind, or of the mind apart from them.</div><div class="sentence"> Soon objects of sense were merged in sensations and feelings, but feelings and sensations were still unanalyzed.</div><div class="sentence"> At last we return to the doctrine attributed by Plato to Protagoras, that the mind is only a succession of momentary perceptions.</div><div class="sentence"> At this point the modern philosophy of experience forms an alliance with ancient scepticism.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">112</span> <div class="sentence">  The higher truths of philosophy and religion are very far removed from sense.</div><div class="sentence"> Admitting that, like all other knowledge, they are derived from experience, and that experience is ultimately resolvable into facts which come to us through the eye and ear, still their origin is a mere accident which has nothing to do with their true nature.</div><div class="sentence"> They are universal and unseen; they belong to all times—past, present, and future.</div><div class="sentence"> Any worthy notion of mind or reason includes them.</div><div class="sentence"> The proof of them is, 1st, their comprehensiveness and consistency with one another; 2ndly, their agreement with history and experience.</div><div class="sentence"> But sensation is of the present only, is isolated, is and is not in successive moments.</div><div class="sentence"> It takes the passing hour as it comes, following the lead of the eye or ear instead of the command of reason.</div><div class="sentence"> It is a faculty which man has in common with the animals, and in which he is inferior to many of them.</div><div class="sentence"> The importance of the senses in us is that they are the apertures of the mind, doors and windows through which we take in and make our own the materials of knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> Regarded in any other point of view sensation is of all mental acts the most trivial and superficial.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence the term 'sensational' is rightly used to express what is shallow in thought and feeling.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">116</span> <div class="sentence">  The simplest sensation involves an unconscious or nascent operation of the mind; it implies objects of sense, and objects of sense have differences of form, number, colour.</div><div class="sentence"> But the conception of an object without us, or the power of discriminating numbers, forms, colours, is not given by the sense, but by the mind.</div><div class="sentence"> A mere sensation does not attain to distinctness: it is a confused impression, sugkechumenon ti, as Plato says (Republic), until number introduces light and order into the confusion.</div><div class="sentence"> At what point confusion becomes distinctness is a question of degree which cannot be precisely determined.</div><div class="sentence"> The distant object, the undefined notion, come out into relief as we approach them or attend to them.</div><div class="sentence"> Or we may assist the analysis by attempting to imagine the world first dawning upon the eye of the infant or of a person newly restored to sight.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet even with them the mind as well as the eye opens or enlarges.</div><div class="sentence"> For all three are inseparably bound together—the object would be nowhere and nothing, if not perceived by the sense, and the sense would have no power of distinguishing without the mind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">117</span> <div class="sentence">  But prior to objects of sense there is a third nature in which they are contained—that is to say, space, which may be explained in various ways.</div><div class="sentence"> It is the element which surrounds them; it is the vacuum or void which they leave or occupy when passing from one portion of space to another.</div><div class="sentence"> It might be described in the language of ancient philosophy, as 'the Not-being' of objects.</div><div class="sentence"> It is a negative idea which in the course of ages has become positive.</div><div class="sentence"> It is originally derived from the contemplation of the world without us—the boundless earth or sea, the vacant heaven, and is therefore acquired chiefly through the sense of sight: to the blind the conception of space is feeble and inadequate, derived for the most part from touch or from the descriptions of others.</div><div class="sentence"> At first it appears to be continuous; afterwards we perceive it to be capable of division by lines or points, real or imaginary.</div><div class="sentence"> By the help of mathematics we form another idea of space, which is altogether independent of experience.</div><div class="sentence"> Geometry teaches us that the innumerable lines and figures by which space is or may be intersected are absolutely true in all their combinations and consequences.</div><div class="sentence"> New and unchangeable properties of space are thus developed, which are proved to us in a thousand ways by mathematical reasoning as well as by common experience.</div><div class="sentence"> Through quantity and measure we are conducted to our simplest and purest notion of matter, which is to the cube or solid what space is to the square or surface.</div><div class="sentence"> And all our applications of mathematics are applications of our ideas of space to matter.</div><div class="sentence"> No wonder then that they seem to have a necessary existence to us.</div><div class="sentence"> Being the simplest of our ideas, space is also the one of which we have the most difficulty in ridding ourselves.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither can we set a limit to it, for wherever we fix a limit, space is springing up beyond.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither can we conceive a smallest or indivisible portion of it; for within the smallest there is a smaller still; and even these inconceivable qualities of space, whether the infinite or the infinitesimal, may be made the subject of reasoning and have a certain truth to us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">118</span> <div class="sentence">  Whether space exists in the mind or out of it, is a question which has no meaning.</div><div class="sentence"> We should rather say that without it the mind is incapable of conceiving the body, and therefore of conceiving itself.</div><div class="sentence"> The mind may be indeed imagined to contain the body, in the same way that Aristotle (partly following Plato) supposes God to be the outer heaven or circle of the universe.</div><div class="sentence"> But how can the individual mind carry about the universe of space packed up within, or how can separate minds have either a universe of their own or a common universe?</div><div class="sentence"> In such conceptions there seems to be a confusion of the individual and the universal.</div><div class="sentence"> To say that we can only have a true idea of ourselves when we deny the reality of that by which we have any idea of ourselves is an absurdity.</div><div class="sentence"> The earth which is our habitation and 'the starry heaven above' and we ourselves are equally an illusion, if space is only a quality or condition of our minds.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">119</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, we may compare the truths of space with other truths derived from experience, which seem to have a necessity to us in proportion to the frequency of their recurrence or the truth of the consequences which may be inferred from them.</div><div class="sentence"> We are thus led to remark that the necessity in our ideas of space on which much stress has been laid, differs in a slight degree only from the necessity which appears to belong to other of our ideas, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> weight, motion, and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> And there is another way in which this necessity may be explained.</div><div class="sentence"> We have been taught it, and the truth which we were taught or which we inherited has never been contradicted in all our experience and is therefore confirmed by it.</div><div class="sentence"> Who can resist an idea which is presented to him in a general form in every moment of his life and of which he finds no instance to the contrary?</div><div class="sentence"> The greater part of what is sometimes regarded as the a priori intuition of space is really the conception of the various geometrical figures of which the properties have been revealed by mathematical analysis.</div><div class="sentence"> And the certainty of these properties is immeasurably increased to us by our finding that they hold good not only in every instance, but in all the consequences which are supposed to flow from them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">120</span> <div class="sentence">  Neither must we forget that our idea of space, like our other ideas, has a history.</div><div class="sentence"> The Homeric poems contain no word for it; even the later Greek philosophy has not the Kantian notion of space, but only the definite 'place' or 'the infinite.'</div><div class="sentence"> To Plato, in the Timaeus, it is known only as the 'nurse of generation.'</div><div class="sentence"> When therefore we speak of the necessity of our ideas of space we must remember that this is a necessity which has grown up with the growth of the human mind, and has been made by ourselves.</div><div class="sentence"> We can free ourselves from the perplexities which are involved in it by ascending to a time in which they did not as yet exist.</div><div class="sentence"> And when space or time are described as 'a priori forms or intuitions added to the matter given in sensation,' we should consider that such expressions belong really to the 'pre-historic study' of philosophy, i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> to the eighteenth century, when men sought to explain the human mind without regard to history or language or the social nature of man.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">121</span> <div class="sentence">  In every act of sense there is a latent perception of space, of which we only become conscious when objects are withdrawn from it.</div><div class="sentence"> There are various ways in which we may trace the connexion between them.</div><div class="sentence"> We may think of space as unresisting matter, and of matter as divided into objects; or of objects again as formed by abstraction into a collective notion of matter, and of matter as rarefied into space.</div><div class="sentence"> And motion may be conceived as the union of there and not there in space, and force as the materializing or solidification of motion.</div><div class="sentence"> Space again is the individual and universal in one; or, in other words, a perception and also a conception.</div><div class="sentence"> So easily do what are sometimes called our simple ideas pass into one another, and differences of kind resolve themselves into differences of degree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">122</span> <div class="sentence">  Within or behind space there is another abstraction in many respects similar to it—time, the form of the inward, as space is the form of the outward.</div><div class="sentence"> As we cannot think of outward objects of sense or of outward sensations without space, so neither can we think of a succession of sensations without time.</div><div class="sentence"> It is the vacancy of thoughts or sensations, as space is the void of outward objects, and we can no more imagine the mind without the one than the world without the other.</div><div class="sentence"> It is to arithmetic what space is to geometry; or, more strictly, arithmetic may be said to be equally applicable to both.</div><div class="sentence"> It is defined in our minds, partly by the analogy of space and partly by the recollection of events which have happened to us, or the consciousness of feelings which we are experiencing.</div><div class="sentence"> Like space, it is without limit, for whatever beginning or end of time we fix, there is a beginning and end before them, and so on without end.</div><div class="sentence"> We speak of a past, present, and future, and again the analogy of space assists us in conceiving of them as coexistent.</div><div class="sentence"> When the limit of time is removed there arises in our minds the idea of eternity, which at first, like time itself, is only negative, but gradually, when connected with the world and the divine nature, like the other negative infinity of space, becomes positive.</div><div class="sentence"> Whether time is prior to the mind and to experience, or coeval with them, is (like the parallel question about space) unmeaning.</div><div class="sentence"> Like space it has been realized gradually: in the Homeric poems, or even in the Hesiodic cosmogony, there is no more notion of time than of space.</div><div class="sentence"> The conception of being is more general than either, and might therefore with greater plausibility be affirmed to be a condition or quality of the mind.</div><div class="sentence"> The a priori intuitions of Kant would have been as unintelligible to Plato as his a priori synthetical propositions to Aristotle.</div><div class="sentence"> The philosopher of Konigsberg supposed himself to be analyzing a necessary mode of thought: he was not aware that he was dealing with a mere abstraction.</div><div class="sentence"> But now that we are able to trace the gradual developement of ideas through religion, through language, through abstractions, why should we interpose the fiction of time between ourselves and realities?</div><div class="sentence"> Why should we single out one of these abstractions to be the a priori condition of all the others?</div><div class="sentence"> It comes last and not first in the order of our thoughts, and is not the condition precedent of them, but the last generalization of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor can any principle be imagined more suicidal to philosophy than to assume that all the truth which we are capable of attaining is seen only through an unreal medium.</div><div class="sentence"> If all that exists in time is illusion, we may well ask with Plato, 'What becomes of the mind?'</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">136</span> <div class="sentence">  We are often told that we should enquire into all things before we accept them;—with what limitations is this true?</div><div class="sentence"> For we cannot use our senses without admitting that we have them, or think without presupposing that there is in us a power of thought, or affirm that all knowledge is derived from experience without implying that this first principle of knowledge is prior to experience.</div><div class="sentence"> The truth seems to be that we begin with the natural use of the mind as of the body, and we seek to describe this as well as we can.</div><div class="sentence"> We eat before we know the nature of digestion; we think before we know the nature of reflection.</div><div class="sentence"> As our knowledge increases, our perception of the mind enlarges also.</div><div class="sentence"> We cannot indeed get beyond facts, but neither can we draw any line which separates facts from ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> And the mind is not something separate from them but included in them, and they in the mind, both having a distinctness and individuality of their own.</div><div class="sentence"> To reduce our conception of mind to a succession of feelings and sensations is like the attempt to view a wide prospect by inches through a microscope, or to calculate a period of chronology by minutes.</div><div class="sentence"> The mind ceases to exist when it loses its continuity, which though far from being its highest determination, is yet necessary to any conception of it.</div><div class="sentence"> Even an inanimate nature cannot be adequately represented as an endless succession of states or conditions.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">141</span> <div class="sentence">  The philosophies of Epicurus or Hume give no adequate or dignified conception of the mind.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no organic unity in a succession of feeling or sensations; no comprehensiveness in an infinity of separate actions.</div><div class="sentence"> The individual never reflects upon himself as a whole; he can hardly regard one act or part of his life as the cause or effect of any other act or part.</div><div class="sentence"> Whether in practice or speculation, he is to himself only in successive instants.</div><div class="sentence"> To such thinkers, whether in ancient or in modern times, the mind is only the poor recipient of impressions—not the heir of all the ages, or connected with all other minds.</div><div class="sentence"> It begins again with its own modicum of experience having only such vague conceptions of the wisdom of the past as are inseparable from language and popular opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> It seeks to explain from the experience of the individual what can only be learned from the history of the world.</div><div class="sentence"> It has no conception of obligation, duty, conscience—these are to the Epicurean or Utilitarian philosopher only names which interfere with our natural perceptions of pleasure and pain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">142</span> <div class="sentence">  There seem then to be several answers to the question, Why the theory that all knowledge is sensation is allied to the lower rather than to the higher view of ethical philosophy:—1st, Because it is easier to understand and practise; 2ndly, Because it is fatal to the pursuit of ideals, moral, political, or religious; 3rdly, Because it deprives us of the means and instruments of higher thought, of any adequate conception of the mind, of knowledge, of conscience, of moral obligation.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">150</span> <div class="sentence">  We may preface the enquiry by two or three remarks:—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">151</span> <div class="sentence">  (1) We do not claim for the popular Psychology the position of a science at all; it cannot, like the Physical Sciences, proceed by the Inductive Method: it has not the necessity of Mathematics: it does not, like Metaphysic, argue from abstract notions or from internal coherence.</div><div class="sentence"> It is made up of scattered observations.</div><div class="sentence"> A few of these, though they may sometimes appear to be truisms, are of the greatest value, and free from all doubt.</div><div class="sentence"> We are conscious of them in ourselves; we observe them working in others; we are assured of them at all times.</div><div class="sentence"> For example, we are absolutely certain, (a) of the influence exerted by the mind over the body or by the body over the mind: (b) of the power of association, by which the appearance of some person or the occurrence of some event recalls to mind, not always but often, other persons and events: (c) of the effect of habit, which is strongest when least disturbed by reflection, and is to the mind what the bones are to the body: (d) of the real, though not unlimited, freedom of the human will: (e) of the reference, more or less distinct, of our sensations, feelings, thoughts, actions, to ourselves, which is called consciousness, or, when in excess, self-consciousness: (f) of the distinction of the 'I' and 'Not I,' of ourselves and outward objects.</div><div class="sentence"> But when we attempt to gather up these elements in a single system, we discover that the links by which we combine them are apt to be mere words.</div><div class="sentence"> We are in a country which has never been cleared or surveyed; here and there only does a gleam of light come through the darkness of the forest.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">152</span> <div class="sentence">  (2) These fragments, although they can never become science in the ordinary sense of the word, are a real part of knowledge and may be of great value in education.</div><div class="sentence"> We may be able to add a good deal to them from our own experience, and we may verify them by it.</div><div class="sentence"> Self-examination is one of those studies which a man can pursue alone, by attention to himself and the processes of his individual mind.</div><div class="sentence"> He may learn much about his own character and about the character of others, if he will 'make his mind sit down' and look at itself in the glass.</div><div class="sentence"> The great, if not the only use of such a study is a practical one,—to know, first, human nature, and, secondly, our own nature, as it truly is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">153</span> <div class="sentence">  (3) Hence it is important that we should conceive of the mind in the noblest and simplest manner.</div><div class="sentence"> While acknowledging that language has been the greatest factor in the formation of human thought, we must endeavour to get rid of the disguises, oppositions, contradictions, which arise out of it.</div><div class="sentence"> We must disengage ourselves from the ideas which the customary use of words has implanted in us.</div><div class="sentence"> To avoid error as much as possible when we are speaking of things unseen, the principal terms which we use should be few, and we should not allow ourselves to be enslaved by them.</div><div class="sentence"> Instead of seeking to frame a technical language, we should vary our forms of speech, lest they should degenerate into formulas.</div><div class="sentence"> A difficult philosophical problem is better understood when translated into the vernacular.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">154</span> <div class="sentence">  I.a.</div><div class="sentence"> Psychology is inseparable from language, and early language contains the first impressions or the oldest experience of man respecting himself.</div><div class="sentence"> These impressions are not accurate representations of the truth; they are the reflections of a rudimentary age of philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> The first and simplest forms of thought are rooted so deep in human nature that they can never be got rid of; but they have been perpetually enlarged and elevated, and the use of many words has been transferred from the body to the mind.</div><div class="sentence"> The spiritual and intellectual have thus become separated from the material—there is a cleft between them; and the heart and the conscience of man rise above the dominion of the appetites and create a new language in which they too find expression.</div><div class="sentence"> As the differences of actions begin to be perceived, more and more names are needed.</div><div class="sentence"> This is the first analysis of the human mind; having a general foundation in popular experience, it is moulded to a certain extent by hierophants and philosophers.</div><div class="sentence"> (See Introd.</div><div class="sentence"> to Cratylus.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">155</span> <div class="sentence">  b.</div><div class="sentence"> This primitive psychology is continually receiving additions from the first thinkers, who in return take a colour from the popular language of the time.</div><div class="sentence"> The mind is regarded from new points of view, and becomes adapted to new conditions of knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> It seeks to isolate itself from matter and sense, and to assert its independence in thought.</div><div class="sentence"> It recognizes that it is independent of the external world.</div><div class="sentence"> It has five or six natural states or stages:—(1) sensation, in which it is almost latent or quiescent: (2) feeling, or inner sense, when the mind is just awakening: (3) memory, which is decaying sense, and from time to time, as with a spark or flash, has the power of recollecting or reanimating the buried past: (4) thought, in which images pass into abstract notions or are intermingled with them: (5) action, in which the mind moves forward, of itself, or under the impulse of want or desire or pain, to attain or avoid some end or consequence: and (6) there is the composition of these or the admixture or assimilation of them in various degrees.</div><div class="sentence"> We never see these processes of the mind, nor can we tell the causes of them.</div><div class="sentence"> But we know them by their results, and learn from other men that so far as we can describe to them or they to us the workings of the mind, their experience is the same or nearly the same with our own.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">156</span> <div class="sentence">  c. But the knowledge of the mind is not to any great extent derived from the observation of the individual by himself.</div><div class="sentence"> It is the growing consciousness of the human race, embodied in language, acknowledged by experience, and corrected from time to time by the influence of literature and philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> A great, perhaps the most important, part of it is to be found in early Greek thought.</div><div class="sentence"> In the Theaetetus of Plato it has not yet become fixed: we are still stumbling on the threshold.</div><div class="sentence"> In Aristotle the process is more nearly completed, and has gained innumerable abstractions, of which many have had to be thrown away because relative only to the controversies of the time.</div><div class="sentence"> In the interval between Thales and Aristotle were realized the distinctions of mind and body, of universal and particular, of infinite and infinitesimal, of idea and phenomenon; the class conceptions of faculties and virtues, the antagonism of the appetites and the reason; and connected with this, at a higher stage of development, the opposition of moral and intellectual virtue; also the primitive conceptions of unity, being, rest, motion, and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> These divisions were not really scientific, but rather based on popular experience.</div><div class="sentence"> They were not held with the precision of modern thinkers, but taken all together they gave a new existence to the mind in thought, and greatly enlarged and more accurately defined man's knowledge of himself and of the world.</div><div class="sentence"> The majority of them have been accepted by Christian and Western nations.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet in modern times we have also drifted so far away from Aristotle, that if we were to frame a system on his lines we should be at war with ordinary language and untrue to our own consciousness.</div><div class="sentence"> And there have been a few both in mediaeval times and since the Reformation who have rebelled against the Aristotelian point of view.</div><div class="sentence"> Of these eccentric thinkers there have been various types, but they have all a family likeness.</div><div class="sentence"> According to them, there has been too much analysis and too little synthesis, too much division of the mind into parts and too little conception of it as a whole or in its relation to God and the laws of the universe.</div><div class="sentence"> They have thought that the elements of plurality and unity have not been duly adjusted.</div><div class="sentence"> The tendency of such writers has been to allow the personality of man to be absorbed in the universal, or in the divine nature, and to deny the distinction between matter and mind, or to substitute one for the other.</div><div class="sentence"> They have broken some of the idols of Psychology: they have challenged the received meaning of words: they have regarded the mind under many points of view.</div><div class="sentence"> But though they may have shaken the old, they have not established the new; their views of philosophy, which seem like the echo of some voice from the East, have been alien to the mind of Europe.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">157</span> <div class="sentence">  d. The Psychology which is found in common language is in some degree verified by experience, but not in such a manner as to give it the character of an exact science.</div><div class="sentence"> We cannot say that words always correspond to facts.</div><div class="sentence"> Common language represents the mind from different and even opposite points of view, which cannot be all of them equally true (compare Cratylus).</div><div class="sentence"> Yet from diversity of statements and opinions may be obtained a nearer approach to the truth than is to be gained from any one of them.</div><div class="sentence"> It also tends to correct itself, because it is gradually brought nearer to the common sense of mankind.</div><div class="sentence"> There are some leading categories or classifications of thought, which, though unverified, must always remain the elements from which the science or study of the mind proceeds.</div><div class="sentence"> For example, we must assume ideas before we can analyze them, and also a continuing mind to which they belong; the resolution of it into successive moments, which would say, with Protagoras, that the man is not the same person which he was a minute ago, is, as Plato implies in the Theaetetus, an absurdity.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">158</span> <div class="sentence">  e. The growth of the mind, which may be traced in the histories of religions and philosophies and in the thoughts of nations, is one of the deepest and noblest modes of studying it.</div><div class="sentence"> Here we are dealing with the reality, with the greater and, as it may be termed, the most sacred part of history.</div><div class="sentence"> We study the mind of man as it begins to be inspired by a human or divine reason, as it is modified by circumstances, as it is distributed in nations, as it is renovated by great movements, which go beyond the limits of nations and affect human society on a scale still greater, as it is created or renewed by great minds, who, looking down from above, have a wider and more comprehensive vision.</div><div class="sentence"> This is an ambitious study, of which most of us rather 'entertain conjecture' than arrive at any detailed or accurate knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> Later arises the reflection how these great ideas or movements of the world have been appropriated by the multitude and found a way to the minds of individuals.</div><div class="sentence"> The real Psychology is that which shows how the increasing knowledge of nature and the increasing experience of life have always been slowly transforming the mind, how religions too have been modified in the course of ages 'that God may be all and in all.'</div><div class="sentence"> E pollaplasion, eoe, to ergon e os nun zeteitai prostatteis.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">159</span> <div class="sentence">  f. Lastly, though we speak of the study of mind in a special sense, it may also be said that there is no science which does not contribute to our knowledge of it.</div><div class="sentence"> The methods of science and their analogies are new faculties, discovered by the few and imparted to the many.</div><div class="sentence"> They are to the mind, what the senses are to the body; or better, they may be compared to instruments such as the telescope or microscope by which the discriminating power of the senses, or to other mechanical inventions, by which the strength and skill of the human body is so immeasurably increased.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">160</span> <div class="sentence">  II.</div><div class="sentence"> The new Psychology, whatever may be its claim to the authority of a science, has called attention to many facts and corrected many errors, which without it would have been unexamined.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet it is also itself very liable to illusion.</div><div class="sentence"> The evidence on which it rests is vague and indefinite.</div><div class="sentence"> The field of consciousness is never seen by us as a whole, but only at particular points, which are always changing.</div><div class="sentence"> The veil of language intercepts facts.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence it is desirable that in making an approach to the study we should consider at the outset what are the kinds of error which most easily affect it, and note the differences which separate it from other branches of knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">161</span> <div class="sentence">  a.</div><div class="sentence"> First, we observe the mind by the mind.</div><div class="sentence"> It would seem therefore that we are always in danger of leaving out the half of that which is the subject of our enquiry.</div><div class="sentence"> We come at once upon the difficulty of what is the meaning of the word.</div><div class="sentence"> Does it differ as subject and object in the same manner?</div><div class="sentence"> Can we suppose one set of feelings or one part of the mind to interpret another?</div><div class="sentence"> Is the introspecting thought the same with the thought which is introspected?</div><div class="sentence"> Has the mind the power of surveying its whole domain at one and the same time?—No more than the eye can take in the whole human body at a glance.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet there may be a glimpse round the corner, or a thought transferred in a moment from one point of view to another, which enables us to see nearly the whole, if not at once, at any rate in succession.</div><div class="sentence"> Such glimpses will hardly enable us to contemplate from within the mind in its true proportions.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence the firmer ground of Psychology is not the consciousness of inward feelings but the observation of external actions, being the actions not only of ourselves, but of the innumerable persons whom we come across in life.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">162</span> <div class="sentence">  b.</div><div class="sentence"> The error of supposing partial or occasional explanation of mental phenomena to be the only or complete ones.</div><div class="sentence"> For example, we are disinclined to admit of the spontaneity or discontinuity of the mind—it seems to us like an effect without a cause, and therefore we suppose the train of our thoughts to be always called up by association.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet it is probable, or indeed certain, that of many mental phenomena there are no mental antecedents, but only bodily ones.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">163</span> <div class="sentence">  c.

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">174</span> <div class="sentence">  The principal subjects of Psychology may be summed up as follows:—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">175</span> <div class="sentence">  a.</div><div class="sentence"> The relation of man to the world around him,—in what sense and within what limits can he withdraw from its laws or assert himself against them (Freedom and Necessity), and what is that which we suppose to be thus independent and which we call ourselves?</div><div class="sentence"> How does the inward differ from the outward and what is the relation between them, and where do we draw the line by which we separate mind from matter, the soul from the body?</div><div class="sentence"> Is the mind active or passive, or partly both?</div><div class="sentence"> Are its movements identical with those of the body, or only preconcerted and coincident with them, or is one simply an aspect of the other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">176</span> <div class="sentence">  b.</div><div class="sentence"> What are we to think of time and space?</div><div class="sentence"> Time seems to have a nearer connexion with the mind, space with the body; yet time, as well as space, is necessary to our idea of either.</div><div class="sentence"> We see also that they have an analogy with one another, and that in Mathematics they often interpenetrate.</div><div class="sentence"> Space or place has been said by Kant to be the form of the outward, time of the inward sense.</div><div class="sentence"> He regards them as parts or forms of the mind.</div><div class="sentence"> But this is an unfortunate and inexpressive way of describing their relation to us.</div><div class="sentence"> For of all the phenomena present to the human mind they seem to have most the character of objective existence.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no use in asking what is beyond or behind them; we cannot get rid of them.</div><div class="sentence"> And to throw the laws of external nature which to us are the type of the immutable into the subjective side of the antithesis seems to be equally inappropriate.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">177</span> <div class="sentence">  c. When in imagination we enter into the closet of the mind and withdraw ourselves from the external world, we seem to find there more or less distinct processes which may be described by the words, 'I perceive,' 'I feel,' 'I think,' 'I want,' 'I wish,' 'I like,' 'I dislike,' 'I fear,' 'I know,' 'I remember,' 'I imagine,' 'I dream,' 'I act,' 'I endeavour,' 'I hope.'</div><div class="sentence"> These processes would seem to have the same notions attached to them in the minds of all educated persons.</div><div class="sentence"> They are distinguished from one another in thought, but they intermingle.</div><div class="sentence"> It is possible to reflect upon them or to become conscious of them in a greater or less degree, or with a greater or less continuity or attention, and thus arise the intermittent phenomena of consciousness or self-consciousness.</div><div class="sentence"> The use of all of them is possible to us at all times; and therefore in any operation of the mind the whole are latent.</div><div class="sentence"> But we are able to characterise them sufficiently by that part of the complex action which is the most prominent.</div><div class="sentence"> We have no difficulty in distinguishing an act of sight or an act of will from an act of thought, although thought is present in both of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence the conception of different faculties or different virtues is precarious, because each of them is passing into the other, and they are all one in the mind itself; they appear and reappear, and may all be regarded as the ever-varying phases or aspects or differences of the same mind or person.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">178</span> <div class="sentence">  d. Nearest the sense in the scale of the intellectual faculties is memory, which is a mode rather than a faculty of the mind, and accompanies all mental operations.</div><div class="sentence"> There are two principal kinds of it, recollection and recognition,—recollection in which forgotten things are recalled or return to the mind, recognition in which the mind finds itself again among things once familiar.</div><div class="sentence"> The simplest way in which we can represent the former to ourselves is by shutting our eyes and trying to recall in what we term the mind's eye the picture of the surrounding scene, or by laying down the book which we are reading and recapitulating what we can remember of it.</div><div class="sentence"> But many times more powerful than recollection is recognition, perhaps because it is more assisted by association.</div><div class="sentence"> We have known and forgotten, and after a long interval the thing which we have seen once is seen again by us, but with a different feeling, and comes back to us, not as new knowledge, but as a thing to which we ourselves impart a notion already present to us; in Plato's words, we set the stamp upon the wax.</div><div class="sentence"> Every one is aware of the difference between the first and second sight of a place, between a scene clothed with associations or bare and divested of them.</div><div class="sentence"> We say to ourselves on revisiting a spot after a long interval: How many things have happened since I last saw this!</div><div class="sentence"> There is probably no impression ever received by us of which we can venture to say that the vestiges are altogether lost, or that we might not, under some circumstances, recover it.</div><div class="sentence"> A long-forgotten knowledge may be easily renewed and therefore is very different from ignorance.</div><div class="sentence"> Of the language learnt in childhood not a word may be remembered, and yet, when a new beginning is made, the old habit soon returns, the neglected organs come back into use, and the river of speech finds out the dried-up channel.</div></div>

'Consciousness' is the most treacherous word which is employed in the study of the mind, for it is used in many senses, and has rarely, if ever, been minutely analyzed.</div><div class="sentence"> Like memory, it accompanies all mental operations, but not always continuously, and it exists in various degrees.</div><div class="sentence"> It may be imperceptible or hardly perceptible: it may be the living sense that our thoughts, actions, sufferings, are our own.</div><div class="sentence"> It is a kind of attention which we pay to ourselves, and is intermittent rather than continuous.</div><div class="sentence"> Its sphere has been exaggerated.</div><div class="sentence"> It is sometimes said to assure us of our freedom; but this is an illusion: as there may be a real freedom without consciousness of it, so there may be a consciousness of freedom without the reality.</div><div class="sentence"> It may be regarded as a higher degree of knowledge when we not only know but know that we know.</div><div class="sentence"> Consciousness is opposed to habit, inattention, sleep, death.</div><div class="sentence"> It may be illustrated by its derivative conscience, which speaks to men, not only of right and wrong in the abstract, but of right and wrong actions in reference to themselves and their circumstances.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">180</span> <div class="sentence">  f. Association is another of the ever-present phenomena of the human mind.</div><div class="sentence"> We speak of the laws of association, but this is an expression which is confusing, for the phenomenon itself is of the most capricious and uncertain sort.</div><div class="sentence"> It may be briefly described as follows.</div><div class="sentence"> The simplest case of association is that of sense.</div><div class="sentence"> When we see or hear separately one of two things, which we have previously seen or heard together, the occurrence of the one has a tendency to suggest the other.</div><div class="sentence"> So the sight or name of a house may recall to our minds the memory of those who once lived there.</div><div class="sentence"> Like may recall like and everything its opposite.</div><div class="sentence"> The parts of a whole, the terms of a series, objects lying near, words having a customary order stick together in the mind.</div><div class="sentence"> A word may bring back a passage of poetry or a whole system of philosophy; from one end of the world or from one pole of knowledge we may travel to the other in an indivisible instant.</div><div class="sentence"> The long train of association by which we pass from one point to the other, involving every sort of complex relation, so sudden, so accidental, is one of the greatest wonders of mind...This process however is not always continuous, but often intermittent: we can think of things in isolation as well as in association; we do not mean that they must all hang from one another.</div><div class="sentence"> We can begin again after an interval of rest or vacancy, as a new train of thought suddenly arises, as, for example, when we wake of a morning or after violent exercise.</div><div class="sentence"> Time, place, the same colour or sound or smell or taste, will often call up some thought or recollection either accidentally or naturally associated with them.</div><div class="sentence"> But it is equally noticeable that the new thought may occur to us, we cannot tell how or why, by the spontaneous action of the mind itself or by the latent influence of the body.</div><div class="sentence"> Both science and poetry are made up of associations or recollections, but we must observe also that the mind is not wholly dependent on them, having also the power of origination.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">181</span> <div class="sentence">  There are other processes of the mind which it is good for us to study when we are at home and by ourselves,—the manner in which thought passes into act, the conflict of passion and reason in many stages, the transition from sensuality to love or sentiment and from earthly love to heavenly, the slow and silent influence of habit, which little by little changes the nature of men, the sudden change of the old nature of man into a new one, wrought by shame or by some other overwhelming impulse.</div><div class="sentence"> These are the greater phenomena of mind, and he who has thought of them for himself will live and move in a better-ordered world, and will himself be a better-ordered man.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">182</span> <div class="sentence">  At the other end of the 'globus intellectualis,' nearest, not to earth and sense, but to heaven and God, is the personality of man, by which he holds communion with the unseen world.</div><div class="sentence"> Somehow, he knows not how, somewhere, he knows not where, under this higher aspect of his being he grasps the ideas of God, freedom and immortality; he sees the forms of truth, holiness and love, and is satisfied with them.</div><div class="sentence"> No account of the mind can be complete which does not admit the reality or the possibility of another life.</div><div class="sentence"> Whether regarded as an ideal or as a fact, the highest part of man's nature and that in which it seems most nearly to approach the divine, is a phenomenon which exists, and must therefore be included within the domain of Psychology.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">183</span> <div class="sentence">  IV.</div><div class="sentence"> We admit that there is no perfect or ideal Psychology.</div><div class="sentence"> It is not a whole in the same sense in which Chemistry, Physiology, or Mathematics are wholes: that is to say, it is not a connected unity of knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> Compared with the wealth of other sciences, it rests upon a small number of facts; and when we go beyond these, we fall into conjectures and verbal discussions.</div><div class="sentence"> The facts themselves are disjointed; the causes of them run up into other sciences, and we have no means of tracing them from one to the other.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet it may be true of this, as of other beginnings of knowledge, that the attempt to put them together has tested the truth of them, and given a stimulus to the enquiry into them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">184</span> <div class="sentence">  Psychology should be natural, not technical.</div><div class="sentence"> It should take the form which is the most intelligible to the common understanding, because it has to do with common things, which are familiar to us all.</div><div class="sentence"> It should aim at no more than every reflecting man knows or can easily verify for himself.</div><div class="sentence"> When simple and unpretentious, it is least obscured by words, least liable to fall under the influence of Physiology or Metaphysic.</div><div class="sentence"> It should argue, not from exceptional, but from ordinary phenomena.</div><div class="sentence"> It should be careful to distinguish the higher and the lower elements of human nature, and not allow one to be veiled in the disguise of the other, lest through the slippery nature of language we should pass imperceptibly from good to evil, from nature in the higher to nature in the neutral or lower sense.</div><div class="sentence"> It should assert consistently the unity of the human faculties, the unity of knowledge, the unity of God and law.</div><div class="sentence"> The difference between the will and the affections and between the reason and the passions should also be recognized by it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">185</span> <div class="sentence">  Its sphere is supposed to be narrowed to the individual soul; but it cannot be thus separated in fact.</div><div class="sentence"> It goes back to the beginnings of things, to the first growth of language and philosophy, and to the whole science of man.</div><div class="sentence"> There can be no truth or completeness in any study of the mind which is confined to the individual.</div><div class="sentence"> The nature of language, though not the whole, is perhaps at present the most important element in our knowledge of it.</div><div class="sentence"> It is not impossible that some numerical laws may be found to have a place in the relations of mind and matter, as in the rest of nature.</div><div class="sentence"> The old Pythagorean fancy that the soul 'is or has in it harmony' may in some degree be realized.</div><div class="sentence"> But the indications of such numerical harmonies are faint; either the secret of them lies deeper than we can discover, or nature may have rebelled against the use of them in the composition of men and animals.</div><div class="sentence"> It is with qualitative rather than with quantitative differences that we are concerned in Psychology.</div><div class="sentence"> The facts relating to the mind which we obtain from Physiology are negative rather than positive.</div><div class="sentence"> They show us, not the processes of mental action, but the conditions of which when deprived the mind ceases to act.</div><div class="sentence"> It would seem as if the time had not yet arrived when we can hope to add anything of much importance to our knowledge of the mind from the investigations of the microscope.</div><div class="sentence"> The elements of Psychology can still only be learnt from reflections on ourselves, which interpret and are also interpreted by our experience of others.</div><div class="sentence"> The history of language, of philosophy, and religion, the great thoughts or inventions or discoveries which move mankind, furnish the larger moulds or outlines in which the human mind has been cast.</div><div class="sentence"> From these the individual derives so much as he is able to comprehend or has the opportunity of learning.</div></div>

<div class="book_description">PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:</div> Socrates, Theodorus, Theaetetus. 
</div><div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  Euclid and Terpsion meet in front of Euclid's house in Megara; they enter the house, and the dialogue is read to them by a servant.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span><div class="speaker">EUCLID</div><div class="sentence">  Have you only just arrived from the country, Terpsion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span><div class="speaker">TERPSION</div><div class="sentence">  No, I came some time ago:  and I have been in the Agora looking for you, and wondering that I could not find you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span><div class="speaker">EUCLID</div><div class="sentence">  But I was not in the city.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span><div class="speaker">TERPSION</div><div class="sentence">  Where then?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span><div class="speaker">EUCLID</div><div class="sentence">  As I was going down to the harbour, I met Theaetetus—he was being carried up to Athens from the army at Corinth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span><div class="speaker">TERPSION</div><div class="sentence">  Was he alive or dead?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span><div class="speaker">EUCLID</div><div class="sentence">  He was scarcely alive, for he has been badly wounded; but he was suffering even more from the sickness which has broken out in the army.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span><div class="speaker">TERPSION</div><div class="sentence">  The dysentery, you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span><div class="speaker">EUCLID</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span><div class="speaker">TERPSION</div><div class="sentence">  Alas!</div><div class="sentence"> what a loss he will be!</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span><div class="speaker">EUCLID</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Terpsion, he is a noble fellow; only to-day I heard some people highly praising his behaviour in this very battle.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span><div class="speaker">TERPSION</div><div class="sentence">  No wonder; I should rather be surprised at hearing anything else of him.</div><div class="sentence"> But why did he go on, instead of stopping at Megara?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span><div class="speaker">EUCLID</div><div class="sentence">  He wanted to get home:  although I entreated and advised him to remain, he would not listen to me; so I set him on his way, and turned back, and then I remembered what Socrates had said of him, and thought how remarkably this, like all his predictions, had been fulfilled.</div><div class="sentence"> I believe that he had seen him a little before his own death, when Theaetetus was a youth, and he had a memorable conversation with him, which he repeated to me when I came to Athens; he was full of admiration of his genius, and said that he would most certainly be a great man, if he lived.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span><div class="speaker">TERPSION</div><div class="sentence">  The prophecy has certainly been fulfilled; but what was the conversation?</div><div class="sentence"> can you tell me?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span><div class="speaker">EUCLID</div><div class="sentence">  No, indeed, not offhand; but I took notes of it as soon as I got home; these I filled up from memory, writing them out at leisure; and whenever I went to Athens, I asked Socrates about any point which I had forgotten, and on my return I made corrections; thus I have nearly the whole conversation written down.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span><div class="speaker">TERPSION</div><div class="sentence">  I remember—you told me; and I have always been intending to ask you to show me the writing, but have put off doing so; and now, why should we not read it through?—having just come from the country, I should greatly like to rest.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span><div class="speaker">EUCLID</div><div class="sentence">  I too shall be very glad of a rest, for I went with Theaetetus as far as Erineum.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us go in, then, and, while we are reposing, the servant shall read to us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span><div class="speaker">TERPSION</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span><div class="speaker">EUCLID</div><div class="sentence">  Here is the roll, Terpsion; I may observe that I have introduced Socrates, not as narrating to me, but as actually conversing with the persons whom he mentioned—these were, Theodorus the geometrician (of Cyrene), and Theaetetus.</div><div class="sentence"> I have omitted, for the sake of convenience, the interlocutory words 'I said,' 'I remarked,' which he used when he spoke of himself, and again, 'he agreed,' or 'disagreed,' in the answer, lest the repetition of them should be troublesome.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span><div class="speaker">TERPSION</div><div class="sentence">  Quite right, Euclid.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span><div class="speaker">EUCLID</div><div class="sentence">  And now, boy, you may take the roll and read.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span> <div class="sentence">  EUCLID'S SERVANT READS.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  If I cared enough about the Cyrenians, Theodorus, I would ask you whether there are any rising geometricians or philosophers in that part of the world.</div><div class="sentence"> But I am more interested in our own Athenian youth, and I would rather know who among them are likely to do well.</div><div class="sentence"> I observe them as far as I can myself, and I enquire of any one whom they follow, and I see that a great many of them follow you, in which they are quite right, considering your eminence in geometry and in other ways.</div><div class="sentence"> Tell me then, if you have met with any one who is good for anything.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates, I have become acquainted with one very remarkable Athenian youth, whom I commend to you as well worthy of your attention.</div><div class="sentence"> If he had been a beauty I should have been afraid to praise him, lest you should suppose that I was in love with him; but he is no beauty, and you must not be offended if I say that he is very like you; for he has a snub nose and projecting eyes, although these features are less marked in him than in you.</div><div class="sentence"> Seeing, then, that he has no personal attractions, I may freely say, that in all my acquaintance, which is very large, I never knew any one who was his equal in natural gifts:  for he has a quickness of apprehension which is almost unrivalled, and he is exceedingly gentle, and also the most courageous of men; there is a union of qualities in him such as I have never seen in any other, and should scarcely have thought possible; for those who, like him, have quick and ready and retentive wits, have generally also quick tempers; they are ships without ballast, and go darting about, and are mad rather than courageous; and the steadier sort, when they have to face study, prove stupid and cannot remember.</div><div class="sentence"> Whereas he moves surely and smoothly and successfully in the path of knowledge and enquiry; and he is full of gentleness, flowing on silently like a river of oil; at his age, it is wonderful.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That is good news; whose son is he?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  The name of his father I have forgotten, but the youth himself is the middle one of those who are approaching us; he and his companions have been anointing themselves in the outer court, and now they seem to have finished, and are coming towards us.</div><div class="sentence"> Look and see whether you know him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I know the youth, but I do not know his name; he is the son of Euphronius the Sunian, who was himself an eminent man, and such another as his son is, according to your account of him; I believe that he left a considerable fortune.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Theaetetus, Socrates, is his name; but I rather think that the property disappeared in the hands of trustees; notwithstanding which he is wonderfully liberal.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He must be a fine fellow; tell him to come and sit by me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  I will.</div><div class="sentence"> Come hither, Theaetetus, and sit by Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  By all means, Theaetetus, in order that I may see the reflection of myself in your face, for Theodorus says that we are alike; and yet if each of us held in his hands a lyre, and he said that they were tuned alike, should we at once take his word, or should we ask whether he who said so was or was not a musician?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  We should ask.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if we found that he was, we should take his word; and if not, not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if this supposed likeness of our faces is a matter of any interest to us, we should enquire whether he who says that we are alike is a painter or not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly we should.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is Theodorus a painter?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I never heard that he was.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">040</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Is he a geometrician?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course he is, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is he an astronomer and calculator and musician, and in general an educated man?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">043</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I think so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">044</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  If, then, he remarks on a similarity in our persons, either by way of praise or blame, there is no particular reason why we should attend to him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should say not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">046</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if he praises the virtue or wisdom which are the mental endowments of either of us, then he who hears the praises will naturally desire to examine him who is praised:  and he again should be willing to exhibit himself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">047</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">048</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then now is the time, my dear Theaetetus, for me to examine, and for you to exhibit; since although Theodorus has praised many a citizen and stranger in my hearing, never did I hear him praise any one as he has been praising you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">049</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I am glad to hear it, Socrates; but what if he was only in jest?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">050</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Nay, Theodorus is not given to jesting; and I cannot allow you to retract your consent on any such pretence as that.</div><div class="sentence"> If you do, he will have to swear to his words; and we are perfectly sure that no one will be found to impugn him.</div><div class="sentence"> Do not be shy then, but stand to your word.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose I must, if you wish it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In the first place, I should like to ask what you learn of Theodorus:  something of geometry, perhaps?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And astronomy and harmony and calculation?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I do my best.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, my boy, and so do I; and my desire is to learn of him, or of anybody who seems to understand these things.</div><div class="sentence"> And I get on pretty well in general; but there is a little difficulty which I want you and the company to aid me in investigating.</div><div class="sentence"> Will you answer me a question:  'Is not learning growing wiser about that which you learn?'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And by wisdom the wise are wise?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is that different in any way from knowledge?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Wisdom; are not men wise in that which they know?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly they are.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then wisdom and knowledge are the same?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Herein lies the difficulty which I can never solve to my satisfaction—What is knowledge?</div><div class="sentence"> Can we answer that question?</div><div class="sentence"> What say you?</div><div class="sentence"> which of us will speak first?</div><div class="sentence"> whoever misses shall sit down, as at a game of ball, and shall be donkey, as the boys say; he who lasts out his competitors in the game without missing, shall be our king, and shall have the right of putting to us any questions which he pleases...Why is there no reply?</div><div class="sentence"> I hope, Theodorus, that I am not betrayed into rudeness by my love of conversation?</div><div class="sentence"> I only want to make us talk and be friendly and sociable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  The reverse of rudeness, Socrates:  but I would rather that you would ask one of the young fellows; for the truth is, that I am unused to your game of question and answer, and I am too old to learn; the young will be more suitable, and they will improve more than I shall, for youth is always able to improve.</div><div class="sentence"> And so having made a beginning with Theaetetus, I would advise you to go on with him and not let him off.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do you hear, Theaetetus, what Theodorus says?</div><div class="sentence"> The philosopher, whom you would not like to disobey, and whose word ought to be a command to a young man, bids me interrogate you.</div><div class="sentence"> Take courage, then, and nobly say what you think that knowledge is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Well, Socrates, I will answer as you and he bid me; and if I make a mistake, you will doubtless correct me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We will, if we can.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Then, I think that the sciences which I learn from Theodorus—geometry, and those which you just now mentioned—are knowledge; and I would include the art of the cobbler and other craftsmen; these, each and all of, them, are knowledge.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But that, Theaetetus, was not the point of my question:  we wanted to know not the subjects, nor yet the number of the arts or sciences, for we were not going to count them, but we wanted to know the nature of knowledge in the abstract.</div><div class="sentence"> Am I not right?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">081</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Perfectly right.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Theodorus was writing out for us something about roots, such as the roots of three or five, showing that they are incommensurable by the unit:  he selected other examples up to seventeen—there he stopped.</div><div class="sentence"> Now as there are innumerable roots, the notion occurred to us of attempting to include them all under one name or class.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And did you find such a class?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I think that we did; but I should like to have your opinion.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  We divided all numbers into two classes:  those which are made up of equal factors multiplying into one another, which we compared to square figures and called square or equilateral numbers;—that was one class.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  The intermediate numbers, such as three and five, and every other number which is made up of unequal factors, either of a greater multiplied by a less, or of a less multiplied by a greater, and when regarded as a figure, is contained in unequal sides;—all these we compared to oblong figures, and called them oblong numbers.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Capital; and what followed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">103</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  The lines, or sides, which have for their squares the equilateral plane numbers, were called by us lengths or magnitudes; and the lines which are the roots of (or whose squares are equal to) the oblong numbers, were called powers or roots; the reason of this latter name being, that they are commensurable with the former [i.e., with the so-called lengths or magnitudes] not in linear measurement, but in the value of the superficial content of their squares; and the same about solids.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Excellent, my boys; I think that you fully justify the praises of Theodorus, and that he will not be found guilty of false witness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  But I am unable, Socrates, to give you a similar answer about knowledge, which is what you appear to want; and therefore Theodorus is a deceiver after all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but if some one were to praise you for running, and to say that he never met your equal among boys, and afterwards you were beaten in a race by a grown-up man, who was a great runner—would the praise be any the less true?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is the discovery of the nature of knowledge so small a matter, as just now said?</div><div class="sentence"> Is it not one which would task the powers of men perfect in every way?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, be of good cheer; do not say that Theodorus was mistaken about you, but do your best to ascertain the true nature of knowledge, as well as of other things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">111</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I am eager enough, Socrates, if that would bring to light the truth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">112</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Come, you made a good beginning just now; let your own answer about roots be your model, and as you comprehended them all in one class, try and bring the many sorts of knowledge under one definition.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">113</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I can assure you, Socrates, that I have tried very often, when the report of questions asked by you was brought to me; but I can neither persuade myself that I have a satisfactory answer to give, nor hear of any one who answers as you would have him; and I cannot shake off a feeling of anxiety.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">114</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  These are the pangs of labour, my dear Theaetetus; you have something within you which you are bringing to the birth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">115</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I do not know, Socrates; I only say what I feel.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">116</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And have you never heard, simpleton, that I am the son of a midwife, brave and burly, whose name was Phaenarete?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">117</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I have.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">118</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And that I myself practise midwifery?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">119</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  No, never.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">120</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let me tell you that I do though, my friend:  but you must not reveal the secret, as the world in general have not found me out; and therefore they only say of me, that I am the strangest of mortals and drive men to their wits' end.</div><div class="sentence"> Did you ever hear that too?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">121</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">122</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Shall I tell you the reason?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">123</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">124</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Bear in mind the whole business of the midwives, and then you will see my meaning better: —No woman, as you are probably aware, who is still able to conceive and bear, attends other women, but only those who are past bearing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">125</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I know.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">126</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The reason of this is said to be that Artemis—the goddess of childbirth—is not a mother, and she honours those who are like herself; but she could not allow the barren to be midwives, because human nature cannot know the mystery of an art without experience; and therefore she assigned this office to those who are too old to bear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">127</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I dare say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">128</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And I dare say too, or rather I am absolutely certain, that the midwives know better than others who is pregnant and who is not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">129</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">130</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And by the use of potions and incantations they are able to arouse the pangs and to soothe them at will; they can make those bear who have a difficulty in bearing, and if they think fit they can smother the embryo in the womb.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">131</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  They can.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">132</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Did you ever remark that they are also most cunning matchmakers, and have a thorough knowledge of what unions are likely to produce a brave brood?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">133</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  No, never.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">134</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then let me tell you that this is their greatest pride, more than cutting the umbilical cord.</div><div class="sentence"> And if you reflect, you will see that the same art which cultivates and gathers in the fruits of the earth, will be most likely to know in what soils the several plants or seeds should be deposited.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">135</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, the same art.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">136</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do you suppose that with women the case is otherwise?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">137</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should think not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">138</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not; but midwives are respectable women who have a character to lose, and they avoid this department of their profession, because they are afraid of being called procuresses, which is a name given to those who join together man and woman in an unlawful and unscientific way; and yet the true midwife is also the true and only matchmaker.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">139</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">140</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Such are the midwives, whose task is a very important one, but not so important as mine; for women do not bring into the world at one time real children, and at another time counterfeits which are with difficulty distinguished from them; if they did, then the discernment of the true and false birth would be the crowning achievement of the art of midwifery—you would think so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">141</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Indeed I should.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">142</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, my art of midwifery is in most respects like theirs; but differs, in that I attend men and not women; and look after their souls when they are in labour, and not after their bodies:  and the triumph of my art is in thoroughly examining whether the thought which the mind of the young man brings forth is a false idol or a noble and true birth.</div><div class="sentence"> And like the midwives, I am barren, and the reproach which is often made against me, that I ask questions of others and have not the wit to answer them myself, is very just—the reason is, that the god compels me to be a midwife, but does not allow me to bring forth.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore I am not myself at all wise, nor have I anything to show which is the invention or birth of my own soul, but those who converse with me profit.</div><div class="sentence"> Some of them appear dull enough at first, but afterwards, as our acquaintance ripens, if the god is gracious to them, they all make astonishing progress; and this in the opinion of others as well as in their own.</div><div class="sentence"> It is quite clear that they never learned anything from me; the many fine discoveries to which they cling are of their own making.</div><div class="sentence"> But to me and the god they owe their delivery.</div><div class="sentence"> And the proof of my words is, that many of them in their ignorance, either in their self-conceit despising me, or falling under the influence of others, have gone away too soon; and have not only lost the children of whom I had previously delivered them by an ill bringing up, but have stifled whatever else they had in them by evil communications, being fonder of lies and shams than of the truth; and they have at last ended by seeing themselves, as others see them, to be great fools.</div><div class="sentence"> Aristeides, the son of Lysimachus, is one of them, and there are many others.</div><div class="sentence"> The truants often return to me, and beg that I would consort with them again—they are ready to go to me on their knees—and then, if my familiar allows, which is not always the case, I receive them, and they begin to grow again.</div><div class="sentence"> Dire are the pangs which my art is able to arouse and to allay in those who consort with me, just like the pangs of women in childbirth; night and day they are full of perplexity and travail which is even worse than that of the women.</div><div class="sentence"> So much for them.</div><div class="sentence"> And there are others, Theaetetus, who come to me apparently having nothing in them; and as I know that they have no need of my art, I coax them into marrying some one, and by the grace of God I can generally tell who is likely to do them good.</div><div class="sentence"> Many of them I have given away to Prodicus, and many to other inspired sages.</div><div class="sentence"> I tell you this long story, friend Theaetetus, because I suspect, as indeed you seem to think yourself, that you are in labour—great with some conception.</div><div class="sentence"> Come then to me, who am a midwife's son and myself a midwife, and do your best to answer the questions which I will ask you.</div><div class="sentence"> And if I abstract and expose your first-born, because I discover upon inspection that the conception which you have formed is a vain shadow, do not quarrel with me on that account, as the manner of women is when their first children are taken from them.</div><div class="sentence"> For I have actually known some who were ready to bite me when I deprived them of a darling folly; they did not perceive that I acted from goodwill, not knowing that no god is the enemy of man—that was not within the range of their ideas; neither am I their enemy in all this, but it would be wrong for me to admit falsehood, or to stifle the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> Once more, then, Theaetetus, I repeat my old question, 'What is knowledge?</div><div class="sentence"> '—and do not say that you cannot tell; but quit yourself like a man, and by the help of God you will be able to tell.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">143</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  At any rate, Socrates, after such an exhortation I should be ashamed of not trying to do my best.</div><div class="sentence"> Now he who knows perceives what he knows, and, as far as I can see at present, knowledge is perception.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">144</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Bravely said, boy; that is the way in which you should express your opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> And now, let us examine together this conception of yours, and see whether it is a true birth or a mere wind-egg: —You say that knowledge is perception?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">145</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">146</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, you have delivered yourself of a very important doctrine about knowledge; it is indeed the opinion of Protagoras, who has another way of expressing it.</div><div class="sentence"> Man, he says, is the measure of all things, of the existence of things that are, and of the non-existence of things that are not: —You have read him?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">147</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  O yes, again and again.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">148</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Does he not say that things are to you such as they appear to you, and to me such as they appear to me, and that you and I are men?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">152</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Now is the wind, regarded not in relation to us but absolutely, cold or not; or are we to say, with Protagoras, that the wind is cold to him who is cold, and not to him who is not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">153</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose the last.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">154</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then it must appear so to each of them?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">158</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then appearing and perceiving coincide in the case of hot and cold, and in similar instances; for things appear, or may be supposed to be, to each one such as he perceives them?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">211</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, indeed, Socrates, they are very hard and impenetrable mortals.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">212</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, my boy, outer barbarians.</div><div class="sentence"> Far more ingenious are the brethren whose mysteries I am about to reveal to you.</div><div class="sentence"> Their first principle is, that all is motion, and upon this all the affections of which we were just now speaking are supposed to depend:  there is nothing but motion, which has two forms, one active and the other passive, both in endless number; and out of the union and friction of them there is generated a progeny endless in number, having two forms, sense and the object of sense, which are ever breaking forth and coming to the birth at the same moment.</div><div class="sentence"> The senses are variously named hearing, seeing, smelling; there is the sense of heat, cold, pleasure, pain, desire, fear, and many more which have names, as well as innumerable others which are without them; each has its kindred object,—each variety of colour has a corresponding variety of sight, and so with sound and hearing, and with the rest of the senses and the objects akin to them.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you see, Theaetetus, the bearings of this tale on the preceding argument?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">213</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Indeed I do not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">214</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then attend, and I will try to finish the story.</div><div class="sentence"> The purport is that all these things are in motion, as I was saying, and that this motion is of two kinds, a slower and a quicker; and the slower elements have their motions in the same place and with reference to things near them, and so they beget; but what is begotten is swifter, for it is carried to fro, and moves from place to place.</div><div class="sentence"> Apply this to sense: —When the eye and the appropriate object meet together and give birth to whiteness and the sensation connatural with it, which could not have been given by either of them going elsewhere, then, while the sight is flowing from the eye, whiteness proceeds from the object which combines in producing the colour; and so the eye is fulfilled with sight, and really sees, and becomes, not sight, but a seeing eye; and the object which combined to form the colour is fulfilled with whiteness, and becomes not whiteness but a white thing, whether wood or stone or whatever the object may be which happens to be coloured white.</div><div class="sentence"> And this is true of all sensible objects, hard, warm, and the like, which are similarly to be regarded, as I was saying before, not as having any absolute existence, but as being all of them of whatever kind generated by motion in their intercourse with one another; for of the agent and patient, as existing in separation, no trustworthy conception, as they say, can be formed, for the agent has no existence until united with the patient, and the patient has no existence until united with the agent; and that which by uniting with something becomes an agent, by meeting with some other thing is converted into a patient.</div><div class="sentence"> And from all these considerations, as I said at first, there arises a general reflection, that there is no one self-existent thing, but everything is becoming and in relation; and being must be altogether abolished, although from habit and ignorance we are compelled even in this discussion to retain the use of the term.</div><div class="sentence"> But great philosophers tell us that we are not to allow either the word 'something,' or 'belonging to something,' or 'to me,' or 'this,' or 'that,' or any other detaining name to be used, in the language of nature all things are being created and destroyed, coming into being and passing into new forms; nor can any name fix or detain them; he who attempts to fix them is easily refuted.</div><div class="sentence"> And this should be the way of speaking, not only of particulars but of aggregates; such aggregates as are expressed in the word 'man,' or 'stone,' or any name of an animal or of a class.</div><div class="sentence"> O Theaetetus, are not these speculations sweet as honey?</div><div class="sentence"> And do you not like the taste of them in the mouth?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">215</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I do not know what to say, Socrates; for, indeed, I cannot make out whether you are giving your own opinion or only wanting to draw me out.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">216</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You forget, my friend, that I neither know, nor profess to know, anything of these matters; you are the person who is in labour, I am the barren midwife; and this is why I soothe you, and offer you one good thing after another, that you may taste them.</div><div class="sentence"> And I hope that I may at last help to bring your own opinion into the light of day:  when this has been accomplished, then we will determine whether what you have brought forth is only a wind-egg or a real and genuine birth.</div><div class="sentence"> Therefore, keep up your spirits, and answer like a man what you think.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">217</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Ask me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">218</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then once more:  Is it your opinion that nothing is but what becomes?—the good and the noble, as well as all the other things which we were just now mentioning?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">219</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  When I hear you discoursing in this style, I think that there is a great deal in what you say, and I am very ready to assent.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">220</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us not leave the argument unfinished, then; for there still remains to be considered an objection which may be raised about dreams and diseases, in particular about madness, and the various illusions of hearing and sight, or of other senses.</div><div class="sentence"> For you know that in all these cases the esse-percipi theory appears to be unmistakably refuted, since in dreams and illusions we certainly have false perceptions; and far from saying that everything is which appears, we should rather say that nothing is which appears.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">221</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">222</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But then, my boy, how can any one contend that knowledge is perception, or that to every man what appears is?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">223</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I am afraid to say, Socrates, that I have nothing to answer, because you rebuked me just now for making this excuse; but I certainly cannot undertake to argue that madmen or dreamers think truly, when they imagine, some of them that they are gods, and others that they can fly, and are flying in their sleep.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">224</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do you see another question which can be raised about these phenomena, notably about dreaming and waking?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">225</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  What question?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">226</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  A question which I think that you must often have heard persons ask: —How can you determine whether at this moment we are sleeping, and all our thoughts are a dream; or whether we are awake, and talking to one another in the waking state?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">227</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Indeed, Socrates, I do not know how to prove the one any more than the other, for in both cases the facts precisely correspond;—and there is no difficulty in supposing that during all this discussion we have been talking to one another in a dream; and when in a dream we seem to be narrating dreams, the resemblance of the two states is quite astonishing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">228</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You see, then, that a doubt about the reality of sense is easily raised, since there may even be a doubt whether we are awake or in a dream.</div><div class="sentence"> And as our time is equally divided between sleeping and waking, in either sphere of existence the soul contends that the thoughts which are present to our minds at the time are true; and during one half of our lives we affirm the truth of the one, and, during the other half, of the other; and are equally confident of both.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">229</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">230</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And may not the same be said of madness and other disorders?</div><div class="sentence"> the difference is only that the times are not equal.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">231</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">232</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is truth or falsehood to be determined by duration of time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">233</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  That would be in many ways ridiculous.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">234</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But can you certainly determine by any other means which of these opinions is true?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">235</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I do not think that I can.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">236</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Listen, then, to a statement of the other side of the argument, which is made by the champions of appearance.</div><div class="sentence"> They would say, as I imagine—Can that which is wholly other than something, have the same quality as that from which it differs?</div><div class="sentence"> and observe, Theaetetus, that the word 'other' means not 'partially,' but 'wholly other.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">237</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly, putting the question as you do, that which is wholly other cannot either potentially or in any other way be the same.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">238</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And must therefore be admitted to be unlike?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">239</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">240</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  If, then, anything happens to become like or unlike itself or another, when it becomes like we call it the same—when unlike, other?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">242</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Were we not saying that there are agents many and infinite, and patients many and infinite?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">244</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And also that different combinations will produce results which are not the same, but different?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">245</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">246</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us take you and me, or anything as an example: —There is Socrates in health, and Socrates sick—Are they like or unlike?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">247</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  You mean to compare Socrates in health as a whole, and Socrates in sickness as a whole?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">248</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly; that is my meaning.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">249</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I answer, they are unlike.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">250</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if unlike, they are other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">251</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">252</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And would you not say the same of Socrates sleeping and waking, or in any of the states which we were mentioning?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">253</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">254</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  All agents have a different patient in Socrates, accordingly as he is well or ill.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">255</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">256</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And I who am the patient, and that which is the agent, will produce something different in each of the two cases?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">258</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The wine which I drink when I am in health, appears sweet and pleasant to me?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">259</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">260</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  For, as has been already acknowledged, the patient and agent meet together and produce sweetness and a perception of sweetness, which are in simultaneous motion, and the perception which comes from the patient makes the tongue percipient, and the quality of sweetness which arises out of and is moving about the wine, makes the wine both to be and to appear sweet to the healthy tongue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">261</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly; that has been already acknowledged.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">262</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But when I am sick, the wine really acts upon another and a different person?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">263</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">264</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The combination of the draught of wine, and the Socrates who is sick, produces quite another result; which is the sensation of bitterness in the tongue, and the motion and creation of bitterness in and about the wine, which becomes not bitterness but something bitter; as I myself become not perception but percipient?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">265</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">266</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There is no other object of which I shall ever have the same perception, for another object would give another perception, and would make the percipient other and different; nor can that object which affects me, meeting another subject, produce the same, or become similar, for that too would produce another result from another subject, and become different.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">267</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">268</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Neither can I by myself, have this sensation, nor the object by itself, this quality.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">270</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  When I perceive I must become percipient of something—there can be no such thing as perceiving and perceiving nothing; the object, whether it become sweet, bitter, or of any other quality, must have relation to a percipient; nothing can become sweet which is sweet to no one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">271</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">272</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then the inference is, that we (the agent and patient) are or become in relation to one another; there is a law which binds us one to the other, but not to any other existence, nor each of us to himself; and therefore we can only be bound to one another; so that whether a person says that a thing is or becomes, he must say that it is or becomes to or of or in relation to something else; but he must not say or allow any one else to say that anything is or becomes absolutely: —such is our conclusion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">273</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">274</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, if that which acts upon me has relation to me and to no other, I and no other am the percipient of it?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">280</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then you were quite right in affirming that knowledge is only perception; and the meaning turns out to be the same, whether with Homer and Heracleitus, and all that company, you say that all is motion and flux, or with the great sage Protagoras, that man is the measure of all things; or with Theaetetus, that, given these premises, perception is knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> Am I not right, Theaetetus, and is not this your new-born child, of which I have delivered you?</div><div class="sentence"> What say you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">281</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I cannot but agree, Socrates.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">284</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You, Theodorus, are a lover of theories, and now you innocently fancy that I am a bag full of them, and can easily pull one out which will overthrow its predecessor.</div><div class="sentence"> But you do not see that in reality none of these theories come from me; they all come from him who talks with me.</div><div class="sentence"> I only know just enough to extract them from the wisdom of another, and to receive them in a spirit of fairness.</div><div class="sentence"> And now I shall say nothing myself, but shall endeavour to elicit something from our young friend.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">285</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Do as you say, Socrates; you are quite right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">286</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Shall I tell you, Theodorus, what amazes me in your acquaintance Protagoras?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">287</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">288</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I am charmed with his doctrine, that what appears is to each one, but I wonder that he did not begin his book on Truth with a declaration that a pig or a dog-faced baboon, or some other yet stranger monster which has sensation, is the measure of all things; then he might have shown a magnificent contempt for our opinion of him by informing us at the outset that while we were reverencing him like a God for his wisdom he was no better than a tadpole, not to speak of his fellow-men—would not this have produced an overpowering effect?</div><div class="sentence"> For if truth is only sensation, and no man can discern another's feelings better than he, or has any superior right to determine whether his opinion is true or false, but each, as we have several times repeated, is to himself the sole judge, and everything that he judges is true and right, why, my friend, should Protagoras be preferred to the place of wisdom and instruction, and deserve to be well paid, and we poor ignoramuses have to go to him, if each one is the measure of his own wisdom?</div><div class="sentence"> Must he not be talking 'ad captandum' in all this?</div><div class="sentence"> I say nothing of the ridiculous predicament in which my own midwifery and the whole art of dialectic is placed; for the attempt to supervise or refute the notions or opinions of others would be a tedious and enormous piece of folly, if to each man his own are right; and this must be the case if Protagoras' Truth is the real truth, and the philosopher is not merely amusing himself by giving oracles out of the shrine of his book.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">289</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  He was a friend of mine, Socrates, as you were saying, and therefore I cannot have him refuted by my lips, nor can I oppose you when I agree with you; please, then, to take Theaetetus again; he seemed to answer very nicely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">290</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  If you were to go into a Lacedaemonian palestra, Theodorus, would you have a right to look on at the naked wrestlers, some of them making a poor figure, if you did not strip and give them an opportunity of judging of your own person?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">292</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Your will is my will, Theodorus, as the proverbial philosophers say, and therefore I will return to the sage Theaetetus:  Tell me, Theaetetus, in reference to what I was saying, are you not lost in wonder, like myself, when you find that all of a sudden you are raised to the level of the wisest of men, or indeed of the gods?—for you would assume the measure of Protagoras to apply to the gods as well as men?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">293</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly I should, and I confess to you that I am lost in wonder.</div><div class="sentence"> At first hearing, I was quite satisfied with the doctrine, that whatever appears is to each one, but now the face of things has changed.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">295</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  But neither you nor we, Socrates, would be satisfied with such arguments.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">298</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the way will be to ask whether perception is or is not the same as knowledge; for this was the real point of our argument, and with a view to this we raised (did we not?)</div><div class="sentence"> those many strange questions.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">299</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">300</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Shall we say that we know every thing which we see and hear?</div><div class="sentence"> for example, shall we say that not having learned, we do not hear the language of foreigners when they speak to us?</div><div class="sentence"> or shall we say that we not only hear, but know what they are saying?</div><div class="sentence"> Or again, if we see letters which we do not understand, shall we say that we do not see them?</div><div class="sentence"> or shall we aver that, seeing them, we must know them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">301</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  We shall say, Socrates, that we know what we actually see and hear of them—that is to say, we see and know the figure and colour of the letters, and we hear and know the elevation or depression of the sound of them; but we do not perceive by sight and hearing, or know, that which grammarians and interpreters teach about them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">302</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Capital, Theaetetus; and about this there shall be no dispute, because I want you to grow; but there is another difficulty coming, which you will also have to repulse.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">303</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">304</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Some one will say, Can a man who has ever known anything, and still has and preserves a memory of that which he knows, not know that which he remembers at the time when he remembers?</div><div class="sentence"> I have, I fear, a tedious way of putting a simple question, which is only, whether a man who has learned, and remembers, can fail to know?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">305</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Impossible, Socrates; the supposition is monstrous.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">310</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And you would admit that there is such a thing as memory?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">319</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Who, Socrates, would dare to say so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">320</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But we must say so, if the previous argument is to be maintained.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">322</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  As thus:  he who sees knows, as we say, that which he sees; for perception and sight and knowledge are admitted to be the same.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">324</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But he who saw, and has knowledge of that which he saw, remembers, when he closes his eyes, that which he no longer sees.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">326</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And seeing is knowing, and therefore not-seeing is not-knowing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">327</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">328</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then the inference is, that a man may have attained the knowledge of something, which he may remember and yet not know, because he does not see; and this has been affirmed by us to be a monstrous supposition.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">330</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Thus, then, the assertion that knowledge and perception are one, involves a manifest impossibility?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">334</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Once more we shall have to begin, and ask 'What is knowledge?'</div><div class="sentence"> and yet, Theaetetus, what are we going to do?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">336</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Like a good-for-nothing cock, without having won the victory, we walk away from the argument and crow.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">337</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  How do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">338</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  After the manner of disputers (Lys.</div><div class="sentence"> ; Phaedo; Republic), we were satisfied with mere verbal consistency, and were well pleased if in this way we could gain an advantage.</div><div class="sentence"> Although professing not to be mere Eristics, but philosophers, I suspect that we have unconsciously fallen into the error of that ingenious class of persons.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">339</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I do not as yet understand you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">340</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then I will try to explain myself:  just now we asked the question, whether a man who had learned and remembered could fail to know, and we showed that a person who had seen might remember when he had his eyes shut and could not see, and then he would at the same time remember and not know.</div><div class="sentence"> But this was an impossibility.</div><div class="sentence"> And so the Protagorean fable came to nought, and yours also, who maintained that knowledge is the same as perception.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">341</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">342</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet, my friend, I rather suspect that the result would have been different if Protagoras, who was the father of the first of the two brats, had been alive; he would have had a great deal to say on their behalf.</div><div class="sentence"> But he is dead, and we insult over his orphan child; and even the guardians whom he left, and of whom our friend Theodorus is one, are unwilling to give any help, and therefore I suppose that I must take up his cause myself, and see justice done?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">343</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Not I, Socrates, but rather Callias, the son of Hipponicus, is guardian of his orphans.</div><div class="sentence"> I was too soon diverted from the abstractions of dialectic to geometry.</div><div class="sentence"> Nevertheless, I shall be grateful to you if you assist him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">344</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good, Theodorus; you shall see how I will come to the rescue.</div><div class="sentence"> If a person does not attend to the meaning of terms as they are commonly used in argument, he may be involved even in greater paradoxes than these.</div><div class="sentence"> Shall I explain this matter to you or to Theaetetus?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">345</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  To both of us, and let the younger answer; he will incur less disgrace if he is discomfited.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">346</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then now let me ask the awful question, which is this: —Can a man know and also not know that which he knows?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">347</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  How shall we answer, Theaetetus?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">348</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  He cannot, I should say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">349</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He can, if you maintain that seeing is knowing.</div><div class="sentence"> When you are imprisoned in a well, as the saying is, and the self-assured adversary closes one of your eyes with his hand, and asks whether you can see his cloak with the eye which he has closed, how will you answer the inevitable man?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">350</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should answer, 'Not with that eye but with the other.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">351</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then you see and do not see the same thing at the same time.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">352</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, in a certain sense.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">353</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  None of that, he will reply; I do not ask or bid you answer in what sense you know, but only whether you know that which you do not know.</div><div class="sentence"> You have been proved to see that which you do not see; and you have already admitted that seeing is knowing, and that not-seeing is not-knowing:  I leave you to draw the inference.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">354</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; the inference is the contradictory of my assertion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">355</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, my marvel, and there might have been yet worse things in store for you, if an opponent had gone on to ask whether you can have a sharp and also a dull knowledge, and whether you can know near, but not at a distance, or know the same thing with more or less intensity, and so on without end.</div><div class="sentence"> Such questions might have been put to you by a light-armed mercenary, who argued for pay.</div><div class="sentence"> He would have lain in wait for you, and when you took up the position, that sense is knowledge, he would have made an assault upon hearing, smelling, and the other senses;—he would have shown you no mercy; and while you were lost in envy and admiration of his wisdom, he would have got you into his net, out of which you would not have escaped until you had come to an understanding about the sum to be paid for your release.</div><div class="sentence"> Well, you ask, and how will Protagoras reinforce his position?</div><div class="sentence"> Shall I answer for him?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">356</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">357</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He will repeat all those things which we have been urging on his behalf, and then he will close with us in disdain, and say: —The worthy Socrates asked a little boy, whether the same man could remember and not know the same thing, and the boy said No, because he was frightened, and could not see what was coming, and then Socrates made fun of poor me.</div><div class="sentence"> The truth is, O slatternly Socrates, that when you ask questions about any assertion of mine, and the person asked is found tripping, if he has answered as I should have answered, then I am refuted, but if he answers something else, then he is refuted and not I.</div><div class="sentence"> For do you really suppose that any one would admit the memory which a man has of an impression which has passed away to be the same with that which he experienced at the time?</div><div class="sentence"> Assuredly not.</div><div class="sentence"> Or would he hesitate to acknowledge that the same man may know and not know the same thing?</div><div class="sentence"> Or, if he is afraid of making this admission, would he ever grant that one who has become unlike is the same as before he became unlike?</div><div class="sentence"> Or would he admit that a man is one at all, and not rather many and infinite as the changes which take place in him?</div><div class="sentence"> I speak by the card in order to avoid entanglements of words.</div><div class="sentence"> But, O my good sir, he will say, come to the argument in a more generous spirit; and either show, if you can, that our sensations are not relative and individual, or, if you admit them to be so, prove that this does not involve the consequence that the appearance becomes, or, if you will have the word, is, to the individual only.</div><div class="sentence"> As to your talk about pigs and baboons, you are yourself behaving like a pig, and you teach your hearers to make sport of my writings in the same ignorant manner; but this is not to your credit.</div><div class="sentence"> For I declare that the truth is as I have written, and that each of us is a measure of existence and of non-existence.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet one man may be a thousand times better than another in proportion as different things are and appear to him.</div><div class="sentence"> And I am far from saying that wisdom and the wise man have no existence; but I say that the wise man is he who makes the evils which appear and are to a man, into goods which are and appear to him.</div><div class="sentence"> And I would beg you not to press my words in the letter, but to take the meaning of them as I will explain them.</div><div class="sentence"> Remember what has been already said,—that to the sick man his food appears to be and is bitter, and to the man in health the opposite of bitter.</div><div class="sentence"> Now I cannot conceive that one of these men can be or ought to be made wiser than the other:  nor can you assert that the sick man because he has one impression is foolish, and the healthy man because he has another is wise; but the one state requires to be changed into the other, the worse into the better.</div><div class="sentence"> As in education, a change of state has to be effected, and the sophist accomplishes by words the change which the physician works by the aid of drugs.</div><div class="sentence"> Not that any one ever made another think truly, who previously thought falsely.</div><div class="sentence"> For no one can think what is not, or, think anything different from that which he feels; and this is always true.</div><div class="sentence"> But as the inferior habit of mind has thoughts of kindred nature, so I conceive that a good mind causes men to have good thoughts; and these which the inexperienced call true, I maintain to be only better, and not truer than others.</div><div class="sentence"> And, O my dear Socrates, I do not call wise men tadpoles:  far from it; I say that they are the physicians of the human body, and the husbandmen of plants—for the husbandmen also take away the evil and disordered sensations of plants, and infuse into them good and healthy sensations—aye and true ones; and the wise and good rhetoricians make the good instead of the evil to seem just to states; for whatever appears to a state to be just and fair, so long as it is regarded as such, is just and fair to it; but the teacher of wisdom causes the good to take the place of the evil, both in appearance and in reality.</div><div class="sentence"> And in like manner the Sophist who is able to train his pupils in this spirit is a wise man, and deserves to be well paid by them.</div><div class="sentence"> And so one man is wiser than another; and no one thinks falsely, and you, whether you will or not, must endure to be a measure.</div><div class="sentence"> On these foundations the argument stands firm, which you, Socrates, may, if you please, overthrow by an opposite argument, or if you like you may put questions to me—a method to which no intelligent person will object, quite the reverse.</div><div class="sentence"> But I must beg you to put fair questions:  for there is great inconsistency in saying that you have a zeal for virtue, and then always behaving unfairly in argument.</div><div class="sentence"> The unfairness of which I complain is that you do not distinguish between mere disputation and dialectic:  the disputer may trip up his opponent as often as he likes, and make fun; but the dialectician will be in earnest, and only correct his adversary when necessary, telling him the errors into which he has fallen through his own fault, or that of the company which he has previously kept.</div><div class="sentence"> If you do so, your adversary will lay the blame of his own confusion and perplexity on himself, and not on you.</div><div class="sentence"> He will follow and love you, and will hate himself, and escape from himself into philosophy, in order that he may become different from what he was.</div><div class="sentence"> But the other mode of arguing, which is practised by the many, will have just the opposite effect upon him; and as he grows older, instead of turning philosopher, he will come to hate philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> I would recommend you, therefore, as I said before, not to encourage yourself in this polemical and controversial temper, but to find out, in a friendly and congenial spirit, what we really mean when we say that all things are in motion, and that to every individual and state what appears, is.</div><div class="sentence"> In this manner you will consider whether knowledge and sensation are the same or different, but you will not argue, as you were just now doing, from the customary use of names and words, which the vulgar pervert in all sorts of ways, causing infinite perplexity to one another.</div><div class="sentence"> Such, Theodorus, is the very slight help which I am able to offer to your old friend; had he been living, he would have helped himself in a far more gloriose style.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">358</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  You are jesting, Socrates; indeed, your defence of him has been most valorous.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">359</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Thank you, friend; and I hope that you observed Protagoras bidding us be serious, as the text, 'Man is the measure of all things,' was a solemn one; and he reproached us with making a boy the medium of discourse, and said that the boy's timidity was made to tell against his argument; he also declared that we made a joke of him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">360</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  How could I fail to observe all that, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">361</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, and shall we do as he says?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">362</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">363</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if his wishes are to be regarded, you and I must take up the argument, and in all seriousness, and ask and answer one another, for you see that the rest of us are nothing but boys.</div><div class="sentence"> In no other way can we escape the imputation, that in our fresh analysis of his thesis we are making fun with boys.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">364</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but is not Theaetetus better able to follow a philosophical enquiry than a great many men who have long beards?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">365</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Theodorus, but not better than you; and therefore please not to imagine that I am to defend by every means in my power your departed friend; and that you are to defend nothing and nobody.</div><div class="sentence"> At any rate, my good man, do not sheer off until we know whether you are a true measure of diagrams, or whether all men are equally measures and sufficient for themselves in astronomy and geometry, and the other branches of knowledge in which you are supposed to excel them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">366</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  He who is sitting by you, Socrates, will not easily avoid being drawn into an argument; and when I said just now that you would excuse me, and not, like the Lacedaemonians, compel me to strip and fight, I was talking nonsense—I should rather compare you to Scirrhon, who threw travellers from the rocks; for the Lacedaemonian rule is 'strip or depart,' but you seem to go about your work more after the fashion of Antaeus:  you will not allow any one who approaches you to depart until you have stripped him, and he has been compelled to try a fall with you in argument.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">367</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There, Theodorus, you have hit off precisely the nature of my complaint; but I am even more pugnacious than the giants of old, for I have met with no end of heroes; many a Heracles, many a Theseus, mighty in words, has broken my head; nevertheless I am always at this rough exercise, which inspires me like a passion.</div><div class="sentence"> Please, then, to try a fall with me, whereby you will do yourself good as well as me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">368</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  I consent; lead me whither you will, for I know that you are like destiny; no man can escape from any argument which you may weave for him.</div><div class="sentence"> But I am not disposed to go further than you suggest.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">369</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Once will be enough; and now take particular care that we do not again unwittingly expose ourselves to the reproach of talking childishly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">370</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  I will do my best to avoid that error.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">371</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In the first place, let us return to our old objection, and see whether we were right in blaming and taking offence at Protagoras on the ground that he assumed all to be equal and sufficient in wisdom; although he admitted that there was a better and worse, and that in respect of this, some who as he said were the wise excelled others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">372</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">373</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Had Protagoras been living and answered for himself, instead of our answering for him, there would have been no need of our reviewing or reinforcing the argument.</div><div class="sentence"> But as he is not here, and some one may accuse us of speaking without authority on his behalf, had we not better come to a clearer agreement about his meaning, for a great deal may be at stake?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">374</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">375</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then let us obtain, not through any third person, but from his own statement and in the fewest words possible, the basis of agreement.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">376</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  In what way?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">377</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In this way: —His words are, 'What seems to a man, is to him.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">378</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, so he says.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">379</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And are not we, Protagoras, uttering the opinion of man, or rather of all mankind, when we say that every one thinks himself wiser than other men in some things, and their inferior in others?</div><div class="sentence"> In the hour of danger, when they are in perils of war, or of the sea, or of sickness, do they not look up to their commanders as if they were gods, and expect salvation from them, only because they excel them in knowledge?</div><div class="sentence"> Is not the world full of men in their several employments, who are looking for teachers and rulers of themselves and of the animals?</div><div class="sentence"> and there are plenty who think that they are able to teach and able to rule.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, in all this is implied that ignorance and wisdom exist among them, at least in their own opinion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">380</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">381</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And wisdom is assumed by them to be true thought, and ignorance to be false opinion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">382</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">383</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How then, Protagoras, would you have us treat the argument?</div><div class="sentence"> Shall we say that the opinions of men are always true, or sometimes true and sometimes false?</div><div class="sentence"> In either case, the result is the same, and their opinions are not always true, but sometimes true and sometimes false.</div><div class="sentence"> For tell me, Theodorus, do you suppose that you yourself, or any other follower of Protagoras, would contend that no one deems another ignorant or mistaken in his opinion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">384</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  The thing is incredible, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">385</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet that absurdity is necessarily involved in the thesis which declares man to be the measure of all things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">386</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">387</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, suppose that you determine in your own mind something to be true, and declare your opinion to me; let us assume, as he argues, that this is true to you.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, if so, you must either say that the rest of us are not the judges of this opinion or judgment of yours, or that we judge you always to have a true opinion?</div><div class="sentence"> But are there not thousands upon thousands who, whenever you form a judgment, take up arms against you and are of an opposite judgment and opinion, deeming that you judge falsely?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">388</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, indeed, Socrates, thousands and tens of thousands, as Homer says, who give me a world of trouble.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">389</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but are we to assert that what you think is true to you and false to the ten thousand others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">390</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  No other inference seems to be possible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">391</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And how about Protagoras himself?</div><div class="sentence"> If neither he nor the multitude thought, as indeed they do not think, that man is the measure of all things, must it not follow that the truth of which Protagoras wrote would be true to no one?</div><div class="sentence"> But if you suppose that he himself thought this, and that the multitude does not agree with him, you must begin by allowing that in whatever proportion the many are more than one, in that proportion his truth is more untrue than true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">392</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  That would follow if the truth is supposed to vary with individual opinion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">393</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the best of the joke is, that he acknowledges the truth of their opinion who believe his own opinion to be false; for he admits that the opinions of all men are true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">394</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">395</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And does he not allow that his own opinion is false, if he admits that the opinion of those who think him false is true?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">396</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">397</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Whereas the other side do not admit that they speak falsely?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">398</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  They do not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">399</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And he, as may be inferred from his writings, agrees that this opinion is also true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">400</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">401</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then all mankind, beginning with Protagoras, will contend, or rather, I should say that he will allow, when he concedes that his adversary has a true opinion—Protagoras, I say, will himself allow that neither a dog nor any ordinary man is the measure of anything which he has not learned—am I not right?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">402</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">403</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the truth of Protagoras being doubted by all, will be true neither to himself to any one else?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">404</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  I think, Socrates, that we are running my old friend too hard.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">405</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But I do not know that we are going beyond the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> Doubtless, as he is older, he may be expected to be wiser than we are.</div><div class="sentence"> And if he could only just get his head out of the world below, he would have overthrown both of us again and again, me for talking nonsense and you for assenting to me, and have been off and underground in a trice.</div><div class="sentence"> But as he is not within call, we must make the best use of our own faculties, such as they are, and speak out what appears to us to be true.</div><div class="sentence"> And one thing which no one will deny is, that there are great differences in the understandings of men.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">406</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  In that opinion I quite agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">407</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is there not most likely to be firm ground in the distinction which we were indicating on behalf of Protagoras, viz.</div><div class="sentence"> that most things, and all immediate sensations, such as hot, dry, sweet, are only such as they appear; if however difference of opinion is to be allowed at all, surely we must allow it in respect of health or disease?</div><div class="sentence"> for every woman, child, or living creature has not such a knowledge of what conduces to health as to enable them to cure themselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">408</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  I quite agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">409</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Or again, in politics, while affirming that just and unjust, honourable and disgraceful, holy and unholy, are in reality to each state such as the state thinks and makes lawful, and that in determining these matters no individual or state is wiser than another, still the followers of Protagoras will not deny that in determining what is or is not expedient for the community one state is wiser and one counsellor better than another—they will scarcely venture to maintain, that what a city enacts in the belief that it is expedient will always be really expedient.</div><div class="sentence"> But in the other case, I mean when they speak of justice and injustice, piety and impiety, they are confident that in nature these have no existence or essence of their own—the truth is that which is agreed on at the time of the agreement, and as long as the agreement lasts; and this is the philosophy of many who do not altogether go along with Protagoras.</div><div class="sentence"> Here arises a new question, Theodorus, which threatens to be more serious than the last.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">410</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Well, Socrates, we have plenty of leisure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">411</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That is true, and your remark recalls to my mind an observation which I have often made, that those who have passed their days in the pursuit of philosophy are ridiculously at fault when they have to appear and speak in court.</div><div class="sentence"> How natural is this!</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">412</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">413</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I mean to say, that those who have been trained in philosophy and liberal pursuits are as unlike those who from their youth upwards have been knocking about in the courts and such places, as a freeman is in breeding unlike a slave.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">414</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  In what is the difference seen?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">415</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In the leisure spoken of by you, which a freeman can always command:  he has his talk out in peace, and, like ourselves, he wanders at will from one subject to another, and from a second to a third,—if the fancy takes him, he begins again, as we are doing now, caring not whether his words are many or few; his only aim is to attain the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> But the lawyer is always in a hurry; there is the water of the clepsydra driving him on, and not allowing him to expatiate at will:  and there is his adversary standing over him, enforcing his rights; the indictment, which in their phraseology is termed the affidavit, is recited at the time:  and from this he must not deviate.</div><div class="sentence"> He is a servant, and is continually disputing about a fellow-servant before his master, who is seated, and has the cause in his hands; the trial is never about some indifferent matter, but always concerns himself; and often the race is for his life.</div><div class="sentence"> The consequence has been, that he has become keen and shrewd; he has learned how to flatter his master in word and indulge him in deed; but his soul is small and unrighteous.</div><div class="sentence"> His condition, which has been that of a slave from his youth upwards, has deprived him of growth and uprightness and independence; dangers and fears, which were too much for his truth and honesty, came upon him in early years, when the tenderness of youth was unequal to them, and he has been driven into crooked ways; from the first he has practised deception and retaliation, and has become stunted and warped.</div><div class="sentence"> And so he has passed out of youth into manhood, having no soundness in him; and is now, as he thinks, a master in wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> Such is the lawyer, Theodorus.</div><div class="sentence"> Will you have the companion picture of the philosopher, who is of our brotherhood; or shall we return to the argument?</div><div class="sentence"> Do not let us abuse the freedom of digression which we claim.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">416</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Nay, Socrates, not until we have finished what we are about; for you truly said that we belong to a brotherhood which is free, and are not the servants of the argument; but the argument is our servant, and must wait our leisure.</div><div class="sentence"> Who is our judge?</div><div class="sentence"> Or where is the spectator having any right to censure or control us, as he might the poets?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">417</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, as this is your wish, I will describe the leaders; for there is no use in talking about the inferior sort.</div><div class="sentence"> In the first place, the lords of philosophy have never, from their youth upwards, known their way to the Agora, or the dicastery, or the council, or any other political assembly; they neither see nor hear the laws or decrees, as they are called, of the state written or recited; the eagerness of political societies in the attainment of offices—clubs, and banquets, and revels, and singing-maidens,—do not enter even into their dreams.</div><div class="sentence"> Whether any event has turned out well or ill in the city, what disgrace may have descended to any one from his ancestors, male or female, are matters of which the philosopher no more knows than he can tell, as they say, how many pints are contained in the ocean.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither is he conscious of his ignorance.</div><div class="sentence"> For he does not hold aloof in order that he may gain a reputation; but the truth is, that the outer form of him only is in the city:  his mind, disdaining the littlenesses and nothingnesses of human things, is 'flying all abroad' as Pindar says, measuring earth and heaven and the things which are under and on the earth and above the heaven, interrogating the whole nature of each and all in their entirety, but not condescending to anything which is within reach.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">418</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">419</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I will illustrate my meaning, Theodorus, by the jest which the clever witty Thracian handmaid is said to have made about Thales, when he fell into a well as he was looking up at the stars.</div><div class="sentence"> She said, that he was so eager to know what was going on in heaven, that he could not see what was before his feet.</div><div class="sentence"> This is a jest which is equally applicable to all philosophers.</div><div class="sentence"> For the philosopher is wholly unacquainted with his next-door neighbour; he is ignorant, not only of what he is doing, but he hardly knows whether he is a man or an animal; he is searching into the essence of man, and busy in enquiring what belongs to such a nature to do or suffer different from any other;—I think that you understand me, Theodorus?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">420</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  I do, and what you say is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">421</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And thus, my friend, on every occasion, private as well as public, as I said at first, when he appears in a law-court, or in any place in which he has to speak of things which are at his feet and before his eyes, he is the jest, not only of Thracian handmaids but of the general herd, tumbling into wells and every sort of disaster through his inexperience.</div><div class="sentence"> His awkwardness is fearful, and gives the impression of imbecility.</div><div class="sentence"> When he is reviled, he has nothing personal to say in answer to the civilities of his adversaries, for he knows no scandals of any one, and they do not interest him; and therefore he is laughed at for his sheepishness; and when others are being praised and glorified, in the simplicity of his heart he cannot help going into fits of laughter, so that he seems to be a downright idiot.</div><div class="sentence"> When he hears a tyrant or king eulogized, he fancies that he is listening to the praises of some keeper of cattle—a swineherd, or shepherd, or perhaps a cowherd, who is congratulated on the quantity of milk which he squeezes from them; and he remarks that the creature whom they tend, and out of whom they squeeze the wealth, is of a less tractable and more insidious nature.</div><div class="sentence"> Then, again, he observes that the great man is of necessity as ill-mannered and uneducated as any shepherd—for he has no leisure, and he is surrounded by a wall, which is his mountain-pen.</div><div class="sentence"> Hearing of enormous landed proprietors of ten thousand acres and more, our philosopher deems this to be a trifle, because he has been accustomed to think of the whole earth; and when they sing the praises of family, and say that some one is a gentleman because he can show seven generations of wealthy ancestors, he thinks that their sentiments only betray a dull and narrow vision in those who utter them, and who are not educated enough to look at the whole, nor to consider that every man has had thousands and ten thousands of progenitors, and among them have been rich and poor, kings and slaves, Hellenes and barbarians, innumerable.</div><div class="sentence"> And when people pride themselves on having a pedigree of twenty-five ancestors, which goes back to Heracles, the son of Amphitryon, he cannot understand their poverty of ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> Why are they unable to calculate that Amphitryon had a twenty-fifth ancestor, who might have been anybody, and was such as fortune made him, and he had a fiftieth, and so on?</div><div class="sentence"> He amuses himself with the notion that they cannot count, and thinks that a little arithmetic would have got rid of their senseless vanity.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, in all these cases our philosopher is derided by the vulgar, partly because he is thought to despise them, and also because he is ignorant of what is before him, and always at a loss.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">422</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is very true, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">423</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But, O my friend, when he draws the other into upper air, and gets him out of his pleas and rejoinders into the contemplation of justice and injustice in their own nature and in their difference from one another and from all other things; or from the commonplaces about the happiness of a king or of a rich man to the consideration of government, and of human happiness and misery in general—what they are, and how a man is to attain the one and avoid the other—when that narrow, keen, little legal mind is called to account about all this, he gives the philosopher his revenge; for dizzied by the height at which he is hanging, whence he looks down into space, which is a strange experience to him, he being dismayed, and lost, and stammering broken words, is laughed at, not by Thracian handmaidens or any other uneducated persons, for they have no eye for the situation, but by every man who has not been brought up a slave.</div><div class="sentence"> Such are the two characters, Theodorus:  the one of the freeman, who has been trained in liberty and leisure, whom you call the philosopher,—him we cannot blame because he appears simple and of no account when he has to perform some menial task, such as packing up bed-clothes, or flavouring a sauce or fawning speech; the other character is that of the man who is able to do all this kind of service smartly and neatly, but knows not how to wear his cloak like a gentleman; still less with the music of discourse can he hymn the true life aright which is lived by immortals or men blessed of heaven.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">424</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  If you could only persuade everybody, Socrates, as you do me, of the truth of your words, there would be more peace and fewer evils among men.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">425</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Evils, Theodorus, can never pass away; for there must always remain something which is antagonistic to good.</div><div class="sentence"> Having no place among the gods in heaven, of necessity they hover around the mortal nature, and this earthly sphere.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore we ought to fly away from earth to heaven as quickly as we can; and to fly away is to become like God, as far as this is possible; and to become like him, is to become holy, just, and wise.</div><div class="sentence"> But, O my friend, you cannot easily convince mankind that they should pursue virtue or avoid vice, not merely in order that a man may seem to be good, which is the reason given by the world, and in my judgment is only a repetition of an old wives' fable.</div><div class="sentence"> Whereas, the truth is that God is never in any way unrighteous—he is perfect righteousness; and he of us who is the most righteous is most like him.</div><div class="sentence"> Herein is seen the true cleverness of a man, and also his nothingness and want of manhood.</div><div class="sentence"> For to know this is true wisdom and virtue, and ignorance of this is manifest folly and vice.</div><div class="sentence"> All other kinds of wisdom or cleverness, which seem only, such as the wisdom of politicians, or the wisdom of the arts, are coarse and vulgar.</div><div class="sentence"> The unrighteous man, or the sayer and doer of unholy things, had far better not be encouraged in the illusion that his roguery is clever; for men glory in their shame—they fancy that they hear others saying of them, 'These are not mere good-for-nothing persons, mere burdens of the earth, but such as men should be who mean to dwell safely in a state.'</div><div class="sentence"> Let us tell them that they are all the more truly what they do not think they are because they do not know it; for they do not know the penalty of injustice, which above all things they ought to know—not stripes and death, as they suppose, which evil-doers often escape, but a penalty which cannot be escaped.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">426</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">427</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There are two patterns eternally set before them; the one blessed and divine, the other godless and wretched:  but they do not see them, or perceive that in their utter folly and infatuation they are growing like the one and unlike the other, by reason of their evil deeds; and the penalty is, that they lead a life answering to the pattern which they are growing like.</div><div class="sentence"> And if we tell them, that unless they depart from their cunning, the place of innocence will not receive them after death; and that here on earth, they will live ever in the likeness of their own evil selves, and with evil friends—when they hear this they in their superior cunning will seem to be listening to the talk of idiots.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">428</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">429</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Too true, my friend, as I well know; there is, however, one peculiarity in their case:  when they begin to reason in private about their dislike of philosophy, if they have the courage to hear the argument out, and do not run away, they grow at last strangely discontented with themselves; their rhetoric fades away, and they become helpless as children.</div><div class="sentence"> These however are digressions from which we must now desist, or they will overflow, and drown the original argument; to which, if you please, we will now return.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">430</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  For my part, Socrates, I would rather have the digressions, for at my age I find them easier to follow; but if you wish, let us go back to the argument.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">431</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Had we not reached the point at which the partisans of the perpetual flux, who say that things are as they seem to each one, were confidently maintaining that the ordinances which the state commanded and thought just, were just to the state which imposed them, while they were in force; this was especially asserted of justice; but as to the good, no one had any longer the hardihood to contend of any ordinances which the state thought and enacted to be good that these, while they were in force, were really good;—he who said so would be playing with the name 'good,' and would not touch the real question—it would be a mockery, would it not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">432</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly it would.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">433</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He ought not to speak of the name, but of the thing which is contemplated under the name.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">435</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Whatever be the term used, the good or expedient is the aim of legislation, and as far as she has an opinion, the state imposes all laws with a view to the greatest expediency; can legislation have any other aim?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">437</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But is the aim attained always?</div><div class="sentence"> do not mistakes often happen?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">438</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I think that there are mistakes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">439</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The possibility of error will be more distinctly recognised, if we put the question in reference to the whole class under which the good or expedient falls.</div><div class="sentence"> That whole class has to do with the future, and laws are passed under the idea that they will be useful in after-time; which, in other words, is the future.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">440</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">441</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Suppose now, that we ask Protagoras, or one of his disciples, a question: —O, Protagoras, we will say to him, Man is, as you declare, the measure of all things—white, heavy, light:  of all such things he is the judge; for he has the criterion of them in himself, and when he thinks that things are such as he experiences them to be, he thinks what is and is true to himself.</div><div class="sentence"> Is it not so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">442</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">443</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do you extend your doctrine, Protagoras (as we shall further say), to the future as well as to the present; and has he the criterion not only of what in his opinion is but of what will be, and do things always happen to him as he expected?</div><div class="sentence"> For example, take the case of heat: —When an ordinary man thinks that he is going to have a fever, and that this kind of heat is coming on, and another person, who is a physician, thinks the contrary, whose opinion is likely to prove right?</div><div class="sentence"> Or are they both right?—he will have a heat and fever in his own judgment, and not have a fever in the physician's judgment?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">444</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  How ludicrous!</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">445</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the vinegrower, if I am not mistaken, is a better judge of the sweetness or dryness of the vintage which is not yet gathered than the harp-player?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">447</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And in musical composition the musician will know better than the training master what the training master himself will hereafter think harmonious or the reverse?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">449</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the cook will be a better judge than the guest, who is not a cook, of the pleasure to be derived from the dinner which is in preparation; for of present or past pleasure we are not as yet arguing; but can we say that every one will be to himself the best judge of the pleasure which will seem to be and will be to him in the future?—nay, would not you, Protagoras, better guess which arguments in a court would convince any one of us than the ordinary man?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">450</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly, Socrates, he used to profess in the strongest manner that he was the superior of all men in this respect.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">451</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure, friend:  who would have paid a large sum for the privilege of talking to him, if he had really persuaded his visitors that neither a prophet nor any other man was better able to judge what will be and seem to be in the future than every one could for himself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">452</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Who indeed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">453</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And legislation and expediency are all concerned with the future; and every one will admit that states, in passing laws, must often fail of their highest interests?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">454</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">455</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then we may fairly argue against your master, that he must admit one man to be wiser than another, and that the wiser is a measure:  but I, who know nothing, am not at all obliged to accept the honour which the advocate of Protagoras was just now forcing upon me, whether I would or not, of being a measure of anything.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">456</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is the best refutation of him, Socrates; although he is also caught when he ascribes truth to the opinions of others, who give the lie direct to his own opinion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">457</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There are many ways, Theodorus, in which the doctrine that every opinion of every man is true may be refuted; but there is more difficulty in proving that states of feeling, which are present to a man, and out of which arise sensations and opinions in accordance with them, are also untrue.</div><div class="sentence"> And very likely I have been talking nonsense about them; for they may be unassailable, and those who say that there is clear evidence of them, and that they are matters of knowledge, may probably be right; in which case our friend Theaetetus was not so far from the mark when he identified perception and knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore let us draw nearer, as the advocate of Protagoras desires; and give the truth of the universal flux a ring:  is the theory sound or not?</div><div class="sentence"> at any rate, no small war is raging about it, and there are combination not a few.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">458</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  No small, war, indeed, for in Ionia the sect makes rapid strides; the disciples of Heracleitus are most energetic upholders of the doctrine.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">459</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then we are the more bound, my dear Theodorus, to examine the question from the foundation as it is set forth by themselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">460</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly we are.</div><div class="sentence"> About these speculations of Heracleitus, which, as you say, are as old as Homer, or even older still, the Ephesians themselves, who profess to know them, are downright mad, and you cannot talk with them on the subject.</div><div class="sentence"> For, in accordance with their text-books, they are always in motion; but as for dwelling upon an argument or a question, and quietly asking and answering in turn, they can no more do so than they can fly; or rather, the determination of these fellows not to have a particle of rest in them is more than the utmost powers of negation can express.</div><div class="sentence"> If you ask any of them a question, he will produce, as from a quiver, sayings brief and dark, and shoot them at you; and if you inquire the reason of what he has said, you will be hit by some other new-fangled word, and will make no way with any of them, nor they with one another; their great care is, not to allow of any settled principle either in their arguments or in their minds, conceiving, as I imagine, that any such principle would be stationary; for they are at war with the stationary, and do what they can to drive it out everywhere.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">461</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose, Theodorus, that you have only seen them when they were fighting, and have never stayed with them in time of peace, for they are no friends of yours; and their peace doctrines are only communicated by them at leisure, as I imagine, to those disciples of theirs whom they want to make like themselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">462</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Disciples!</div><div class="sentence"> my good sir, they have none; men of their sort are not one another's disciples, but they grow up at their own sweet will, and get their inspiration anywhere, each of them saying of his neighbour that he knows nothing.</div><div class="sentence"> From these men, then, as I was going to remark, you will never get a reason, whether with their will or without their will; we must take the question out of their hands, and make the analysis ourselves, as if we were doing geometrical problem.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">463</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Quite right too; but as touching the aforesaid problem, have we not heard from the ancients, who concealed their wisdom from the many in poetical figures, that Oceanus and Tethys, the origin of all things, are streams, and that nothing is at rest?</div><div class="sentence"> And now the moderns, in their superior wisdom, have declared the same openly, that the cobbler too may hear and learn of them, and no longer foolishly imagine that some things are at rest and others in motion—having learned that all is motion, he will duly honour his teachers.</div><div class="sentence"> I had almost forgotten the opposite doctrine, Theodorus,</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">464</span> <div class="sentence">  This is the language of Parmenides, Melissus, and their followers, who stoutly maintain that all being is one and self-contained, and has no place in which to move.</div><div class="sentence"> What shall we do, friend, with all these people; for, advancing step by step, we have imperceptibly got between the combatants, and, unless we can protect our retreat, we shall pay the penalty of our rashness—like the players in the palaestra who are caught upon the line, and are dragged different ways by the two parties.</div><div class="sentence"> Therefore I think that we had better begin by considering those whom we first accosted, 'the river-gods,' and, if we find any truth in them, we will help them to pull us over, and try to get away from the others.</div><div class="sentence"> But if the partisans of 'the whole' appear to speak more truly, we will fly off from the party which would move the immovable, to them.</div><div class="sentence"> And if I find that neither of them have anything reasonable to say, we shall be in a ridiculous position, having so great a conceit of our own poor opinion and rejecting that of ancient and famous men.</div><div class="sentence"> O Theodorus, do you think that there is any use in proceeding when the danger is so great?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">465</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Nay, Socrates, not to examine thoroughly what the two parties have to say would be quite intolerable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">466</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then examine we must, since you, who were so reluctant to begin, are so eager to proceed.</div><div class="sentence"> The nature of motion appears to be the question with which we begin.</div><div class="sentence"> What do they mean when they say that all things are in motion?</div><div class="sentence"> Is there only one kind of motion, or, as I rather incline to think, two?</div><div class="sentence"> I should like to have your opinion upon this point in addition to my own, that I may err, if I must err, in your company; tell me, then, when a thing changes from one place to another, or goes round in the same place, is not that what is called motion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">467</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">468</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Here then we have one kind of motion.</div><div class="sentence"> But when a thing, remaining on the same spot, grows old, or becomes black from being white, or hard from being soft, or undergoes any other change, may not this be properly called motion of another kind?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">469</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  I think so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">470</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Say rather that it must be so.</div><div class="sentence"> Of motion then there are these two kinds, 'change,' and 'motion in place.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">471</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  You are right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">472</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now, having made this distinction, let us address ourselves to those who say that all is motion, and ask them whether all things according to them have the two kinds of motion, and are changed as well as move in place, or is one thing moved in both ways, and another in one only?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">473</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Indeed, I do not know what to answer; but I think they would say that all things are moved in both ways.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">474</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, comrade; for, if not, they would have to say that the same things are in motion and at rest, and there would be no more truth in saying that all things are in motion, than that all things are at rest.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">475</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">476</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if they are to be in motion, and nothing is to be devoid of motion, all things must always have every sort of motion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">477</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">478</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Consider a further point:  did we not understand them to explain the generation of heat, whiteness, or anything else, in some such manner as the following: —were they not saying that each of them is moving between the agent and the patient, together with a perception, and that the patient ceases to be a perceiving power and becomes a percipient, and the agent a quale instead of a quality?</div><div class="sentence"> I suspect that quality may appear a strange and uncouth term to you, and that you do not understand the abstract expression.</div><div class="sentence"> Then I will take concrete instances:  I mean to say that the producing power or agent becomes neither heat nor whiteness but hot and white, and the like of other things.</div><div class="sentence"> For I must repeat what I said before, that neither the agent nor patient have any absolute existence, but when they come together and generate sensations and their objects, the one becomes a thing of a certain quality, and the other a percipient.</div><div class="sentence"> You remember?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">479</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">480</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We may leave the details of their theory unexamined, but we must not forget to ask them the only question with which we are concerned:  Are all things in motion and flux?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">481</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, they will reply.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">482</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And they are moved in both those ways which we distinguished, that is to say, they move in place and are also changed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">483</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course, if the motion is to be perfect.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">484</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  If they only moved in place and were not changed, we should be able to say what is the nature of the things which are in motion and flux?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">485</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">486</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But now, since not even white continues to flow white, and whiteness itself is a flux or change which is passing into another colour, and is never to be caught standing still, can the name of any colour be rightly used at all?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">487</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  How is that possible, Socrates, either in the case of this or of any other quality—if while we are using the word the object is escaping in the flux?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">488</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And what would you say of perceptions, such as sight and hearing, or any other kind of perception?</div><div class="sentence"> Is there any stopping in the act of seeing and hearing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">489</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not, if all things are in motion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">490</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then we must not speak of seeing any more than of not-seeing, nor of any other perception more than of any non-perception, if all things partake of every kind of motion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">491</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">492</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yet perception is knowledge:  so at least Theaetetus and I were saying.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">493</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">494</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then when we were asked what is knowledge, we no more answered what is knowledge than what is not knowledge?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">495</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">496</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Here, then, is a fine result:  we corrected our first answer in our eagerness to prove that nothing is at rest.</div><div class="sentence"> But if nothing is at rest, every answer upon whatever subject is equally right:  you may say that a thing is or is not thus; or, if you prefer, 'becomes' thus; and if we say 'becomes,' we shall not then hamper them with words expressive of rest.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">497</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">498</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Theodorus, except in saying 'thus' and 'not thus.'</div><div class="sentence"> But you ought not to use the word 'thus,' for there is no motion in 'thus' or in 'not thus.'</div><div class="sentence"> The maintainers of the doctrine have as yet no words in which to express themselves, and must get a new language.</div><div class="sentence"> I know of no word that will suit them, except perhaps 'no how,' which is perfectly indefinite.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">499</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, that is a manner of speaking in which they will be quite at home.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">500</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And so, Theodorus, we have got rid of your friend without assenting to his doctrine, that every man is the measure of all things—a wise man only is a measure; neither can we allow that knowledge is perception, certainly not on the hypothesis of a perpetual flux, unless perchance our friend Theaetetus is able to convince us that it is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">501</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good, Socrates; and now that the argument about the doctrine of Protagoras has been completed, I am absolved from answering; for this was the agreement.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">502</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Not, Theodorus, until you and Socrates have discussed the doctrine of those who say that all things are at rest, as you were proposing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">503</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  You, Theaetetus, who are a young rogue, must not instigate your elders to a breach of faith, but should prepare to answer Socrates in the remainder of the argument.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">504</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, if he wishes; but I would rather have heard about the doctrine of rest.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">505</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Invite Socrates to an argument—invite horsemen to the open plain; do but ask him, and he will answer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">506</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Nevertheless, Theodorus, I am afraid that I shall not be able to comply with the request of Theaetetus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">507</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  Not comply!</div><div class="sentence"> for what reason?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">508</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  My reason is that I have a kind of reverence; not so much for Melissus and the others, who say that 'All is one and at rest,' as for the great leader himself, Parmenides, venerable and awful, as in Homeric language he may be called;—him I should be ashamed to approach in a spirit unworthy of him.</div><div class="sentence"> I met him when he was an old man, and I was a mere youth, and he appeared to me to have a glorious depth of mind.</div><div class="sentence"> And I am afraid that we may not understand his words, and may be still further from understanding his meaning; above all I fear that the nature of knowledge, which is the main subject of our discussion, may be thrust out of sight by the unbidden guests who will come pouring in upon our feast of discourse, if we let them in—besides, the question which is now stirring is of immense extent, and will be treated unfairly if only considered by the way; or if treated adequately and at length, will put into the shade the other question of knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither the one nor the other can be allowed; but I must try by my art of midwifery to deliver Theaetetus of his conceptions about knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">509</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very well; do so if you will.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">510</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then now, Theaetetus, take another view of the subject:  you answered that knowledge is perception?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">511</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I did.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">512</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if any one were to ask you:  With what does a man see black and white colours?</div><div class="sentence"> and with what does he hear high and low sounds?—you would say, if I am not mistaken, 'With the eyes and with the ears.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">513</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">514</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The free use of words and phrases, rather than minute precision, is generally characteristic of a liberal education, and the opposite is pedantic; but sometimes precision is necessary, and I believe that the answer which you have just given is open to the charge of incorrectness; for which is more correct, to say that we see or hear with the eyes and with the ears, or through the eyes and through the ears.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">515</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should say 'through,' Socrates, rather than 'with.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">516</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, my boy, for no one can suppose that in each of us, as in a sort of Trojan horse, there are perched a number of unconnected senses, which do not all meet in some one nature, the mind, or whatever we please to call it, of which they are the instruments, and with which through them we perceive objects of sense.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">517</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I agree with you in that opinion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">518</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The reason why I am thus precise is, because I want to know whether, when we perceive black and white through the eyes, and again, other qualities through other organs, we do not perceive them with one and the same part of ourselves, and, if you were asked, you might refer all such perceptions to the body.</div><div class="sentence"> Perhaps, however, I had better allow you to answer for yourself and not interfere.</div><div class="sentence"> Tell me, then, are not the organs through which you perceive warm and hard and light and sweet, organs of the body?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">519</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of the body, certainly.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">521</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">522</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  If you have any thought about both of them, this common perception cannot come to you, either through the one or the other organ?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">524</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How about sounds and colours:  in the first place you would admit that they both exist?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">532</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But through what do you perceive all this about them?</div><div class="sentence"> for neither through hearing nor yet through seeing can you apprehend that which they have in common.</div><div class="sentence"> Let me give you an illustration of the point at issue: —If there were any meaning in asking whether sounds and colours are saline or not, you would be able to tell me what faculty would consider the question.</div><div class="sentence"> It would not be sight or hearing, but some other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">533</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly; the faculty of taste.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">534</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good; and now tell me what is the power which discerns, not only in sensible objects, but in all things, universal notions, such as those which are called being and not-being, and those others about which we were just asking—what organs will you assign for the perception of these notions?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">535</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  You are thinking of being and not being, likeness and unlikeness, sameness and difference, and also of unity and other numbers which are applied to objects of sense; and you mean to ask, through what bodily organ the soul perceives odd and even numbers and other arithmetical conceptions.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">536</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You follow me excellently, Theaetetus; that is precisely what I am asking.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">537</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Indeed, Socrates, I cannot answer; my only notion is, that these, unlike objects of sense, have no separate organ, but that the mind, by a power of her own, contemplates the universals in all things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">538</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You are a beauty, Theaetetus, and not ugly, as Theodorus was saying; for he who utters the beautiful is himself beautiful and good.</div><div class="sentence"> And besides being beautiful, you have done me a kindness in releasing me from a very long discussion, if you are clear that the soul views some things by herself and others through the bodily organs.</div><div class="sentence"> For that was my own opinion, and I wanted you to agree with me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">539</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I am quite clear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">540</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And to which class would you refer being or essence; for this, of all our notions, is the most universal?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">541</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should say, to that class which the soul aspires to know of herself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">542</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And would you say this also of like and unlike, same and other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">543</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">544</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And would you say the same of the noble and base, and of good and evil?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">545</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  These I conceive to be notions which are essentially relative, and which the soul also perceives by comparing in herself things past and present with the future.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">546</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And does she not perceive the hardness of that which is hard by the touch, and the softness of that which is soft equally by the touch?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">547</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">548</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But their essence and what they are, and their opposition to one another, and the essential nature of this opposition, the soul herself endeavours to decide for us by the review and comparison of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">549</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">550</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The simple sensations which reach the soul through the body are given at birth to men and animals by nature, but their reflections on the being and use of them are slowly and hardly gained, if they are ever gained, by education and long experience.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">551</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Assuredly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">552</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And can a man attain truth who fails of attaining being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">553</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">554</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And can he who misses the truth of anything, have a knowledge of that thing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">555</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  He cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">556</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then knowledge does not consist in impressions of sense, but in reasoning about them; in that only, and not in the mere impression, truth and being can be attained?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">557</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">558</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And would you call the two processes by the same name, when there is so great a difference between them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">559</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  That would certainly not be right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">560</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And what name would you give to seeing, hearing, smelling, being cold and being hot?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">561</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should call all of them perceiving—what other name could be given to them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">562</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Perception would be the collective name of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">563</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">564</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Which, as we say, has no part in the attainment of truth any more than of being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">565</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">566</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And therefore not in science or knowledge?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">567</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">568</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then perception, Theaetetus, can never be the same as knowledge or science?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">569</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly not, Socrates; and knowledge has now been most distinctly proved to be different from perception.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">570</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But the original aim of our discussion was to find out rather what knowledge is than what it is not; at the same time we have made some progress, for we no longer seek for knowledge in perception at all, but in that other process, however called, in which the mind is alone and engaged with being.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">571</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  You mean, Socrates, if I am not mistaken, what is called thinking or opining.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">572</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You conceive truly.</div><div class="sentence"> And now, my friend, please to begin again at this point; and having wiped out of your memory all that has preceded, see if you have arrived at any clearer view, and once more say what is knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">573</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I cannot say, Socrates, that all opinion is knowledge, because there may be a false opinion; but I will venture to assert, that knowledge is true opinion:  let this then be my reply; and if this is hereafter disproved, I must try to find another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">574</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That is the way in which you ought to answer, Theaetetus, and not in your former hesitating strain, for if we are bold we shall gain one of two advantages; either we shall find what we seek, or we shall be less likely to think that we know what we do not know—in either case we shall be richly rewarded.</div><div class="sentence"> And now, what are you saying?—Are there two sorts of opinion, one true and the other false; and do you define knowledge to be the true?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">575</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, according to my present view.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">576</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Is it still worth our while to resume the discussion touching opinion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">577</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  To what are you alluding?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">578</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There is a point which often troubles me, and is a great perplexity to me, both in regard to myself and others.</div><div class="sentence"> I cannot make out the nature or origin of the mental experience to which I refer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">579</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Pray what is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">580</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How there can be false opinion—that difficulty still troubles the eye of my mind; and I am uncertain whether I shall leave the question, or begin over again in a new way.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">581</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Begin again, Socrates,—at least if you think that there is the slightest necessity for doing so.</div><div class="sentence"> Were not you and Theodorus just now remarking very truly, that in discussions of this kind we may take our own time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">582</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You are quite right, and perhaps there will be no harm in retracing our steps and beginning again.</div><div class="sentence"> Better a little which is well done, than a great deal imperfectly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">583</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">584</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, and what is the difficulty?</div><div class="sentence"> Do we not speak of false opinion, and say that one man holds a false and another a true opinion, as though there were some natural distinction between them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">585</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  We certainly say so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">586</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  All things and everything are either known or not known.</div><div class="sentence"> I leave out of view the intermediate conceptions of learning and forgetting, because they have nothing to do with our present question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">587</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  There can be no doubt, Socrates, if you exclude these, that there is no other alternative but knowing or not knowing a thing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">588</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That point being now determined, must we not say that he who has an opinion, must have an opinion about something which he knows or does not know?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">589</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  He must.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">590</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He who knows, cannot but know; and he who does not know, cannot know?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">591</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">592</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What shall we say then?</div><div class="sentence"> When a man has a false opinion does he think that which he knows to be some other thing which he knows, and knowing both, is he at the same time ignorant of both?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">593</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  That, Socrates, is impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">594</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But perhaps he thinks of something which he does not know as some other thing which he does not know; for example, he knows neither Theaetetus nor Socrates, and yet he fancies that Theaetetus is Socrates, or Socrates Theaetetus?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">595</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  How can he?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">596</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But surely he cannot suppose what he knows to be what he does not know, or what he does not know to be what he knows?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">597</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  That would be monstrous.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">598</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Where, then, is false opinion?</div><div class="sentence"> For if all things are either known or unknown, there can be no opinion which is not comprehended under this alternative, and so false opinion is excluded.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">599</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">600</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Suppose that we remove the question out of the sphere of knowing or not knowing, into that of being and not-being.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">601</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">602</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  May we not suspect the simple truth to be that he who thinks about anything, that which is not, will necessarily think what is false, whatever in other respects may be the state of his mind?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">603</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  That, again, is not unlikely, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">604</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then suppose some one to say to us, Theaetetus: —Is it possible for any man to think that which is not, either as a self-existent substance or as a predicate of something else?</div><div class="sentence"> And suppose that we answer, 'Yes, he can, when he thinks what is not true.</div><div class="sentence"> '—That will be our answer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">605</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">606</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But is there any parallel to this?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">607</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">608</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Can a man see something and yet see nothing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">609</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">610</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if he sees any one thing, he sees something that exists.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you suppose that what is one is ever to be found among non-existing things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">611</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I do not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">612</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He then who sees some one thing, sees something which is?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">613</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">614</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And he who hears anything, hears some one thing, and hears that which is?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">615</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">616</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And he who touches anything, touches something which is one and therefore is?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">617</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  That again is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">618</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And does not he who thinks, think some one thing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">619</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">620</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And does not he who thinks some one thing, think something which is?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">621</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">622</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then he who thinks of that which is not, thinks of nothing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">623</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">624</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And he who thinks of nothing, does not think at all?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">625</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Obviously.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">626</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then no one can think that which is not, either as a self-existent substance or as a predicate of something else?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">627</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">628</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then to think falsely is different from thinking that which is not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">629</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  It would seem so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">630</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then false opinion has no existence in us, either in the sphere of being or of knowledge?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">631</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">632</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But may not the following be the description of what we express by this name?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">633</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">634</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  May we not suppose that false opinion or thought is a sort of heterodoxy; a person may make an exchange in his mind, and say that one real object is another real object.</div><div class="sentence"> For thus he always thinks that which is, but he puts one thing in place of another; and missing the aim of his thoughts, he may be truly said to have false opinion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">635</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Now you appear to me to have spoken the exact truth:  when a man puts the base in the place of the noble, or the noble in the place of the base, then he has truly false opinion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">636</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I see, Theaetetus, that your fear has disappeared, and that you are beginning to despise me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">637</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  What makes you say so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">638</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You think, if I am not mistaken, that your 'truly false' is safe from censure, and that I shall never ask whether there can be a swift which is slow, or a heavy which is light, or any other self-contradictory thing, which works, not according to its own nature, but according to that of its opposite.</div><div class="sentence"> But I will not insist upon this, for I do not wish needlessly to discourage you.</div><div class="sentence"> And so you are satisfied that false opinion is heterodoxy, or the thought of something else?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">639</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I am.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">640</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  It is possible then upon your view for the mind to conceive of one thing as another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">641</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">642</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But must not the mind, or thinking power, which misplaces them, have a conception either of both objects or of one of them?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">644</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Either together or in succession?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">645</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">646</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do you mean by conceiving, the same which I mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">647</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">648</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I mean the conversation which the soul holds with herself in considering of anything.</div><div class="sentence"> I speak of what I scarcely understand; but the soul when thinking appears to me to be just talking—asking questions of herself and answering them, affirming and denying.</div><div class="sentence"> And when she has arrived at a decision, either gradually or by a sudden impulse, and has at last agreed, and does not doubt, this is called her opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> I say, then, that to form an opinion is to speak, and opinion is a word spoken,—I mean, to oneself and in silence, not aloud or to another:  What think you?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">700</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In the third case, not knowing and not perceiving either of you, I cannot think that one of you whom I do not know is the other whom I do not know.</div><div class="sentence"> I need not again go over the catalogue of excluded cases, in which I cannot form a false opinion about you and Theodorus, either when I know both or when I am in ignorance of both, or when I know one and not the other.</div><div class="sentence"> And the same of perceiving:  do you understand me?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">701</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">702</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The only possibility of erroneous opinion is, when knowing you and Theodorus, and having on the waxen block the impression of both of you given as by a seal, but seeing you imperfectly and at a distance, I try to assign the right impression of memory to the right visual impression, and to fit this into its own print:  if I succeed, recognition will take place; but if I fail and transpose them, putting the foot into the wrong shoe—that is to say, putting the vision of either of you on to the wrong impression, or if my mind, like the sight in a mirror, which is transferred from right to left, err by reason of some similar affection, then 'heterodoxy' and false opinion ensues.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">703</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates, you have described the nature of opinion with wonderful exactness.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">706</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I meant to say, that when a person knows and perceives one of you, his knowledge coincides with his perception, he will never think him to be some other person, whom he knows and perceives, and the knowledge of whom coincides with his perception—for that also was a case supposed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">707</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">708</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But there was an omission of the further case, in which, as we now say, false opinion may arise, when knowing both, and seeing, or having some other sensible perception of both, I fail in holding the seal over against the corresponding sensation; like a bad archer, I miss and fall wide of the mark—and this is called falsehood.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">709</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; it is rightly so called.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">710</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  When, therefore, perception is present to one of the seals or impressions but not to the other, and the mind fits the seal of the absent perception on the one which is present, in any case of this sort the mind is deceived; in a word, if our view is sound, there can be no error or deception about things which a man does not know and has never perceived, but only in things which are known and perceived; in these alone opinion turns and twists about, and becomes alternately true and false;—true when the seals and impressions of sense meet straight and opposite—false when they go awry and crooked.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">711</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  And is not that, Socrates, nobly said?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">712</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Nobly!</div><div class="sentence"> yes; but wait a little and hear the explanation, and then you will say so with more reason; for to think truly is noble and to be deceived is base.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">713</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Undoubtedly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">714</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the origin of truth and error is as follows: —When the wax in the soul of any one is deep and abundant, and smooth and perfectly tempered, then the impressions which pass through the senses and sink into the heart of the soul, as Homer says in a parable, meaning to indicate the likeness of the soul to wax (Kerh Kerhos); these, I say, being pure and clear, and having a sufficient depth of wax, are also lasting, and minds, such as these, easily learn and easily retain, and are not liable to confusion, but have true thoughts, for they have plenty of room, and having clear impressions of things, as we term them, quickly distribute them into their proper places on the block.</div><div class="sentence"> And such men are called wise.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you agree?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">715</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Entirely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">716</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But when the heart of any one is shaggy—a quality which the all-wise poet commends, or muddy and of impure wax, or very soft, or very hard, then there is a corresponding defect in the mind—the soft are good at learning, but apt to forget; and the hard are the reverse; the shaggy and rugged and gritty, or those who have an admixture of earth or dung in their composition, have the impressions indistinct, as also the hard, for there is no depth in them; and the soft too are indistinct, for their impressions are easily confused and effaced.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet greater is the indistinctness when they are all jostled together in a little soul, which has no room.</div><div class="sentence"> These are the natures which have false opinion; for when they see or hear or think of anything, they are slow in assigning the right objects to the right impressions—in their stupidity they confuse them, and are apt to see and hear and think amiss—and such men are said to be deceived in their knowledge of objects, and ignorant.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">717</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  No man, Socrates, can say anything truer than that.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">718</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then now we may admit the existence of false opinion in us?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">719</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">720</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And of true opinion also?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">725</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  What makes you say so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">726</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Because I am disheartened at my own stupidity and tiresome garrulity; for what other term will describe the habit of a man who is always arguing on all sides of a question; whose dulness cannot be convinced, and who will never leave off?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">727</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  But what puts you out of heart?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">728</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I am not only out of heart, but in positive despair; for I do not know what to answer if any one were to ask me: —O Socrates, have you indeed discovered that false opinion arises neither in the comparison of perceptions with one another nor yet in thought, but in union of thought and perception?</div><div class="sentence"> Yes, I shall say, with the complacence of one who thinks that he has made a noble discovery.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">729</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I see no reason why we should be ashamed of our demonstration, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">730</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He will say:  You mean to argue that the man whom we only think of and do not see, cannot be confused with the horse which we do not see or touch, but only think of and do not perceive?</div><div class="sentence"> That I believe to be my meaning, I shall reply.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">731</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">732</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, he will say, according to that argument, the number eleven, which is only thought, can never be mistaken for twelve, which is only thought:  How would you answer him?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">733</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should say that a mistake may very likely arise between the eleven or twelve which are seen or handled, but that no similar mistake can arise between the eleven and twelve which are in the mind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">734</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but do you think that no one ever put before his own mind five and seven,—I do not mean five or seven men or horses, but five or seven in the abstract, which, as we say, are recorded on the waxen block, and in which false opinion is held to be impossible; did no man ever ask himself how many these numbers make when added together, and answer that they are eleven, while another thinks that they are twelve, or would all agree in thinking and saying that they are twelve?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">735</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not; many would think that they are eleven, and in the higher numbers the chance of error is greater still; for I assume you to be speaking of numbers in general.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">736</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly; and I want you to consider whether this does not imply that the twelve in the waxen block are supposed to be eleven?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">737</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, that seems to be the case.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">738</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then do we not come back to the old difficulty?</div><div class="sentence"> For he who makes such a mistake does think one thing which he knows to be another thing which he knows; but this, as we said, was impossible, and afforded an irresistible proof of the non-existence of false opinion, because otherwise the same person would inevitably know and not know the same thing at the same time.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">739</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">740</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then false opinion cannot be explained as a confusion of thought and sense, for in that case we could not have been mistaken about pure conceptions of thought; and thus we are obliged to say, either that false opinion does not exist, or that a man may not know that which he knows;—which alternative do you prefer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">741</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  It is hard to determine, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">742</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet the argument will scarcely admit of both.</div><div class="sentence"> But, as we are at our wits' end, suppose that we do a shameless thing?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">744</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us attempt to explain the verb 'to know.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">745</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  And why should that be shameless?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">746</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You seem not to be aware that the whole of our discussion from the very beginning has been a search after knowledge, of which we are assumed not to know the nature.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">747</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Nay, but I am well aware.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">748</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is it not shameless when we do not know what knowledge is, to be explaining the verb 'to know'?</div><div class="sentence"> The truth is, Theaetetus, that we have long been infected with logical impurity.</div><div class="sentence"> Thousands of times have we repeated the words 'we know,' and 'do not know,' and 'we have or have not science or knowledge,' as if we could understand what we are saying to one another, so long as we remain ignorant about knowledge; and at this moment we are using the words 'we understand,' 'we are ignorant,' as though we could still employ them when deprived of knowledge or science.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">760</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I should distinguish 'having' from 'possessing':  for example, a man may buy and keep under his control a garment which he does not wear; and then we should say, not that he has, but that he possesses the garment.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">761</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  It would be the correct expression.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">779</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">780</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And he can reckon abstract numbers in his head, or things about him which are numerable?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">781</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course he can.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">782</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And to reckon is simply to consider how much such and such a number amounts to?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">783</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">784</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And so he appears to be searching into something which he knows, as if he did not know it, for we have already admitted that he knows all numbers;—you have heard these perplexing questions raised?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">785</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I have.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">787</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">788</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That was my reason for asking how we ought to speak when an arithmetician sets about numbering, or a grammarian about reading?</div><div class="sentence"> Shall we say, that although he knows, he comes back to himself to learn what he already knows?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">789</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  It would be too absurd, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">790</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Shall we say then that he is going to read or number what he does not know, although we have admitted that he knows all letters and all numbers?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">791</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  That, again, would be an absurdity.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">792</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then shall we say that about names we care nothing?—any one may twist and turn the words 'knowing' and 'learning' in any way which he likes, but since we have determined that the possession of knowledge is not the having or using it, we do assert that a man cannot not possess that which he possesses; and, therefore, in no case can a man not know that which he knows, but he may get a false opinion about it; for he may have the knowledge, not of this particular thing, but of some other;—when the various numbers and forms of knowledge are flying about in the aviary, and wishing to capture a certain sort of knowledge out of the general store, he takes the wrong one by mistake, that is to say, when he thought eleven to be twelve, he got hold of the ring-dove which he had in his mind, when he wanted the pigeon.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">793</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  A very rational explanation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">794</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But when he catches the one which he wants, then he is not deceived, and has an opinion of what is, and thus false and true opinion may exist, and the difficulties which were previously raised disappear.</div><div class="sentence"> I dare say that you agree with me, do you not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">795</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">796</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And so we are rid of the difficulty of a man's not knowing what he knows, for we are not driven to the inference that he does not possess what he possesses, whether he be or be not deceived.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet I fear that a greater difficulty is looking in at the window.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">797</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">798</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How can the exchange of one knowledge for another ever become false opinion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">799</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">800</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In the first place, how can a man who has the knowledge of anything be ignorant of that which he knows, not by reason of ignorance, but by reason of his own knowledge?</div><div class="sentence"> And, again, is it not an extreme absurdity that he should suppose another thing to be this, and this to be another thing;—that, having knowledge present with him in his mind, he should still know nothing and be ignorant of all things?—you might as well argue that ignorance may make a man know, and blindness make him see, as that knowledge can make him ignorant.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">801</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Perhaps, Socrates, we may have been wrong in making only forms of knowledge our birds:  whereas there ought to have been forms of ignorance as well, flying about together in the mind, and then he who sought to take one of them might sometimes catch a form of knowledge, and sometimes a form of ignorance; and thus he would have a false opinion from ignorance, but a true one from knowledge, about the same thing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">802</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I cannot help praising you, Theaetetus, and yet I must beg you to reconsider your words.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us grant what you say—then, according to you, he who takes ignorance will have a false opinion—am I right?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">804</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He will certainly not think that he has a false opinion?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">806</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He will think that his opinion is true, and he will fancy that he knows the things about which he has been deceived?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">808</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then he will think that he has captured knowledge and not ignorance?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">809</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">810</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And thus, after going a long way round, we are once more face to face with our original difficulty.</div><div class="sentence"> The hero of dialectic will retort upon us: —'O my excellent friends, he will say, laughing, if a man knows the form of ignorance and the form of knowledge, can he think that one of them which he knows is the other which he knows?</div><div class="sentence"> or, if he knows neither of them, can he think that the one which he knows not is another which he knows not?</div><div class="sentence"> or, if he knows one and not the other, can he think the one which he knows to be the one which he does not know?</div><div class="sentence"> or the one which he does not know to be the one which he knows?</div><div class="sentence"> or will you tell me that there are other forms of knowledge which distinguish the right and wrong birds, and which the owner keeps in some other aviaries or graven on waxen blocks according to your foolish images, and which he may be said to know while he possesses them, even though he have them not at hand in his mind?</div><div class="sentence"> And thus, in a perpetual circle, you will be compelled to go round and round, and you will make no progress.'</div><div class="sentence"> What are we to say in reply, Theaetetus?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">811</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Indeed, Socrates, I do not know what we are to say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">812</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Are not his reproaches just, and does not the argument truly show that we are wrong in seeking for false opinion until we know what knowledge is; that must be first ascertained; then, the nature of false opinion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">813</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I cannot but agree with you, Socrates, so far as we have yet gone.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">814</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, once more, what shall we say that knowledge is?—for we are not going to lose heart as yet.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">815</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly, I shall not lose heart, if you do not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">816</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What definition will be most consistent with our former views?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">817</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I cannot think of any but our old one, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">818</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What was it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">819</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Knowledge was said by us to be true opinion; and true opinion is surely unerring, and the results which follow from it are all noble and good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">820</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He who led the way into the river, Theaetetus, said 'The experiment will show;' and perhaps if we go forward in the search, we may stumble upon the thing which we are looking for; but if we stay where we are, nothing will come to light.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">821</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true; let us go forward and try.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">822</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The trail soon comes to an end, for a whole profession is against us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">823</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  How is that, and what profession do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">824</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The profession of the great wise ones who are called orators and lawyers; for these persuade men by their art and make them think whatever they like, but they do not teach them.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you imagine that there are any teachers in the world so clever as to be able to convince others of the truth about acts of robbery or violence, of which they were not eye-witnesses, while a little water is flowing in the clepsydra?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">825</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not, they can only persuade them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">826</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And would you not say that persuading them is making them have an opinion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">827</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">828</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  When, therefore, judges are justly persuaded about matters which you can know only by seeing them, and not in any other way, and when thus judging of them from report they attain a true opinion about them, they judge without knowledge, and yet are rightly persuaded, if they have judged well.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">829</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">830</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet, O my friend, if true opinion in law courts and knowledge are the same, the perfect judge could not have judged rightly without knowledge; and therefore I must infer that they are not the same.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">831</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is a distinction, Socrates, which I have heard made by some one else, but I had forgotten it.</div><div class="sentence"> He said that true opinion, combined with reason, was knowledge, but that the opinion which had no reason was out of the sphere of knowledge; and that things of which there is no rational account are not knowable—such was the singular expression which he used—and that things which have a reason or explanation are knowable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">832</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Excellent; but then, how did he distinguish between things which are and are not 'knowable'?</div><div class="sentence"> I wish that you would repeat to me what he said, and then I shall know whether you and I have heard the same tale.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">833</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I do not know whether I can recall it; but if another person would tell me, I think that I could follow him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">834</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let me give you, then, a dream in return for a dream: —Methought that I too had a dream, and I heard in my dream that the primeval letters or elements out of which you and I and all other things are compounded, have no reason or explanation; you can only name them, but no predicate can be either affirmed or denied of them, for in the one case existence, in the other non-existence is already implied, neither of which must be added, if you mean to speak of this or that thing by itself alone.</div><div class="sentence"> It should not be called itself, or that, or each, or alone, or this, or the like; for these go about everywhere and are applied to all things, but are distinct from them; whereas, if the first elements could be described, and had a definition of their own, they would be spoken of apart from all else.</div><div class="sentence"> But none of these primeval elements can be defined; they can only be named, for they have nothing but a name, and the things which are compounded of them, as they are complex, are expressed by a combination of names, for the combination of names is the essence of a definition.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus, then, the elements or letters are only objects of perception, and cannot be defined or known; but the syllables or combinations of them are known and expressed, and are apprehended by true opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> When, therefore, any one forms the true opinion of anything without rational explanation, you may say that his mind is truly exercised, but has no knowledge; for he who cannot give and receive a reason for a thing, has no knowledge of that thing; but when he adds rational explanation, then, he is perfected in knowledge and may be all that I have been denying of him.</div><div class="sentence"> Was that the form in which the dream appeared to you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">835</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Precisely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">836</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And you allow and maintain that true opinion, combined with definition or rational explanation, is knowledge?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">837</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">838</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then may we assume, Theaetetus, that to-day, and in this casual manner, we have found a truth which in former times many wise men have grown old and have not found?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">839</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  At any rate, Socrates, I am satisfied with the present statement.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">840</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Which is probably correct—for how can there be knowledge apart from definition and true opinion?</div><div class="sentence"> And yet there is one point in what has been said which does not quite satisfy me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">841</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  What was it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">842</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What might seem to be the most ingenious notion of all: —That the elements or letters are unknown, but the combination or syllables known.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">843</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  And was that wrong?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">844</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We shall soon know; for we have as hostages the instances which the author of the argument himself used.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">846</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The letters, which are the clements; and the syllables, which are the combinations;—he reasoned, did he not, from the letters of the alphabet?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">847</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; he did.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">848</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us take them and put them to the test, or rather, test ourselves: —What was the way in which we learned letters?</div><div class="sentence"> and, first of all, are we right in saying that syllables have a definition, but that letters have no definition?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">849</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I think so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">850</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I think so too; for, suppose that some one asks you to spell the first syllable of my name: —Theaetetus, he says, what is SO?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">851</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should reply S and O.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">852</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That is the definition which you would give of the syllable?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">853</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">855</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  But how can any one, Socrates, tell the elements of an element?</div><div class="sentence"> I can only reply, that S is a consonant, a mere noise, as of the tongue hissing; B, and most other letters, again, are neither vowel-sounds nor noises.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus letters may be most truly said to be undefined; for even the most distinct of them, which are the seven vowels, have a sound only, but no definition at all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">856</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, I suppose, my friend, that we have been so far right in our idea about knowledge?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">857</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; I think that we have.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">858</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but have we been right in maintaining that the syllables can be known, but not the letters?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">859</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I think so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">860</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do we mean by a syllable two letters, or if there are more, all of them, or a single idea which arises out of the combination of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">861</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should say that we mean all the letters.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">864</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He knows, that is, the S and O?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">865</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">866</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But can he be ignorant of either singly and yet know both together?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">867</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Such a supposition, Socrates, is monstrous and unmeaning.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">868</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if he cannot know both without knowing each, then if he is ever to know the syllable, he must know the letters first; and thus the fine theory has again taken wings and departed.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">870</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, we did not keep watch properly.</div><div class="sentence"> Perhaps we ought to have maintained that a syllable is not the letters, but rather one single idea framed out of them, having a separate form distinct from them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">871</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true; and a more likely notion than the other.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">874</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us assume then, as we now say, that the syllable is a simple form arising out of the several combinations of harmonious elements—of letters or of any other elements.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">910</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then the whole is not made up of parts, for it would be the all, if consisting of all the parts?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">911</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is the inference.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">924</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if letters are not parts of syllables, can you tell me of any other parts of syllables, which are not letters?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">925</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  No, indeed, Socrates; for if I admit the existence of parts in a syllable, it would be ridiculous in me to give up letters and seek for other parts.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">926</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true, Theaetetus, and therefore, according to our present view, a syllable must surely be some indivisible form?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">927</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">928</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But do you remember, my friend, that only a little while ago we admitted and approved the statement, that of the first elements out of which all other things are compounded there could be no definition, because each of them when taken by itself is uncompounded; nor can one rightly attribute to them the words 'being' or 'this,' because they are alien and inappropriate words, and for this reason the letters or elements were indefinable and unknown?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">929</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I remember.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">930</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is not this also the reason why they are simple and indivisible?</div><div class="sentence"> I can see no other.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">932</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then is not the syllable in the same case as the elements or letters, if it has no parts and is one form?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">933</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">934</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  If, then, a syllable is a whole, and has many parts or letters, the letters as well as the syllable must be intelligible and expressible, since all the parts are acknowledged to be the same as the whole?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">936</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if it be one and indivisible, then the syllables and the letters are alike undefined and unknown, and for the same reason?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">937</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I cannot deny that.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">938</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We cannot, therefore, agree in the opinion of him who says that the syllable can be known and expressed, but not the letters.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">939</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not; if we may trust the argument.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">940</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but will you not be equally inclined to disagree with him, when you remember your own experience in learning to read?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">941</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  What experience?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">942</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, that in learning you were kept trying to distinguish the separate letters both by the eye and by the ear, in order that, when you heard them spoken or saw them written, you might not be confused by their position.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">943</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">944</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is the education of the harp-player complete unless he can tell what string answers to a particular note; the notes, as every one would allow, are the elements or letters of music?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">945</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">946</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, if we argue from the letters and syllables which we know to other simples and compounds, we shall say that the letters or simple elements as a class are much more certainly known than the syllables, and much more indispensable to a perfect knowledge of any subject; and if some one says that the syllable is known and the letter unknown, we shall consider that either intentionally or unintentionally he is talking nonsense?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">947</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">948</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And there might be given other proofs of this belief, if I am not mistaken.</div><div class="sentence"> But do not let us in looking for them lose sight of the question before us, which is the meaning of the statement, that right opinion with rational definition or explanation is the most perfect form of knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">949</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  We must not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">950</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, and what is the meaning of the term 'explanation'?</div><div class="sentence"> I think that we have a choice of three meanings.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">951</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  What are they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">952</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In the first place, the meaning may be, manifesting one's thought by the voice with verbs and nouns, imaging an opinion in the stream which flows from the lips, as in a mirror or water.</div><div class="sentence"> Does not explanation appear to be of this nature?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">953</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly; he who so manifests his thought, is said to explain himself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">954</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And every one who is not born deaf or dumb is able sooner or later to manifest what he thinks of anything; and if so, all those who have a right opinion about anything will also have right explanation; nor will right opinion be anywhere found to exist apart from knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">955</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">956</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us not, therefore, hastily charge him who gave this account of knowledge with uttering an unmeaning word; for perhaps he only intended to say, that when a person was asked what was the nature of anything, he should be able to answer his questioner by giving the elements of the thing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">957</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  As for example, Socrates...?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">958</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  As, for example, when Hesiod says that a waggon is made up of a hundred planks.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, neither you nor I could describe all of them individually; but if any one asked what is a waggon, we should be content to answer, that a waggon consists of wheels, axle, body, rims, yoke.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">959</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">960</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And our opponent will probably laugh at us, just as he would if we professed to be grammarians and to give a grammatical account of the name of Theaetetus, and yet could only tell the syllables and not the letters of your name—that would be true opinion, and not knowledge; for knowledge, as has been already remarked, is not attained until, combined with true opinion, there is an enumeration of the elements out of which anything is composed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">961</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">962</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In the same general way, we might also have true opinion about a waggon; but he who can describe its essence by an enumeration of the hundred planks, adds rational explanation to true opinion, and instead of opinion has art and knowledge of the nature of a waggon, in that he attains to the whole through the elements.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">963</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  And do you not agree in that view, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">964</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  If you do, my friend; but I want to know first, whether you admit the resolution of all things into their elements to be a rational explanation of them, and the consideration of them in syllables or larger combinations of them to be irrational—is this your view?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">965</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Precisely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">966</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, and do you conceive that a man has knowledge of any element who at one time affirms and at another time denies that element of something, or thinks that the same thing is composed of different elements at different times?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">967</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Assuredly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">968</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do you not remember that in your case and in that of others this often occurred in the process of learning to read?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">969</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  You mean that I mistook the letters and misspelt the syllables?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">970</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">971</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure; I perfectly remember, and I am very far from supposing that they who are in this condition have knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">972</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  When a person at the time of learning writes the name of Theaetetus, and thinks that he ought to write and does write Th and e; but, again, meaning to write the name of Theododorus, thinks that he ought to write and does write T and e—can we suppose that he knows the first syllables of your two names?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">973</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  We have already admitted that such a one has not yet attained knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">974</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And in like manner be may enumerate without knowing them the second and third and fourth syllables of your name?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">975</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  He may.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">976</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And in that case, when he knows the order of the letters and can write them out correctly, he has right opinion?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">978</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But although we admit that he has right opinion, he will still be without knowledge?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">980</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet he will have explanation, as well as right opinion, for he knew the order of the letters when he wrote; and this we admit to be explanation.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">982</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, my friend, there is such a thing as right opinion united with definition or explanation, which does not as yet attain to the exactness of knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">983</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  It would seem so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">984</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And what we fancied to be a perfect definition of knowledge is a dream only.</div><div class="sentence"> But perhaps we had better not say so as yet, for were there not three explanations of knowledge, one of which must, as we said, be adopted by him who maintains knowledge to be true opinion combined with rational explanation?</div><div class="sentence"> And very likely there may be found some one who will not prefer this but the third.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">985</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  You are quite right; there is still one remaining.</div><div class="sentence"> The first was the image or expression of the mind in speech; the second, which has just been mentioned, is a way of reaching the whole by an enumeration of the elements.</div><div class="sentence"> But what is the third definition?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">986</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There is, further, the popular notion of telling the mark or sign of difference which distinguishes the thing in question from all others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">987</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Can you give me any example of such a definition?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">988</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  As, for example, in the case of the sun, I think that you would be contented with the statement that the sun is the brightest of the heavenly bodies which revolve about the earth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">989</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">990</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Understand why: —the reason is, as I was just now saying, that if you get at the difference and distinguishing characteristic of each thing, then, as many persons affirm, you will get at the definition or explanation of it; but while you lay hold only of the common and not of the characteristic notion, you will only have the definition of those things to which this common quality belongs.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">991</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I understand you, and your account of definition is in my judgment correct.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">992</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But he, who having right opinion about anything, can find out the difference which distinguishes it from other things will know that of which before he had only an opinion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">993</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; that is what we are maintaining.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">994</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Nevertheless, Theaetetus, on a nearer view, I find myself quite disappointed; the picture, which at a distance was not so bad, has now become altogether unintelligible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">995</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">996</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I will endeavour to explain:  I will suppose myself to have true opinion of you, and if to this I add your definition, then I have knowledge, but if not, opinion only.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">997</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">998</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The definition was assumed to be the interpretation of your difference.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">999</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1000</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But when I had only opinion, I had no conception of your distinguishing characteristics.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1001</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1002</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then I must have conceived of some general or common nature which no more belonged to you than to another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1003</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1004</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Tell me, now—How in that case could I have formed a judgment of you any more than of any one else?</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose that I imagine Theaetetus to be a man who has nose, eyes, and mouth, and every other member complete; how would that enable me to distinguish Theaetetus from Theodorus, or from some outer barbarian?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1005</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  How could it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1006</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Or if I had further conceived of you, not only as having nose and eyes, but as having a snub nose and prominent eyes, should I have any more notion of you than of myself and others who resemble me?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1007</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1008</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Surely I can have no conception of Theaetetus until your snub-nosedness has left an impression on my mind different from the snub-nosedness of all others whom I have ever seen, and until your other peculiarities have a like distinctness; and so when I meet you to-morrow the right opinion will be re-called?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1009</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1010</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then right opinion implies the perception of differences?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1011</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1012</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What, then, shall we say of adding reason or explanation to right opinion?</div><div class="sentence"> If the meaning is, that we should form an opinion of the way in which something differs from another thing, the proposal is ridiculous.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1013</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1014</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We are supposed to acquire a right opinion of the differences which distinguish one thing from another when we have already a right opinion of them, and so we go round and round: —the revolution of the scytal, or pestle, or any other rotatory machine, in the same circles, is as nothing compared with such a requirement; and we may be truly described as the blind directing the blind; for to add those things which we already have, in order that we may learn what we already think, is like a soul utterly benighted.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1015</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Tell me; what were you going to say just now, when you asked the question?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1016</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  If, my boy, the argument, in speaking of adding the definition, had used the word to 'know,' and not merely 'have an opinion' of the difference, this which is the most promising of all the definitions of knowledge would have come to a pretty end, for to know is surely to acquire knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1017</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1018</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And so, when the question is asked, What is knowledge?</div><div class="sentence"> this fair argument will answer 'Right opinion with knowledge,'—knowledge, that is, of difference, for this, as the said argument maintains, is adding the definition.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1019</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  That seems to be true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1020</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But how utterly foolish, when we are asking what is knowledge, that the reply should only be, right opinion with knowledge of difference or of anything!</div><div class="sentence"> And so, Theaetetus, knowledge is neither sensation nor true opinion, nor yet definition and explanation accompanying and added to true opinion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1021</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1022</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And are you still in labour and travail, my dear friend, or have you brought all that you have to say about knowledge to the birth?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1023</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  I am sure, Socrates, that you have elicited from me a good deal more than ever was in me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1024</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And does not my art show that you have brought forth wind, and that the offspring of your brain are not worth bringing up?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1025</span><div class="speaker">THEAETETUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1026</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if, Theaetetus, you should ever conceive afresh, you will be all the better for the present investigation, and if not, you will be soberer and humbler and gentler to other men, and will be too modest to fancy that you know what you do not know.</div><div class="sentence"> These are the limits of my art; I can no further go, nor do I know aught of the things which great and famous men know or have known in this or former ages.</div><div class="sentence"> The office of a midwife I, like my mother, have received from God; she delivered women, I deliver men; but they must be young and noble and fair.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1027</span> <div class="sentence">  And now I have to go to the porch of the King Archon, where I am to meet Meletus and his indictment.</div><div class="sentence"> To-morrow morning, Theodorus, I shall hope to see you again at this place.</div></div>
