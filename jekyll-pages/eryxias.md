<h2>APPENDIX II.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  The two dialogues which are translated in the second appendix are not mentioned by Aristotle, or by any early authority, and have no claim to be ascribed to Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> They are examples of Platonic dialogues to be assigned probably to the second or third generation after Plato, when his writings were well known at Athens and Alexandria.</div><div class="sentence"> They exhibit considerable originality, and are remarkable for containing several thoughts of the sort which we suppose to be modern rather than ancient, and which therefore have a peculiar interest for us.</div><div class="sentence"> The Second Alcibiades shows that the difficulties about prayer which have perplexed Christian theologians were not unknown among the followers of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> The Eryxias was doubted by the ancients themselves: yet it may claim the distinction of being, among all Greek or Roman writings, the one which anticipates in the most striking manner the modern science of political economy and gives an abstract form to some of its principal doctrines.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  For the translation of these two dialogues I am indebted to my friend and secretary, Mr. Knight.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  That the Dialogue which goes by the name of the Second Alcibiades is a genuine writing of Plato will not be maintained by any modern critic, and was hardly believed by the ancients themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> The dialectic is poor and weak.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no power over language, or beauty of style; and there is a certain abruptness and agroikia in the conversation, which is very un-Platonic.</div><div class="sentence"> The best passage is probably that about the poets:—the remark that the poet, who is of a reserved disposition, is uncommonly difficult to understand, and the ridiculous interpretation of Homer, are entirely in the spirit of Plato (compare Protag; Ion; Apol.).</div><div class="sentence"> The characters are ill-drawn.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates assumes the 'superior person' and preaches too much, while Alcibiades is stupid and heavy-in-hand.</div><div class="sentence"> There are traces of Stoic influence in the general tone and phraseology of the Dialogue (compare opos melesei tis...kaka: oti pas aphron mainetai): and the writer seems to have been acquainted with the 'Laws' of Plato (compare Laws).</div><div class="sentence"> An incident from the Symposium is rather clumsily introduced, and two somewhat hackneyed quotations (Symp., Gorg.)</div><div class="sentence"> recur.</div><div class="sentence"> The reference to the death of Archelaus as having occurred 'quite lately' is only a fiction, probably suggested by the Gorgias, where the story of Archelaus is told, and a similar phrase occurs;—ta gar echthes kai proen gegonota tauta, k.t.l.</div><div class="sentence"> There are several passages which are either corrupt or extremely ill-expressed.</div><div class="sentence"> But there is a modern interest in the subject of the dialogue; and it is a good example of a short spurious work, which may be attributed to the second or third century before Christ.</div></div>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  Much cannot be said in praise of the style or conception of the Eryxias.</div><div class="sentence"> It is frequently obscure; like the exercise of a student, it is full of small imitations of Plato:—Phaeax returning from an expedition to Sicily (compare Socrates in the Charmides from the army at Potidaea), the figure of the game at draughts, borrowed from the Republic, etc.</div><div class="sentence"> It has also in many passages the ring of sophistry.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, the rather unhandsome treatment which is exhibited towards Prodicus is quite unlike the urbanity of Plato.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Yet there are some points in the argument which are deserving of attention.</div><div class="sentence"> (1) That wealth depends upon the need of it or demand for it, is the first anticipation in an abstract form of one of the great principles of modern political economy, and the nearest approach to it to be found in an ancient writer.</div><div class="sentence"> (2) The resolution of wealth into its simplest implements going on to infinity is a subtle and refined thought.</div><div class="sentence"> (3) That wealth is relative to circumstances is a sound conception.</div><div class="sentence"> (4) That the arts and sciences which receive payment are likewise to be comprehended under the notion of wealth, also touches a question of modern political economy.</div><div class="sentence"> (5) The distinction of post hoc and propter hoc, often lost sight of in modern as well as in ancient times.</div><div class="sentence"> These metaphysical conceptions and distinctions show considerable power of thought in the writer, whatever we may think of his merits as an imitator of Plato.</div></div>

<h2>ERYXIAS</h2>



<div class="description">
<div class="book_description">PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:</div> Socrates, Eryxias, Erasistratus, Critias. 
</div>
<div class="description">
<div class="book_description">SCENE:</div> The portico of a temple of Zeus. 
</div><div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  It happened by chance that Eryxias the Steirian was walking with me in the Portico of Zeus the Deliverer, when there came up to us Critias and Erasistratus, the latter the son of Phaeax, who was the nephew of Erasistratus.</div><div class="sentence"> Now Erasistratus had just arrived from Sicily and that part of the world.</div><div class="sentence"> As they approached, he said, Hail, Socrates!</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The same to you, I said; have you any good news from Sicily to tell us?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span><div class="speaker">ERASISTRATUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most excellent.</div><div class="sentence"> But, if you please, let us first sit down; for I am tired with my yesterday's journey from Megara.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Gladly, if that is your desire.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span><div class="speaker">ERASISTRATUS</div><div class="sentence">  What would you wish to hear first?</div><div class="sentence"> he said.</div><div class="sentence"> What the Sicilians are doing, or how they are disposed towards our city?</div><div class="sentence"> To my mind, they are very like wasps:  so long as you only cause them a little annoyance they are quite unmanageable; you must destroy their nests if you wish to get the better of them.</div><div class="sentence"> And in a similar way, the Syracusans, unless we set to work in earnest, and go against them with a great expedition, will never submit to our rule.</div><div class="sentence"> The petty injuries which we at present inflict merely irritate them enough to make them utterly intractable.</div><div class="sentence"> And now they have sent ambassadors to Athens, and intend, I suspect, to play us some trick.—While we were talking, the Syracusan envoys chanced to go by, and Erasistratus, pointing to one of them, said to me, That, Socrates, is the richest man in all Italy and Sicily.</div><div class="sentence"> For who has larger estates or more land at his disposal to cultivate if he please?</div><div class="sentence"> And they are of a quality, too, finer than any other land in Hellas.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover, he has all the things which go to make up wealth, slaves and horses innumerable, gold and silver without end.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  I saw that he was inclined to expatiate on the riches of the man; so I asked him, Well, Erasistratus, and what sort of character does he bear in Sicily?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span><div class="speaker">ERASISTRATUS</div><div class="sentence">  He is esteemed to be, and really is, the wickedest of all the Sicilians and Italians, and even more wicked than he is rich; indeed, if you were to ask any Sicilian whom he thought to be the worst and the richest of mankind, you would never hear any one else named.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  I reflected that we were speaking, not of trivial matters, but about wealth and virtue, which are deemed to be of the greatest moment, and I asked Erasistratus whom he considered the wealthier,—he who was the possessor of a talent of silver or he who had a field worth two talents?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span><div class="speaker">ERASISTRATUS</div><div class="sentence">  The owner of the field.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And on the same principle he who had robes and bedding and such things which are of greater value to him than to a stranger would be richer than the stranger?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span><div class="speaker">ERASISTRATUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if any one gave you a choice, which of these would you prefer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span><div class="speaker">ERASISTRATUS</div><div class="sentence">  That which was most valuable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In which way do you think you would be the richer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span><div class="speaker">ERASISTRATUS</div><div class="sentence">  By choosing as I said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And he appears to you to be the richest who has goods of the greatest value?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span><div class="speaker">ERASISTRATUS</div><div class="sentence">  He does.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And are not the healthy richer than the sick, since health is a possession more valuable than riches to the sick?</div><div class="sentence"> Surely there is no one who would not prefer to be poor and well, rather than to have all the King of Persia's wealth and to be ill. And this proves that men set health above wealth, else they would never choose the one in preference to the other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span><div class="speaker">ERASISTRATUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if anything appeared to be more valuable than health, he would be the richest who possessed it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span><div class="speaker">ERASISTRATUS</div><div class="sentence">  He would.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Suppose that some one came to us at this moment and were to ask, Well, Socrates and Eryxias and Erasistratus, can you tell me what is of the greatest value to men?</div><div class="sentence"> Is it not that of which the possession will best enable a man to advise how his own and his friend's affairs should be administered?—What will be our reply?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span><div class="speaker">ERASISTRATUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should say, Socrates, that happiness was the most precious of human possessions.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Not a bad answer.</div><div class="sentence"> But do we not deem those men who are most prosperous to be the happiest?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span><div class="speaker">ERASISTRATUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is my opinion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And are they not most prosperous who commit the fewest errors in respect either of themselves or of other men?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span><div class="speaker">ERASISTRATUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And they who know what is evil and what is good; what should be done and what should be left undone;—these behave the most wisely and make the fewest mistakes?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span> <div class="sentence">  Erasistratus agreed to this.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then the wisest and those who do best and the most fortunate and the richest would appear to be all one and the same, if wisdom is really the most valuable of our possessions?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, said Eryxias, interposing, but what use would it be if a man had the wisdom of Nestor and wanted the necessaries of life, food and drink and clothes and the like?</div><div class="sentence"> Where would be the advantage of wisdom then?</div><div class="sentence"> Or how could he be the richest of men who might even have to go begging, because he had not wherewithal to live?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span> <div class="sentence">  I thought that what Eryxias was saying had some weight, and I replied, Would the wise man really suffer in this way, if he were so ill-provided; whereas if he had the house of Polytion, and the house were full of gold and silver, he would lack nothing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span><div class="speaker">ERYXIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; for then he might dispose of his property and obtain in exchange what he needed, or he might sell it for money with which he could supply his wants and in a moment procure abundance of everything.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True, if he could find some one who preferred such a house to the wisdom of Nestor.</div><div class="sentence"> But if there are persons who set great store by wisdom like Nestor's and the advantages accruing from it, to sell these, if he were so disposed, would be easier still.</div><div class="sentence"> Or is a house a most useful and necessary possession, and does it make a great difference in the comfort of life to have a mansion like Polytion's instead of living in a shabby little cottage, whereas wisdom is of small use and it is of no importance whether a man is wise or ignorant about the highest matters?</div><div class="sentence"> Or is wisdom despised of men and can find no buyers, although cypress wood and marble of Pentelicus are eagerly bought by numerous purchasers?</div><div class="sentence"> Surely the prudent pilot or the skilful physician, or the artist of any kind who is proficient in his art, is more worth than the things which are especially reckoned among riches; and he who can advise well and prudently for himself and others is able also to sell the product of his art, if he so desire.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span> <div class="sentence">  Eryxias looked askance, as if he had received some unfair treatment, and said, I believe, Socrates, that if you were forced to speak the truth, you would declare that you were richer than Callias the son of Hipponicus.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet, although you claimed to be wiser about things of real importance, you would not any the more be richer than he.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span> <div class="sentence">  I dare say, Eryxias, I said, that you may regard these arguments of ours as a kind of game; you think that they have no relation to facts, but are like the pieces in the game of draughts which the player can move in such a way that his opponents are unable to make any countermove.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Republic.)</div><div class="sentence"> And perhaps, too, as regards riches you are of opinion that while facts remain the same, there are arguments, no matter whether true or false, which enable the user of them to prove that the wisest and the richest are one and the same, although he is in the wrong and his opponents are in the right.</div><div class="sentence"> There would be nothing strange in this; it would be as if two persons were to dispute about letters, one declaring that the word Socrates began with an S, the other that it began with an A, and the latter could gain the victory over the former.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span> <div class="sentence">  Eryxias glanced at the audience, laughing and blushing at once, as if he had had nothing to do with what had just been said, and replied,—No, indeed, Socrates, I never supposed that our arguments should be of a kind which would never convince any one of those here present or be of advantage to them.</div><div class="sentence"> For what man of sense could ever be persuaded that the wisest and the richest are the same?</div><div class="sentence"> The truth is that we are discussing the subject of riches, and my notion is that we should argue respecting the honest and dishonest means of acquiring them, and, generally, whether they are a good thing or a bad.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span> <div class="sentence">  Very good, I said, and I am obliged to you for the hint: in future we will be more careful.</div><div class="sentence"> But why do not you yourself, as you introduced the argument, and do not think that the former discussion touched the point at issue, tell us whether you consider riches to be a good or an evil?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span> <div class="sentence">  I am of opinion, he said, that they are a good.</div><div class="sentence"> He was about to add something more, when Critias interrupted him:—Do you really suppose so, Eryxias?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">040</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly, replied Eryxias; I should be mad if I did not: and I do not fancy that you would find any one else of a contrary opinion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span> <div class="sentence">  And I, retorted Critias, should say that there is no one whom I could not compel to admit that riches are bad for some men.</div><div class="sentence"> But surely, if they were a good, they could not appear bad for any one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span> <div class="sentence">  Here I interposed and said to them: If you two were having an argument about equitation and what was the best way of riding, supposing that I knew the art myself, I should try to bring you to an agreement.</div><div class="sentence"> For I should be ashamed if I were present and did not do what I could to prevent your difference.</div><div class="sentence"> And I should do the same if you were quarrelling about any other art and were likely, unless you agreed on the point in dispute, to part as enemies instead of as friends.</div><div class="sentence"> But now, when we are contending about a thing of which the usefulness continues during the whole of life, and it makes an enormous difference whether we are to regard it as beneficial or not,—a thing, too, which is esteemed of the highest importance by the Hellenes:—(for parents, as soon as their children are, as they think, come to years of discretion, urge them to consider how wealth may be acquired, since by riches the value of a man is judged):—When, I say, we are thus in earnest, and you, who agree in other respects, fall to disputing about a matter of such moment, that is, about wealth, and not merely whether it is black or white, light or heavy, but whether it is a good or an evil, whereby, although you are now the dearest of friends and kinsmen, the most bitter hatred may arise betwixt you, I must hinder your dissension to the best of my power.</div><div class="sentence"> If I could, I would tell you the truth, and so put an end to the dispute; but as I cannot do this, and each of you supposes that you can bring the other to an agreement, I am prepared, as far as my capacity admits, to help you in solving the question.</div><div class="sentence"> Please, therefore, Critias, try to make us accept the doctrines which you yourself entertain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">043</span><div class="speaker">CRITIAS</div><div class="sentence">  I should like to follow up the argument, and will ask Eryxias whether he thinks that there are just and unjust men?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">044</span><div class="speaker">ERYXIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Most decidedly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span><div class="speaker">CRITIAS</div><div class="sentence">  And does injustice seem to you an evil or a good?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">046</span><div class="speaker">ERYXIAS</div><div class="sentence">  An evil.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">047</span><div class="speaker">CRITIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Do you consider that he who bribes his neighbour's wife and commits adultery with her, acts justly or unjustly, and this although both the state and the laws forbid?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">048</span><div class="speaker">ERYXIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Unjustly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">049</span><div class="speaker">CRITIAS</div><div class="sentence">  And if the wicked man has wealth and is willing to spend it, he will carry out his evil purposes?</div><div class="sentence"> whereas he who is short of means cannot do what he fain would, and therefore does not sin?</div><div class="sentence"> In such a case, surely, it is better that a person should not be wealthy, if his poverty prevents the accomplishment of his desires, and his desires are evil?</div><div class="sentence"> Or, again, should you call sickness a good or an evil?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">050</span><div class="speaker">ERYXIAS</div><div class="sentence">  An evil.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span><div class="speaker">CRITIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Well, and do you think that some men are intemperate?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span><div class="speaker">ERYXIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span><div class="speaker">CRITIAS</div><div class="sentence">  Then, if it is better for his health that the intemperate man should refrain from meat and drink and other pleasant things, but he cannot owing to his intemperance, will it not also be better that he should be too poor to gratify his lust rather than that he should have a superabundance of means?</div><div class="sentence"> For thus he will not be able to sin, although he desire never so much.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span> <div class="sentence">  Critias appeared to be arguing so admirably that Eryxias, if he had not been ashamed of the bystanders, would probably have got up and struck him.</div><div class="sentence"> For he thought that he had been robbed of a great possession when it became obvious to him that he had been wrong in his former opinion about wealth.</div><div class="sentence"> I observed his vexation, and feared that they would proceed to abuse and quarrelling: so I said,—I heard that very argument used in the Lyceum yesterday by a wise man, Prodicus of Ceos; but the audience thought that he was talking mere nonsense, and no one could be persuaded that he was speaking the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> And when at last a certain talkative young gentleman came in, and, taking his seat, began to laugh and jeer at Prodicus, tormenting him and demanding an explanation of his argument, he gained the ear of the audience far more than Prodicus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span> <div class="sentence">  Can you repeat the discourse to us?</div><div class="sentence"> Said Erasistratus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  If I can only remember it, I will.</div><div class="sentence"> The youth began by asking Prodicus, In what way did he think that riches were a good and in what an evil?</div><div class="sentence"> Prodicus answered, as you did just now, that they were a good to good men and to those who knew in what way they should be employed, while to the bad and the ignorant they were an evil.</div><div class="sentence"> The same is true, he went on to say, of all other things; men make them to be what they are themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> The saying of Archilochus is true: —</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span> <div class="sentence">  'Men's thoughts correspond to the things which they meet with.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, then, replied the youth, if any one makes me wise in that wisdom whereby good men become wise, he must also make everything else good to me.</div><div class="sentence"> Not that he concerns himself at all with these other things, but he has converted my ignorance into wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> If, for example, a person teach me grammar or music, he will at the same time teach me all that relates to grammar or music, and so when he makes me good, he makes things good to me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span> <div class="sentence">  Prodicus did not altogether agree: still he consented to what was said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span> <div class="sentence">  And do you think, said the youth, that doing good things is like building a house,—the work of human agency; or do things remain what they were at first, good or bad, for all time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span> <div class="sentence">  Prodicus began to suspect, I fancy, the direction which the argument was likely to take, and did not wish to be put down by a mere stripling before all those present:—(if they two had been alone, he would not have minded):—so he answered, cleverly enough: I think that doing good things is a work of human agency.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span> <div class="sentence">  And is virtue in your opinion, Prodicus, innate or acquired by instruction?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span> <div class="sentence">  The latter, said Prodicus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span> <div class="sentence">  Then you would consider him a simpleton who supposed that he could obtain by praying to the Gods the knowledge of grammar or music or any other art, which he must either learn from another or find out for himself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span> <div class="sentence">  Prodicus agreed to this also.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span> <div class="sentence">  And when you pray to the Gods that you may do well and receive good, you mean by your prayer nothing else than that you desire to become good and wise:—if, at least, things are good to the good and wise and evil to the evil.</div><div class="sentence"> But in that case, if virtue is acquired by instruction, it would appear that you only pray to be taught what you do not know.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span> <div class="sentence">  Hereupon I said to Prodicus that it was no misfortune to him if he had been proved to be in error in supposing that the Gods immediately granted to us whatever we asked:—if, I added, whenever you go up to the Acropolis you earnestly entreat the Gods to grant you good things, although you know not whether they can yield your request, it is as though you went to the doors of the grammarian and begged him, although you had never made a study of the art, to give you a knowledge of grammar which would enable you forthwith to do the business of a grammarian.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span> <div class="sentence">  While I was speaking, Prodicus was preparing to retaliate upon his youthful assailant, intending to employ the argument of which you have just made use; for he was annoyed to have it supposed that he offered a vain prayer to the Gods.</div><div class="sentence"> But the master of the gymnasium came to him and begged him to leave because he was teaching the youths doctrines which were unsuited to them, and therefore bad for them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span> <div class="sentence">  I have told you this because I want you to understand how men are circumstanced in regard to philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> Had Prodicus been present and said what you have said, the audience would have thought him raving, and he would have been ejected from the gymnasium.</div><div class="sentence"> But you have argued so excellently well that you have not only persuaded your hearers, but have brought your opponent to an agreement.</div><div class="sentence"> For just as in the law courts, if two witnesses testify to the same fact, one of whom seems to be an honest fellow and the other a rogue, the testimony of the rogue often has the contrary effect on the judges' minds to what he intended, while the same evidence if given by the honest man at once strikes them as perfectly true.</div><div class="sentence"> And probably the audience have something of the same feeling about yourself and Prodicus; they think him a Sophist and a braggart, and regard you as a gentleman of courtesy and worth.</div><div class="sentence"> For they do not pay attention to the argument so much as to the character of the speaker.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span> <div class="sentence">  But truly, Socrates, said Erasistratus, though you may be joking, Critias does seem to me to be saying something which is of weight.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I am in profound earnest, I assure you.</div><div class="sentence"> But why, as you have begun your argument so prettily, do you not go on with the rest?</div><div class="sentence"> There is still something lacking, now you have agreed that (wealth) is a good to some and an evil to others.</div><div class="sentence"> It remains to enquire what constitutes wealth; for unless you know this, you cannot possibly come to an understanding as to whether it is a good or an evil.</div><div class="sentence"> I am ready to assist you in the enquiry to the utmost of my power:  but first let him who affirms that riches are a good, tell us what, in his opinion, is wealth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span><div class="speaker">ERASISTRATUS</div><div class="sentence">  Indeed, Socrates, I have no notion about wealth beyond that which men commonly have.</div><div class="sentence"> I suppose that wealth is a quantity of money (compare Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Pol.</div><div class="sentence"> ); and this, I imagine, would also be Critias' definition.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then now we have to consider, What is money?</div><div class="sentence"> Or else later on we shall be found to differ about the question.</div><div class="sentence"> For instance, the Carthaginians use money of this sort.</div><div class="sentence"> Something which is about the size of a stater is tied up in a small piece of leather:  what it is, no one knows but the makers.</div><div class="sentence"> A seal is next set upon the leather, which then passes into circulation, and he who has the largest number of such pieces is esteemed the richest and best off.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet if any one among us had a mass of such coins he would be no wealthier than if he had so many pebbles from the mountain.</div><div class="sentence"> At Lacedaemon, again, they use iron by weight which has been rendered useless:  and he who has the greatest mass of such iron is thought to be the richest, although elsewhere it has no value.</div><div class="sentence"> In Ethiopia engraved stones are employed, of which a Lacedaemonian could make no use.</div><div class="sentence"> Once more, among the Nomad Scythians a man who owned the house of Polytion would not be thought richer than one who possessed Mount Lycabettus among ourselves.</div><div class="sentence"> And clearly those things cannot all be regarded as possessions; for in some cases the possessors would appear none the richer thereby:  but, as I was saying, some one of them is thought in one place to be money, and the possessors of it are the wealthy, whereas in some other place it is not money, and the ownership of it does not confer wealth; just as the standard of morals varies, and what is honourable to some men is dishonourable to others.</div><div class="sentence"> And if we wish to enquire why a house is valuable to us but not to the Scythians, or why the Carthaginians value leather which is worthless to us, or the Lacedaemonians find wealth in iron and we do not, can we not get an answer in some such way as this:  Would an Athenian, who had a thousand talents weight of the stones which lie about in the Agora and which we do not employ for any purpose, be thought to be any the richer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">074</span><div class="speaker">ERASISTRATUS</div><div class="sentence">  He certainly would not appear so to me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if he possessed a thousand talents weight of some precious stone, we should say that he was very rich?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The reason is that the one is useless and the other useful?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">079</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And in the same way among the Scythians a house has no value because they have no use for a house, nor would a Scythian set so much store on the finest house in the world as on a leather coat, because he could use the one and not the other.</div><div class="sentence"> Or again, the Carthaginian coinage is not wealth in our eyes, for we could not employ it, as we can silver, to procure what we need, and therefore it is of no use to us.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then our conclusion is, as would appear, that wealth is what is useful to this end?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And how would you answer another question?</div><div class="sentence"> There are persons, are there not, who teach music and grammar and other arts for pay, and thus procure those things of which they stand in need?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then if these arts are reckoned among things useful, the arts are wealth for the same reason as gold and silver are, for, clearly, the possession of them gives wealth.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet a little while ago we found it difficult to accept the argument which proved that the wisest are the wealthiest.</div><div class="sentence"> But now there seems no escape from this conclusion.</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose that we are asked, 'Is a horse useful to everybody?'</div><div class="sentence"> will not our reply be, 'No, but only to those who know how to use a horse?'</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">131</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if they appear useless to this end, ought they not always to appear useless?</div><div class="sentence"> For we have already laid down the principle that things cannot be at one time useful and at another time not, in the same process.</div></div>
