<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  After an interval of some months or years, and at Phlius, a town of Peloponnesus, the tale of the last hours of Socrates is narrated to Echecrates and other Phliasians by Phaedo the 'beloved disciple.'</div><div class="sentence"> The Dialogue necessarily takes the form of a narrative, because Socrates has to be described acting as well as speaking.</div><div class="sentence"> The minutest particulars of the event are interesting to distant friends, and the narrator has an equal interest in them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  During the voyage of the sacred ship to and from Delos, which has occupied thirty days, the execution of Socrates has been deferred.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Xen.</div><div class="sentence"> Mem.)</div><div class="sentence"> The time has been passed by him in conversation with a select company of disciples.</div><div class="sentence"> But now the holy season is over, and the disciples meet earlier than usual in order that they may converse with Socrates for the last time.</div><div class="sentence"> Those who were present, and those who might have been expected to be present, are mentioned by name.</div><div class="sentence"> There are Simmias and Cebes (Crito), two disciples of Philolaus whom Socrates 'by his enchantments has attracted from Thebes' (Mem.</div><div class="sentence"> ), Crito the aged friend, the attendant of the prison, who is as good as a friend—these take part in the conversation.</div><div class="sentence"> There are present also, Hermogenes, from whom Xenophon derived his information about the trial of Socrates (Mem.</div><div class="sentence"> ), the 'madman' Apollodorus (Symp.</div><div class="sentence"> ), Euclid and Terpsion from Megara (compare Theaet.</div><div class="sentence"> ), Ctesippus, Antisthenes, Menexenus, and some other less-known members of the Socratic circle, all of whom are silent auditors.</div><div class="sentence"> Aristippus, Cleombrotus, and Plato are noted as absent.</div><div class="sentence"> Almost as soon as the friends of Socrates enter the prison Xanthippe and her children are sent home in the care of one of Crito's servants.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates himself has just been released from chains, and is led by this circumstance to make the natural remark that 'pleasure follows pain.'</div><div class="sentence"> (Observe that Plato is preparing the way for his doctrine of the alternation of opposites.)</div><div class="sentence"> 'Aesop would have represented them in a fable as a two-headed creature of the gods.'</div><div class="sentence"> The mention of Aesop reminds Cebes of a question which had been asked by Evenus the poet (compare Apol.</div><div class="sentence"> ): 'Why Socrates, who was not a poet, while in prison had been putting Aesop into verse?</div><div class="sentence"> '—'Because several times in his life he had been warned in dreams that he should practise music; and as he was about to die and was not certain of what was meant, he wished to fulfil the admonition in the letter as well as in the spirit, by writing verses as well as by cultivating philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> Tell this to Evenus; and say that I would have him follow me in death.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'He is not at all the sort of man to comply with your request, Socrates.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Why, is he not a philosopher?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Yes.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Then he will be willing to die, although he will not take his own life, for that is held to be unlawful.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Cebes asks why suicide is thought not to be right, if death is to be accounted a good?</div><div class="sentence"> Well, (1) according to one explanation, because man is a prisoner, who must not open the door of his prison and run away—this is the truth in a 'mystery.'</div><div class="sentence"> Or (2) rather, because he is not his own property, but a possession of the gods, and has no right to make away with that which does not belong to him.</div><div class="sentence"> But why, asks Cebes, if he is a possession of the gods, should he wish to die and leave them?</div><div class="sentence"> For he is under their protection; and surely he cannot take better care of himself than they take of him.</div><div class="sentence"> Simmias explains that Cebes is really referring to Socrates, whom they think too unmoved at the prospect of leaving the gods and his friends.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates answers that he is going to other gods who are wise and good, and perhaps to better friends; and he professes that he is ready to defend himself against the charge of Cebes.</div><div class="sentence"> The company shall be his judges, and he hopes that he will be more successful in convincing them than he had been in convincing the court.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  The philosopher desires death—which the wicked world will insinuate that he also deserves: and perhaps he does, but not in any sense which they are capable of understanding.</div><div class="sentence"> Enough of them: the real question is, What is the nature of that death which he desires?</div><div class="sentence"> Death is the separation of soul and body—and the philosopher desires such a separation.</div><div class="sentence"> He would like to be freed from the dominion of bodily pleasures and of the senses, which are always perturbing his mental vision.</div><div class="sentence"> He wants to get rid of eyes and ears, and with the light of the mind only to behold the light of truth.</div><div class="sentence"> All the evils and impurities and necessities of men come from the body.</div><div class="sentence"> And death separates him from these corruptions, which in life he cannot wholly lay aside.</div><div class="sentence"> Why then should he repine when the hour of separation arrives?</div><div class="sentence"> Why, if he is dead while he lives, should he fear that other death, through which alone he can behold wisdom in her purity?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  Besides, the philosopher has notions of good and evil unlike those of other men.</div><div class="sentence"> For they are courageous because they are afraid of greater dangers, and temperate because they desire greater pleasures.</div><div class="sentence"> But he disdains this balancing of pleasures and pains, which is the exchange of commerce and not of virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> All the virtues, including wisdom, are regarded by him only as purifications of the soul.</div><div class="sentence"> And this was the meaning of the founders of the mysteries when they said, 'Many are the wand-bearers but few are the mystics.'</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Matt.</div><div class="sentence"> xxii.</div><div class="sentence"> : 'Many are called but few are chosen.')</div><div class="sentence"> And in the hope that he is one of these mystics, Socrates is now departing.</div><div class="sentence"> This is his answer to any one who charges him with indifference at the prospect of leaving the gods and his friends.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  Still, a fear is expressed that the soul upon leaving the body may vanish away like smoke or air.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates in answer appeals first of all to the old Orphic tradition that the souls of the dead are in the world below, and that the living come from them.</div><div class="sentence"> This he attempts to found on a philosophical assumption that all opposites—e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> less, greater; weaker, stronger; sleeping, waking; life, death—are generated out of each other.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor can the process of generation be only a passage from living to dying, for then all would end in death.</div><div class="sentence"> The perpetual sleeper (Endymion) would be no longer distinguished from the rest of mankind.</div><div class="sentence"> The circle of nature is not complete unless the living come from the dead as well as pass to them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  The Platonic doctrine of reminiscence is then adduced as a confirmation of the pre-existence of the soul.</div><div class="sentence"> Some proofs of this doctrine are demanded.</div><div class="sentence"> One proof given is the same as that of the Meno, and is derived from the latent knowledge of mathematics, which may be elicited from an unlearned person when a diagram is presented to him.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, there is a power of association, which from seeing Simmias may remember Cebes, or from seeing a picture of Simmias may remember Simmias.</div><div class="sentence"> The lyre may recall the player of the lyre, and equal pieces of wood or stone may be associated with the higher notion of absolute equality.</div><div class="sentence"> But here observe that material equalities fall short of the conception of absolute equality with which they are compared, and which is the measure of them.</div><div class="sentence"> And the measure or standard must be prior to that which is measured, the idea of equality prior to the visible equals.</div><div class="sentence"> And if prior to them, then prior also to the perceptions of the senses which recall them, and therefore either given before birth or at birth.</div><div class="sentence"> But all men have not this knowledge, nor have any without a process of reminiscence; which is a proof that it is not innate or given at birth, unless indeed it was given and taken away at the same instant.</div><div class="sentence"> But if not given to men in birth, it must have been given before birth—this is the only alternative which remains.</div><div class="sentence"> And if we had ideas in a former state, then our souls must have existed and must have had intelligence in a former state.</div><div class="sentence"> The pre-existence of the soul stands or falls with the doctrine of ideas.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  It is objected by Simmias and Cebes that these arguments only prove a former and not a future existence.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates answers this objection by recalling the previous argument, in which he had shown that the living come from the dead.</div><div class="sentence"> But the fear that the soul at departing may vanish into air (especially if there is a wind blowing at the time) has not yet been charmed away.</div><div class="sentence"> He proceeds: When we fear that the soul will vanish away, let us ask ourselves what is that which we suppose to be liable to dissolution?</div><div class="sentence"> Is it the simple or the compound, the unchanging or the changing, the invisible idea or the visible object of sense?</div><div class="sentence"> Clearly the latter and not the former; and therefore not the soul, which in her own pure thought is unchangeable, and only when using the senses descends into the region of change.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, the soul commands, the body serves: in this respect too the soul is akin to the divine, and the body to the mortal.</div><div class="sentence"> And in every point of view the soul is the image of divinity and immortality, and the body of the human and mortal.</div><div class="sentence"> And whereas the body is liable to speedy dissolution, the soul is almost if not quite indissoluble.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Tim.)</div><div class="sentence"> Yet even the body may be preserved for ages by the embalmer's art: how unlikely, then, that the soul will perish and be dissipated into air while on her way to the good and wise God!</div><div class="sentence"> She has been gathered into herself, holding aloof from the body, and practising death all her life long, and she is now finally released from the errors and follies and passions of men, and for ever dwells in the company of the gods.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span> <div class="sentence">  But the soul which is polluted and engrossed by the corporeal, and has no eye except that of the senses, and is weighed down by the bodily appetites, cannot attain to this abstraction.</div><div class="sentence"> In her fear of the world below she lingers about the sepulchre, loath to leave the body which she loved, a ghostly apparition, saturated with sense, and therefore visible.</div><div class="sentence"> At length entering into some animal of a nature congenial to her former life of sensuality or violence, she takes the form of an ass, a wolf or a kite.</div><div class="sentence"> And of these earthly souls the happiest are those who have practised virtue without philosophy; they are allowed to pass into gentle and social natures, such as bees and ants.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Republic, Meno.)</div><div class="sentence"> But only the philosopher who departs pure is permitted to enter the company of the gods.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Phaedrus.)</div><div class="sentence"> This is the reason why he abstains from fleshly lusts, and not because he fears loss or disgrace, which is the motive of other men.</div><div class="sentence"> He too has been a captive, and the willing agent of his own captivity.</div><div class="sentence"> But philosophy has spoken to him, and he has heard her voice; she has gently entreated him, and brought him out of the 'miry clay,' and purged away the mists of passion and the illusions of sense which envelope him; his soul has escaped from the influence of pleasures and pains, which are like nails fastening her to the body.</div><div class="sentence"> To that prison-house she will not return; and therefore she abstains from bodily pleasures—not from a desire of having more or greater ones, but because she knows that only when calm and free from the dominion of the body can she behold the light of truth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span> <div class="sentence">  Simmias and Cebes remain in doubt; but they are unwilling to raise objections at such a time.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates wonders at their reluctance.</div><div class="sentence"> Let them regard him rather as the swan, who, having sung the praises of Apollo all his life long, sings at his death more lustily than ever.</div><div class="sentence"> Simmias acknowledges that there is cowardice in not probing truth to the bottom.</div><div class="sentence"> 'And if truth divine and inspired is not to be had, then let a man take the best of human notions, and upon this frail bark let him sail through life.'</div><div class="sentence"> He proceeds to state his difficulty: It has been argued that the soul is invisible and incorporeal, and therefore immortal, and prior to the body.</div><div class="sentence"> But is not the soul acknowledged to be a harmony, and has she not the same relation to the body, as the harmony—which like her is invisible—has to the lyre?</div><div class="sentence"> And yet the harmony does not survive the lyre.</div><div class="sentence"> Cebes has also an objection, which like Simmias he expresses in a figure.</div><div class="sentence"> He is willing to admit that the soul is more lasting than the body.</div><div class="sentence"> But the more lasting nature of the soul does not prove her immortality; for after having worn out many bodies in a single life, and many more in successive births and deaths, she may at last perish, or, as Socrates afterwards restates the objection, the very act of birth may be the beginning of her death, and her last body may survive her, just as the coat of an old weaver is left behind him after he is dead, although a man is more lasting than his coat.</div><div class="sentence"> And he who would prove the immortality of the soul, must prove not only that the soul outlives one or many bodies, but that she outlives them all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span> <div class="sentence">  The audience, like the chorus in a play, for a moment interpret the feelings of the actors; there is a temporary depression, and then the enquiry is resumed.</div><div class="sentence"> It is a melancholy reflection that arguments, like men, are apt to be deceivers; and those who have been often deceived become distrustful both of arguments and of friends.</div><div class="sentence"> But this unfortunate experience should not make us either haters of men or haters of arguments.</div><div class="sentence"> The want of health and truth is not in the argument, but in ourselves.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates, who is about to die, is sensible of his own weakness; he desires to be impartial, but he cannot help feeling that he has too great an interest in the truth of the argument.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore he would have his friends examine and refute him, if they think that he is in error.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span> <div class="sentence">  At his request Simmias and Cebes repeat their objections.</div><div class="sentence"> They do not go to the length of denying the pre-existence of ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> Simmias is of opinion that the soul is a harmony of the body.</div><div class="sentence"> But the admission of the pre-existence of ideas, and therefore of the soul, is at variance with this.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare a parallel difficulty in Theaet.)</div><div class="sentence"> For a harmony is an effect, whereas the soul is not an effect, but a cause; a harmony follows, but the soul leads; a harmony admits of degrees, and the soul has no degrees.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, upon the supposition that the soul is a harmony, why is one soul better than another?</div><div class="sentence"> Are they more or less harmonized, or is there one harmony within another?</div><div class="sentence"> But the soul does not admit of degrees, and cannot therefore be more or less harmonized.</div><div class="sentence"> Further, the soul is often engaged in resisting the affections of the body, as Homer describes Odysseus 'rebuking his heart.'</div><div class="sentence"> Could he have written this under the idea that the soul is a harmony of the body?</div><div class="sentence"> Nay rather, are we not contradicting Homer and ourselves in affirming anything of the sort?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span> <div class="sentence">  The goddess Harmonia, as Socrates playfully terms the argument of Simmias, has been happily disposed of; and now an answer has to be given to the Theban Cadmus.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates recapitulates the argument of Cebes, which, as he remarks, involves the whole question of natural growth or causation; about this he proposes to narrate his own mental experience.</div><div class="sentence"> When he was young he had puzzled himself with physics: he had enquired into the growth and decay of animals, and the origin of thought, until at last he began to doubt the self-evident fact that growth is the result of eating and drinking; and so he arrived at the conclusion that he was not meant for such enquiries.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor was he less perplexed with notions of comparison and number.</div><div class="sentence"> At first he had imagined himself to understand differences of greater and less, and to know that ten is two more than eight, and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> But now those very notions appeared to him to contain a contradiction.</div><div class="sentence"> For how can one be divided into two?</div><div class="sentence"> Or two be compounded into one?</div><div class="sentence"> These are difficulties which Socrates cannot answer.</div><div class="sentence"> Of generation and destruction he knows nothing.</div><div class="sentence"> But he has a confused notion of another method in which matters of this sort are to be investigated.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Republic; Charm.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span> <div class="sentence">  Then he heard some one reading out of a book of Anaxagoras, that mind is the cause of all things.</div><div class="sentence"> And he said to himself: If mind is the cause of all things, surely mind must dispose them all for the best.</div><div class="sentence"> The new teacher will show me this 'order of the best' in man and nature.</div><div class="sentence"> How great had been his hopes and how great his disappointment!</div><div class="sentence"> For he found that his new friend was anything but consistent in his use of mind as a cause, and that he soon introduced winds, waters, and other eccentric notions.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Metaph.)</div><div class="sentence"> It was as if a person had said that Socrates is sitting here because he is made up of bones and muscles, instead of telling the true reason—that he is here because the Athenians have thought good to sentence him to death, and he has thought good to await his sentence.</div><div class="sentence"> Had his bones and muscles been left by him to their own ideas of right, they would long ago have taken themselves off.</div><div class="sentence"> But surely there is a great confusion of the cause and condition in all this.</div><div class="sentence"> And this confusion also leads people into all sorts of erroneous theories about the position and motions of the earth.</div><div class="sentence"> None of them know how much stronger than any Atlas is the power of the best.</div><div class="sentence"> But this 'best' is still undiscovered; and in enquiring after the cause, we can only hope to attain the second best.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span> <div class="sentence">  Now there is a danger in the contemplation of the nature of things, as there is a danger in looking at the sun during an eclipse, unless the precaution is taken of looking only at the image reflected in the water, or in a glass.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Laws; Republic.)</div><div class="sentence"> 'I was afraid,' says Socrates, 'that I might injure the eye of the soul.</div><div class="sentence"> I thought that I had better return to the old and safe method of ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> Though I do not mean to say that he who contemplates existence through the medium of ideas sees only through a glass darkly, any more than he who contemplates actual effects.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span> <div class="sentence">  If the existence of ideas is granted to him, Socrates is of opinion that he will then have no difficulty in proving the immortality of the soul.</div><div class="sentence"> He will only ask for a further admission:—that beauty is the cause of the beautiful, greatness the cause of the great, smallness of the small, and so on of other things.</div><div class="sentence"> This is a safe and simple answer, which escapes the contradictions of greater and less (greater by reason of that which is smaller!</div><div class="sentence"> ), of addition and subtraction, and the other difficulties of relation.</div><div class="sentence"> These subtleties he is for leaving to wiser heads than his own; he prefers to test ideas by the consistency of their consequences, and, if asked to give an account of them, goes back to some higher idea or hypothesis which appears to him to be the best, until at last he arrives at a resting-place.</div><div class="sentence"> (Republic; Phil.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span> <div class="sentence">  The doctrine of ideas, which has long ago received the assent of the Socratic circle, is now affirmed by the Phliasian auditor to command the assent of any man of sense.</div><div class="sentence"> The narrative is continued; Socrates is desirous of explaining how opposite ideas may appear to co-exist but do not really co-exist in the same thing or person.</div><div class="sentence"> For example, Simmias may be said to have greatness and also smallness, because he is greater than Socrates and less than Phaedo.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet Simmias is not really great and also small, but only when compared to Phaedo and Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> I use the illustration, says Socrates, because I want to show you not only that ideal opposites exclude one another, but also the opposites in us.</div><div class="sentence"> I, for example, having the attribute of smallness remain small, and cannot become great: the smallness which is in me drives out greatness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span> <div class="sentence">  One of the company here remarked that this was inconsistent with the old assertion that opposites generated opposites.</div><div class="sentence"> But that, replies Socrates, was affirmed, not of opposite ideas either in us or in nature, but of opposition in the concrete—not of life and death, but of individuals living and dying.</div><div class="sentence"> When this objection has been removed, Socrates proceeds: This doctrine of the mutual exclusion of opposites is not only true of the opposites themselves, but of things which are inseparable from them.</div><div class="sentence"> For example, cold and heat are opposed; and fire, which is inseparable from heat, cannot co-exist with cold, or snow, which is inseparable from cold, with heat.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, the number three excludes the number four, because three is an odd number and four is an even number, and the odd is opposed to the even.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus we are able to proceed a step beyond 'the safe and simple answer.'</div><div class="sentence"> We may say, not only that the odd excludes the even, but that the number three, which participates in oddness, excludes the even.</div><div class="sentence"> And in like manner, not only does life exclude death, but the soul, of which life is the inseparable attribute, also excludes death.</div><div class="sentence"> And that of which life is the inseparable attribute is by the force of the terms imperishable.</div><div class="sentence"> If the odd principle were imperishable, then the number three would not perish but remove, on the approach of the even principle.</div><div class="sentence"> But the immortal is imperishable; and therefore the soul on the approach of death does not perish but removes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span> <div class="sentence">  Thus all objections appear to be finally silenced.</div><div class="sentence"> And now the application has to be made: If the soul is immortal, 'what manner of persons ought we to be?'</div><div class="sentence"> having regard not only to time but to eternity.</div><div class="sentence"> For death is not the end of all, and the wicked is not released from his evil by death; but every one carries with him into the world below that which he is or has become, and that only.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span> <div class="sentence">  For after death the soul is carried away to judgment, and when she has received her punishment returns to earth in the course of ages.</div><div class="sentence"> The wise soul is conscious of her situation, and follows the attendant angel who guides her through the windings of the world below; but the impure soul wanders hither and thither without companion or guide, and is carried at last to her own place, as the pure soul is also carried away to hers.</div><div class="sentence"> 'In order that you may understand this, I must first describe to you the nature and conformation of the earth.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span> <div class="sentence">  Now the whole earth is a globe placed in the centre of the heavens, and is maintained there by the perfection of balance.</div><div class="sentence"> That which we call the earth is only one of many small hollows, wherein collect the mists and waters and the thick lower air; but the true earth is above, and is in a finer and subtler element.</div><div class="sentence"> And if, like birds, we could fly to the surface of the air, in the same manner that fishes come to the top of the sea, then we should behold the true earth and the true heaven and the true stars.</div><div class="sentence"> Our earth is everywhere corrupted and corroded; and even the land which is fairer than the sea, for that is a mere chaos or waste of water and mud and sand, has nothing to show in comparison of the other world.</div><div class="sentence"> But the heavenly earth is of divers colours, sparkling with jewels brighter than gold and whiter than any snow, having flowers and fruits innumerable.</div><div class="sentence"> And the inhabitants dwell some on the shore of the sea of air, others in 'islets of the blest,' and they hold converse with the gods, and behold the sun, moon and stars as they truly are, and their other blessedness is of a piece with this.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span> <div class="sentence">  The hollows on the surface of the globe vary in size and shape from that which we inhabit: but all are connected by passages and perforations in the interior of the earth.</div><div class="sentence"> And there is one huge chasm or opening called Tartarus, into which streams of fire and water and liquid mud are ever flowing; of these small portions find their way to the surface and form seas and rivers and volcanoes.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a perpetual inhalation and exhalation of the air rising and falling as the waters pass into the depths of the earth and return again, in their course forming lakes and rivers, but never descending below the centre of the earth; for on either side the rivers flowing either way are stopped by a precipice.</div><div class="sentence"> These rivers are many and mighty, and there are four principal ones, Oceanus, Acheron, Pyriphlegethon, and Cocytus.</div><div class="sentence"> Oceanus is the river which encircles the earth; Acheron takes an opposite direction, and after flowing under the earth through desert places, at last reaches the Acherusian lake,—this is the river at which the souls of the dead await their return to earth.</div><div class="sentence"> Pyriphlegethon is a stream of fire, which coils round the earth and flows into the depths of Tartarus.</div><div class="sentence"> The fourth river, Cocytus, is that which is called by the poets the Stygian river, and passes into and forms the lake Styx, from the waters of which it gains new and strange powers.</div><div class="sentence"> This river, too, falls into Tartarus.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span> <div class="sentence">  As in several other Dialogues, there is more of system in the Phaedo than appears at first sight.</div><div class="sentence"> The succession of arguments is based on previous philosophies; beginning with the mysteries and the Heracleitean alternation of opposites, and proceeding to the Pythagorean harmony and transmigration; making a step by the aid of Platonic reminiscence, and a further step by the help of the nous of Anaxagoras; until at last we rest in the conviction that the soul is inseparable from the ideas, and belongs to the world of the invisible and unknown.</div><div class="sentence"> Then, as in the Gorgias or Republic, the curtain falls, and the veil of mythology descends upon the argument.</div><div class="sentence"> After the confession of Socrates that he is an interested party, and the acknowledgment that no man of sense will think the details of his narrative true, but that something of the kind is true, we return from speculation to practice.</div><div class="sentence"> He is himself more confident of immortality than he is of his own arguments; and the confidence which he expresses is less strong than that which his cheerfulness and composure in death inspire in us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span> <div class="sentence">  Difficulties of two kinds occur in the Phaedo—one kind to be explained out of contemporary philosophy, the other not admitting of an entire solution.</div><div class="sentence"> (1) The difficulty which Socrates says that he experienced in explaining generation and corruption; the assumption of hypotheses which proceed from the less general to the more general, and are tested by their consequences; the puzzle about greater and less; the resort to the method of ideas, which to us appear only abstract terms,—these are to be explained out of the position of Socrates and Plato in the history of philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> They were living in a twilight between the sensible and the intellectual world, and saw no way of connecting them.</div><div class="sentence"> They could neither explain the relation of ideas to phenomena, nor their correlation to one another.</div><div class="sentence"> The very idea of relation or comparison was embarrassing to them.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet in this intellectual uncertainty they had a conception of a proof from results, and of a moral truth, which remained unshaken amid the questionings of philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> (2) The other is a difficulty which is touched upon in the Republic as well as in the Phaedo, and is common to modern and ancient philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato is not altogether satisfied with his safe and simple method of ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> He wants to have proved to him by facts that all things are for the best, and that there is one mind or design which pervades them all.</div><div class="sentence"> But this 'power of the best' he is unable to explain; and therefore takes refuge in universal ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> And are not we at this day seeking to discover that which Socrates in a glass darkly foresaw?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span> <div class="sentence">  Some resemblances to the Greek drama may be noted in all the Dialogues of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> The Phaedo is the tragedy of which Socrates is the protagonist and Simmias and Cebes the secondary performers, standing to them in the same relation as to Glaucon and Adeimantus in the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> No Dialogue has a greater unity of subject and feeling.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato has certainly fulfilled the condition of Greek, or rather of all art, which requires that scenes of death and suffering should be clothed in beauty.</div><div class="sentence"> The gathering of the friends at the commencement of the Dialogue, the dismissal of Xanthippe, whose presence would have been out of place at a philosophical discussion, but who returns again with her children to take a final farewell, the dejection of the audience at the temporary overthrow of the argument, the picture of Socrates playing with the hair of Phaedo, the final scene in which Socrates alone retains his composure—are masterpieces of art.</div><div class="sentence"> And the chorus at the end might have interpreted the feeling of the play: 'There can no evil happen to a good man in life or death.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span> <div class="sentence">  'The art of concealing art' is nowhere more perfect than in those writings of Plato which describe the trial and death of Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> Their charm is their simplicity, which gives them verisimilitude; and yet they touch, as if incidentally, and because they were suitable to the occasion, on some of the deepest truths of philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> There is nothing in any tragedy, ancient or modern, nothing in poetry or history (with one exception), like the last hours of Socrates in Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> The master could not be more fitly occupied at such a time than in discoursing of immortality; nor the disciples more divinely consoled.</div><div class="sentence"> The arguments, taken in the spirit and not in the letter, are our arguments; and Socrates by anticipation may be even thought to refute some 'eccentric notions; current in our own age.</div><div class="sentence"> For there are philosophers among ourselves who do not seem to understand how much stronger is the power of intelligence, or of the best, than of Atlas, or mechanical force.</div><div class="sentence"> How far the words attributed to Socrates were actually uttered by him we forbear to ask; for no answer can be given to this question.</div><div class="sentence"> And it is better to resign ourselves to the feeling of a great work, than to linger among critical uncertainties.</div></div>

</div><div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span><div class="speaker">ECHECRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Were you yourself, Phaedo, in the prison with Socrates on the day when he drank the poison?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span><div class="speaker">PHAEDO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Echecrates, I was.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span><div class="speaker">ECHECRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I should so like to hear about his death.</div><div class="sentence"> What did he say in his last hours?</div><div class="sentence"> We were informed that he died by taking poison, but no one knew anything more; for no Phliasian ever goes to Athens now, and it is a long time since any stranger from Athens has found his way hither; so that we had no clear account.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span><div class="speaker">PHAEDO</div><div class="sentence">  Did you not hear of the proceedings at the trial?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span><div class="speaker">ECHECRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; some one told us about the trial, and we could not understand why, having been condemned, he should have been put to death, not at the time, but long afterwards.</div><div class="sentence"> What was the reason of this?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span><div class="speaker">PHAEDO</div><div class="sentence">  An accident, Echecrates:  the stern of the ship which the Athenians send to Delos happened to have been crowned on the day before he was tried.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span><div class="speaker">ECHECRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What is this ship?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span><div class="speaker">PHAEDO</div><div class="sentence">  It is the ship in which, according to Athenian tradition, Theseus went to Crete when he took with him the fourteen youths, and was the saviour of them and of himself.</div><div class="sentence"> And they were said to have vowed to Apollo at the time, that if they were saved they would send a yearly mission to Delos.</div><div class="sentence"> Now this custom still continues, and the whole period of the voyage to and from Delos, beginning when the priest of Apollo crowns the stern of the ship, is a holy season, during which the city is not allowed to be polluted by public executions; and when the vessel is detained by contrary winds, the time spent in going and returning is very considerable.</div><div class="sentence"> As I was saying, the ship was crowned on the day before the trial, and this was the reason why Socrates lay in prison and was not put to death until long after he was condemned.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span><div class="speaker">ECHECRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What was the manner of his death, Phaedo?</div><div class="sentence"> What was said or done?</div><div class="sentence"> And which of his friends were with him?</div><div class="sentence"> Or did the authorities forbid them to be present—so that he had no friends near him when he died?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span><div class="speaker">PHAEDO</div><div class="sentence">  No; there were several of them with him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span><div class="speaker">ECHECRATES</div><div class="sentence">  If you have nothing to do, I wish that you would tell me what passed, as exactly as you can.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span><div class="speaker">PHAEDO</div><div class="sentence">  I have nothing at all to do, and will try to gratify your wish.</div><div class="sentence"> To be reminded of Socrates is always the greatest delight to me, whether I speak myself or hear another speak of him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span><div class="speaker">ECHECRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You will have listeners who are of the same mind with you, and I hope that you will be as exact as you can.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span><div class="speaker">PHAEDO</div><div class="sentence">  I had a singular feeling at being in his company.</div><div class="sentence"> For I could hardly believe that I was present at the death of a friend, and therefore I did not pity him, Echecrates; he died so fearlessly, and his words and bearing were so noble and gracious, that to me he appeared blessed.</div><div class="sentence"> I thought that in going to the other world he could not be without a divine call, and that he would be happy, if any man ever was, when he arrived there, and therefore I did not pity him as might have seemed natural at such an hour.</div><div class="sentence"> But I had not the pleasure which I usually feel in philosophical discourse (for philosophy was the theme of which we spoke).</div><div class="sentence"> I was pleased, but in the pleasure there was also a strange admixture of pain; for I reflected that he was soon to die, and this double feeling was shared by us all; we were laughing and weeping by turns, especially the excitable Apollodorus—you know the sort of man?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span><div class="speaker">ECHECRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span><div class="speaker">PHAEDO</div><div class="sentence">  He was quite beside himself; and I and all of us were greatly moved.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span><div class="speaker">ECHECRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Who were present?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span><div class="speaker">PHAEDO</div><div class="sentence">  Of native Athenians there were, besides Apollodorus, Critobulus and his father Crito, Hermogenes, Epigenes, Aeschines, Antisthenes; likewise Ctesippus of the deme of Paeania, Menexenus, and some others; Plato, if I am not mistaken, was ill.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span><div class="speaker">ECHECRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Were there any strangers?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span><div class="speaker">PHAEDO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, there were; Simmias the Theban, and Cebes, and Phaedondes; Euclid and Terpison, who came from Megara.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span><div class="speaker">ECHECRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And was Aristippus there, and Cleombrotus?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span><div class="speaker">PHAEDO</div><div class="sentence">  No, they were said to be in Aegina.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span><div class="speaker">ECHECRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Any one else?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span><div class="speaker">PHAEDO</div><div class="sentence">  I think that these were nearly all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span><div class="speaker">ECHECRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, and what did you talk about?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span><div class="speaker">PHAEDO</div><div class="sentence">  I will begin at the beginning, and endeavour to repeat the entire conversation.</div><div class="sentence"> On the previous days we had been in the habit of assembling early in the morning at the court in which the trial took place, and which is not far from the prison.</div><div class="sentence"> There we used to wait talking with one another until the opening of the doors (for they were not opened very early); then we went in and generally passed the day with Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> On the last morning we assembled sooner than usual, having heard on the day before when we quitted the prison in the evening that the sacred ship had come from Delos, and so we arranged to meet very early at the accustomed place.</div><div class="sentence"> On our arrival the jailer who answered the door, instead of admitting us, came out and told us to stay until he called us.</div><div class="sentence"> 'For the Eleven,' he said, 'are now with Socrates; they are taking off his chains, and giving orders that he is to die to-day.'</div><div class="sentence"> He soon returned and said that we might come in.</div><div class="sentence"> On entering we found Socrates just released from chains, and Xanthippe, whom you know, sitting by him, and holding his child in her arms.</div><div class="sentence"> When she saw us she uttered a cry and said, as women will:  'O Socrates, this is the last time that either you will converse with your friends, or they with you.'</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates turned to Crito and said:  'Crito, let some one take her home.'</div><div class="sentence"> Some of Crito's people accordingly led her away, crying out and beating herself.</div><div class="sentence"> And when she was gone, Socrates, sitting up on the couch, bent and rubbed his leg, saying, as he was rubbing:  How singular is the thing called pleasure, and how curiously related to pain, which might be thought to be the opposite of it; for they are never present to a man at the same instant, and yet he who pursues either is generally compelled to take the other; their bodies are two, but they are joined by a single head.</div><div class="sentence"> And I cannot help thinking that if Aesop had remembered them, he would have made a fable about God trying to reconcile their strife, and how, when he could not, he fastened their heads together; and this is the reason why when one comes the other follows, as I know by my own experience now, when after the pain in my leg which was caused by the chain pleasure appears to succeed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span> <div class="sentence">  Upon this Cebes said: I am glad, Socrates, that you have mentioned the name of Aesop.</div><div class="sentence"> For it reminds me of a question which has been asked by many, and was asked of me only the day before yesterday by Evenus the poet—he will be sure to ask it again, and therefore if you would like me to have an answer ready for him, you may as well tell me what I should say to him:—he wanted to know why you, who never before wrote a line of poetry, now that you are in prison are turning Aesop's fables into verse, and also composing that hymn in honour of Apollo.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span> <div class="sentence">  Tell him, Cebes, he replied, what is the truth—that I had no idea of rivalling him or his poems; to do so, as I knew, would be no easy task.</div><div class="sentence"> But I wanted to see whether I could purge away a scruple which I felt about the meaning of certain dreams.</div><div class="sentence"> In the course of my life I have often had intimations in dreams 'that I should compose music.'</div><div class="sentence"> The same dream came to me sometimes in one form, and sometimes in another, but always saying the same or nearly the same words: 'Cultivate and make music,' said the dream.</div><div class="sentence"> And hitherto I had imagined that this was only intended to exhort and encourage me in the study of philosophy, which has been the pursuit of my life, and is the noblest and best of music.</div><div class="sentence"> The dream was bidding me do what I was already doing, in the same way that the competitor in a race is bidden by the spectators to run when he is already running.</div><div class="sentence"> But I was not certain of this, for the dream might have meant music in the popular sense of the word, and being under sentence of death, and the festival giving me a respite, I thought that it would be safer for me to satisfy the scruple, and, in obedience to the dream, to compose a few verses before I departed.</div><div class="sentence"> And first I made a hymn in honour of the god of the festival, and then considering that a poet, if he is really to be a poet, should not only put together words, but should invent stories, and that I have no invention, I took some fables of Aesop, which I had ready at hand and which I knew—they were the first I came upon—and turned them into verse.</div><div class="sentence"> Tell this to Evenus, Cebes, and bid him be of good cheer; say that I would have him come after me if he be a wise man, and not tarry; and that to-day I am likely to be going, for the Athenians say that I must.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span> <div class="sentence">  Simmias said: What a message for such a man!</div><div class="sentence"> having been a frequent companion of his I should say that, as far as I know him, he will never take your advice unless he is obliged.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span> <div class="sentence">  Why, said Socrates,—is not Evenus a philosopher?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span> <div class="sentence">  I think that he is, said Simmias.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span> <div class="sentence">  Then he, or any man who has the spirit of philosophy, will be willing to die, but he will not take his own life, for that is held to be unlawful.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span> <div class="sentence">  Here he changed his position, and put his legs off the couch on to the ground, and during the rest of the conversation he remained sitting.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span> <div class="sentence">  Why do you say, enquired Cebes, that a man ought not to take his own life, but that the philosopher will be ready to follow the dying?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates replied: And have you, Cebes and Simmias, who are the disciples of Philolaus, never heard him speak of this?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, but his language was obscure, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span> <div class="sentence">  My words, too, are only an echo; but there is no reason why I should not repeat what I have heard: and indeed, as I am going to another place, it is very meet for me to be thinking and talking of the nature of the pilgrimage which I am about to make.</div><div class="sentence"> What can I do better in the interval between this and the setting of the sun?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span> <div class="sentence">  Then tell me, Socrates, why is suicide held to be unlawful?</div><div class="sentence"> as I have certainly heard Philolaus, about whom you were just now asking, affirm when he was staying with us at Thebes: and there are others who say the same, although I have never understood what was meant by any of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">040</span> <div class="sentence">  Do not lose heart, replied Socrates, and the day may come when you will understand.</div><div class="sentence"> I suppose that you wonder why, when other things which are evil may be good at certain times and to certain persons, death is to be the only exception, and why, when a man is better dead, he is not permitted to be his own benefactor, but must wait for the hand of another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true, said Cebes, laughing gently and speaking in his native Boeotian.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span> <div class="sentence">  I admit the appearance of inconsistency in what I am saying; but there may not be any real inconsistency after all.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a doctrine whispered in secret that man is a prisoner who has no right to open the door and run away; this is a great mystery which I do not quite understand.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet I too believe that the gods are our guardians, and that we are a possession of theirs.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you not agree?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">043</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, I quite agree, said Cebes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">044</span> <div class="sentence">  And if one of your own possessions, an ox or an ass, for example, took the liberty of putting himself out of the way when you had given no intimation of your wish that he should die, would you not be angry with him, and would you not punish him if you could?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly, replied Cebes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">046</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, if we look at the matter thus, there may be reason in saying that a man should wait, and not take his own life until God summons him, as he is now summoning me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">047</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates, said Cebes, there seems to be truth in what you say.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet how can you reconcile this seemingly true belief that God is our guardian and we his possessions, with the willingness to die which we were just now attributing to the philosopher?</div><div class="sentence"> That the wisest of men should be willing to leave a service in which they are ruled by the gods who are the best of rulers, is not reasonable; for surely no wise man thinks that when set at liberty he can take better care of himself than the gods take of him.</div><div class="sentence"> A fool may perhaps think so—he may argue that he had better run away from his master, not considering that his duty is to remain to the end, and not to run away from the good, and that there would be no sense in his running away.</div><div class="sentence"> The wise man will want to be ever with him who is better than himself.</div><div class="sentence"> Now this, Socrates, is the reverse of what was just now said; for upon this view the wise man should sorrow and the fool rejoice at passing out of life.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">048</span> <div class="sentence">  The earnestness of Cebes seemed to please Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> Here, said he, turning to us, is a man who is always inquiring, and is not so easily convinced by the first thing which he hears.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">049</span> <div class="sentence">  And certainly, added Simmias, the objection which he is now making does appear to me to have some force.</div><div class="sentence"> For what can be the meaning of a truly wise man wanting to fly away and lightly leave a master who is better than himself?</div><div class="sentence"> And I rather imagine that Cebes is referring to you; he thinks that you are too ready to leave us, and too ready to leave the gods whom you acknowledge to be our good masters.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">050</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, replied Socrates; there is reason in what you say.</div><div class="sentence"> And so you think that I ought to answer your indictment as if I were in a court?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span> <div class="sentence">  We should like you to do so, said Simmias.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span> <div class="sentence">  Then I must try to make a more successful defence before you than I did when before the judges.</div><div class="sentence"> For I am quite ready to admit, Simmias and Cebes, that I ought to be grieved at death, if I were not persuaded in the first place that I am going to other gods who are wise and good (of which I am as certain as I can be of any such matters), and secondly (though I am not so sure of this last) to men departed, better than those whom I leave behind; and therefore I do not grieve as I might have done, for I have good hope that there is yet something remaining for the dead, and as has been said of old, some far better thing for the good than for the evil.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span> <div class="sentence">  But do you mean to take away your thoughts with you, Socrates?</div><div class="sentence"> said Simmias.</div><div class="sentence"> Will you not impart them to us?—for they are a benefit in which we too are entitled to share.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover, if you succeed in convincing us, that will be an answer to the charge against yourself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span> <div class="sentence">  I will do my best, replied Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> But you must first let me hear what Crito wants; he has long been wishing to say something to me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span> <div class="sentence">  Only this, Socrates, replied Crito:—the attendant who is to give you the poison has been telling me, and he wants me to tell you, that you are not to talk much, talking, he says, increases heat, and this is apt to interfere with the action of the poison; persons who excite themselves are sometimes obliged to take a second or even a third dose.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, said Socrates, let him mind his business and be prepared to give the poison twice or even thrice if necessary; that is all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span> <div class="sentence">  I knew quite well what you would say, replied Crito; but I was obliged to satisfy him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span> <div class="sentence">  Never mind him, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span> <div class="sentence">  And now, O my judges, I desire to prove to you that the real philosopher has reason to be of good cheer when he is about to die, and that after death he may hope to obtain the greatest good in the other world.</div><div class="sentence"> And how this may be, Simmias and Cebes, I will endeavour to explain.</div><div class="sentence"> For I deem that the true votary of philosophy is likely to be misunderstood by other men; they do not perceive that he is always pursuing death and dying; and if this be so, and he has had the desire of death all his life long, why when his time comes should he repine at that which he has been always pursuing and desiring?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span> <div class="sentence">  Simmias said laughingly: Though not in a laughing humour, you have made me laugh, Socrates; for I cannot help thinking that the many when they hear your words will say how truly you have described philosophers, and our people at home will likewise say that the life which philosophers desire is in reality death, and that they have found them out to be deserving of the death which they desire.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span> <div class="sentence">  And they are right, Simmias, in thinking so, with the exception of the words 'they have found them out'; for they have not found out either what is the nature of that death which the true philosopher deserves, or how he deserves or desires death.</div><div class="sentence"> But enough of them:—let us discuss the matter among ourselves: Do we believe that there is such a thing as death?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span> <div class="sentence">  To be sure, replied Simmias.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span> <div class="sentence">  Is it not the separation of soul and body?</div><div class="sentence"> And to be dead is the completion of this; when the soul exists in herself, and is released from the body and the body is released from the soul, what is this but death?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span> <div class="sentence">  Just so, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span> <div class="sentence">  There is another question, which will probably throw light on our present inquiry if you and I can agree about it:—Ought the philosopher to care about the pleasures—if they are to be called pleasures—of eating and drinking?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not, answered Simmias.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span> <div class="sentence">  And what about the pleasures of love—should he care for them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span> <div class="sentence">  By no means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span> <div class="sentence">  And will he think much of the other ways of indulging the body, for example, the acquisition of costly raiment, or sandals, or other adornments of the body?</div><div class="sentence"> Instead of caring about them, does he not rather despise anything more than nature needs?</div><div class="sentence"> What do you say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span> <div class="sentence">  I should say that the true philosopher would despise them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span> <div class="sentence">  Would you not say that he is entirely concerned with the soul and not with the body?</div><div class="sentence"> He would like, as far as he can, to get away from the body and to turn to the soul.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span> <div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span> <div class="sentence">  In matters of this sort philosophers, above all other men, may be observed in every sort of way to dissever the soul from the communion of the body.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">074</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span> <div class="sentence">  Whereas, Simmias, the rest of the world are of opinion that to him who has no sense of pleasure and no part in bodily pleasure, life is not worth having; and that he who is indifferent about them is as good as dead.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">076</span> <div class="sentence">  That is also true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span> <div class="sentence">  What again shall we say of the actual acquirement of knowledge?—is the body, if invited to share in the enquiry, a hinderer or a helper?</div><div class="sentence"> I mean to say, have sight and hearing any truth in them?</div><div class="sentence"> Are they not, as the poets are always telling us, inaccurate witnesses?</div><div class="sentence"> and yet, if even they are inaccurate and indistinct, what is to be said of the other senses?—for you will allow that they are the best of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">078</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">079</span> <div class="sentence">  Then when does the soul attain truth?—for in attempting to consider anything in company with the body she is obviously deceived.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">081</span> <div class="sentence">  Then must not true existence be revealed to her in thought, if at all?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">082</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">083</span> <div class="sentence">  And thought is best when the mind is gathered into herself and none of these things trouble her—neither sounds nor sights nor pain nor any pleasure,—when she takes leave of the body, and has as little as possible to do with it, when she has no bodily sense or desire, but is aspiring after true being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">084</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">085</span> <div class="sentence">  And in this the philosopher dishonours the body; his soul runs away from his body and desires to be alone and by herself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">086</span> <div class="sentence">  That is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, but there is another thing, Simmias: Is there or is there not an absolute justice?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">088</span> <div class="sentence">  Assuredly there is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span> <div class="sentence">  And an absolute beauty and absolute good?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span> <div class="sentence">  But did you ever behold any of them with your eyes?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">093</span> <div class="sentence">  Or did you ever reach them with any other bodily sense?—and I speak not of these alone, but of absolute greatness, and health, and strength, and of the essence or true nature of everything.</div><div class="sentence"> Has the reality of them ever been perceived by you through the bodily organs?</div><div class="sentence"> or rather, is not the nearest approach to the knowledge of their several natures made by him who so orders his intellectual vision as to have the most exact conception of the essence of each thing which he considers?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span> <div class="sentence">  And he attains to the purest knowledge of them who goes to each with the mind alone, not introducing or intruding in the act of thought sight or any other sense together with reason, but with the very light of the mind in her own clearness searches into the very truth of each; he who has got rid, as far as he can, of eyes and ears and, so to speak, of the whole body, these being in his opinion distracting elements which when they infect the soul hinder her from acquiring truth and knowledge—who, if not he, is likely to attain the knowledge of true being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span> <div class="sentence">  What you say has a wonderful truth in it, Socrates, replied Simmias.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span> <div class="sentence">  And when real philosophers consider all these things, will they not be led to make a reflection which they will express in words something like the following?</div><div class="sentence"> 'Have we not found,' they will say, 'a path of thought which seems to bring us and our argument to the conclusion, that while we are in the body, and while the soul is infected with the evils of the body, our desire will not be satisfied?</div><div class="sentence"> and our desire is of the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> For the body is a source of endless trouble to us by reason of the mere requirement of food; and is liable also to diseases which overtake and impede us in the search after true being: it fills us full of loves, and lusts, and fears, and fancies of all kinds, and endless foolery, and in fact, as men say, takes away from us the power of thinking at all.</div><div class="sentence"> Whence come wars, and fightings, and factions?</div><div class="sentence"> whence but from the body and the lusts of the body?</div><div class="sentence"> wars are occasioned by the love of money, and money has to be acquired for the sake and in the service of the body; and by reason of all these impediments we have no time to give to philosophy; and, last and worst of all, even if we are at leisure and betake ourselves to some speculation, the body is always breaking in upon us, causing turmoil and confusion in our enquiries, and so amazing us that we are prevented from seeing the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> It has been proved to us by experience that if we would have pure knowledge of anything we must be quit of the body—the soul in herself must behold things in themselves: and then we shall attain the wisdom which we desire, and of which we say that we are lovers, not while we live, but after death; for if while in company with the body, the soul cannot have pure knowledge, one of two things follows—either knowledge is not to be attained at all, or, if at all, after death.</div><div class="sentence"> For then, and not till then, the soul will be parted from the body and exist in herself alone.</div><div class="sentence"> In this present life, I reckon that we make the nearest approach to knowledge when we have the least possible intercourse or communion with the body, and are not surfeited with the bodily nature, but keep ourselves pure until the hour when God himself is pleased to release us.</div><div class="sentence"> And thus having got rid of the foolishness of the body we shall be pure and hold converse with the pure, and know of ourselves the clear light everywhere, which is no other than the light of truth.'</div><div class="sentence"> For the impure are not permitted to approach the pure.</div><div class="sentence"> These are the sort of words, Simmias, which the true lovers of knowledge cannot help saying to one another, and thinking.</div><div class="sentence"> You would agree; would you not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">098</span> <div class="sentence">  Undoubtedly, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span> <div class="sentence">  But, O my friend, if this is true, there is great reason to hope that, going whither I go, when I have come to the end of my journey, I shall attain that which has been the pursuit of my life.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore I go on my way rejoicing, and not I only, but every other man who believes that his mind has been made ready and that he is in a manner purified.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">100</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly, replied Simmias.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span> <div class="sentence">  And what is purification but the separation of the soul from the body, as I was saying before; the habit of the soul gathering and collecting herself into herself from all sides out of the body; the dwelling in her own place alone, as in another life, so also in this, as far as she can;—the release of the soul from the chains of the body?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">103</span> <div class="sentence">  And this separation and release of the soul from the body is termed death?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span> <div class="sentence">  To be sure, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span> <div class="sentence">  And the true philosophers, and they only, are ever seeking to release the soul.</div><div class="sentence"> Is not the separation and release of the soul from the body their especial study?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span> <div class="sentence">  That is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span> <div class="sentence">  And, as I was saying at first, there would be a ridiculous contradiction in men studying to live as nearly as they can in a state of death, and yet repining when it comes upon them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">109</span> <div class="sentence">  And the true philosophers, Simmias, are always occupied in the practice of dying, wherefore also to them least of all men is death terrible.</div><div class="sentence"> Look at the matter thus:—if they have been in every way the enemies of the body, and are wanting to be alone with the soul, when this desire of theirs is granted, how inconsistent would they be if they trembled and repined, instead of rejoicing at their departure to that place where, when they arrive, they hope to gain that which in life they desired—and this was wisdom—and at the same time to be rid of the company of their enemy.</div><div class="sentence"> Many a man has been willing to go to the world below animated by the hope of seeing there an earthly love, or wife, or son, and conversing with them.</div><div class="sentence"> And will he who is a true lover of wisdom, and is strongly persuaded in like manner that only in the world below he can worthily enjoy her, still repine at death?</div><div class="sentence"> Will he not depart with joy?</div><div class="sentence"> Surely he will, O my friend, if he be a true philosopher.</div><div class="sentence"> For he will have a firm conviction that there and there only, he can find wisdom in her purity.</div><div class="sentence"> And if this be true, he would be very absurd, as I was saying, if he were afraid of death.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span> <div class="sentence">  He would, indeed, replied Simmias.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">111</span> <div class="sentence">  And when you see a man who is repining at the approach of death, is not his reluctance a sufficient proof that he is not a lover of wisdom, but a lover of the body, and probably at the same time a lover of either money or power, or both?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">112</span> <div class="sentence">  Quite so, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">113</span> <div class="sentence">  And is not courage, Simmias, a quality which is specially characteristic of the philosopher?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">114</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">115</span> <div class="sentence">  There is temperance again, which even by the vulgar is supposed to consist in the control and regulation of the passions, and in the sense of superiority to them—is not temperance a virtue belonging to those only who despise the body, and who pass their lives in philosophy?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">116</span> <div class="sentence">  Most assuredly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">117</span> <div class="sentence">  For the courage and temperance of other men, if you will consider them, are really a contradiction.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">118</span> <div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">119</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, he said, you are aware that death is regarded by men in general as a great evil.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">120</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">121</span> <div class="sentence">  And do not courageous men face death because they are afraid of yet greater evils?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">122</span> <div class="sentence">  That is quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">123</span> <div class="sentence">  Then all but the philosophers are courageous only from fear, and because they are afraid; and yet that a man should be courageous from fear, and because he is a coward, is surely a strange thing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">124</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">125</span> <div class="sentence">  And are not the temperate exactly in the same case?</div><div class="sentence"> They are temperate because they are intemperate—which might seem to be a contradiction, but is nevertheless the sort of thing which happens with this foolish temperance.</div><div class="sentence"> For there are pleasures which they are afraid of losing; and in their desire to keep them, they abstain from some pleasures, because they are overcome by others; and although to be conquered by pleasure is called by men intemperance, to them the conquest of pleasure consists in being conquered by pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> And that is what I mean by saying that, in a sense, they are made temperate through intemperance.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">126</span> <div class="sentence">  Such appears to be the case.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">127</span> <div class="sentence">  Yet the exchange of one fear or pleasure or pain for another fear or pleasure or pain, and of the greater for the less, as if they were coins, is not the exchange of virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> O my blessed Simmias, is there not one true coin for which all things ought to be exchanged?—and that is wisdom; and only in exchange for this, and in company with this, is anything truly bought or sold, whether courage or temperance or justice.</div><div class="sentence"> And is not all true virtue the companion of wisdom, no matter what fears or pleasures or other similar goods or evils may or may not attend her?</div><div class="sentence"> But the virtue which is made up of these goods, when they are severed from wisdom and exchanged with one another, is a shadow of virtue only, nor is there any freedom or health or truth in her; but in the true exchange there is a purging away of all these things, and temperance, and justice, and courage, and wisdom herself are the purgation of them.</div><div class="sentence"> The founders of the mysteries would appear to have had a real meaning, and were not talking nonsense when they intimated in a figure long ago that he who passes unsanctified and uninitiated into the world below will lie in a slough, but that he who arrives there after initiation and purification will dwell with the gods.</div><div class="sentence"> For 'many,' as they say in the mysteries, 'are the thyrsus-bearers, but few are the mystics,'—meaning, as I interpret the words, 'the true philosophers.'</div><div class="sentence"> In the number of whom, during my whole life, I have been seeking, according to my ability, to find a place;—whether I have sought in a right way or not, and whether I have succeeded or not, I shall truly know in a little while, if God will, when I myself arrive in the other world—such is my belief.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore I maintain that I am right, Simmias and Cebes, in not grieving or repining at parting from you and my masters in this world, for I believe that I shall equally find good masters and friends in another world.</div><div class="sentence"> But most men do not believe this saying; if then I succeed in convincing you by my defence better than I did the Athenian judges, it will be well.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">128</span> <div class="sentence">  Cebes answered: I agree, Socrates, in the greater part of what you say.</div><div class="sentence"> But in what concerns the soul, men are apt to be incredulous; they fear that when she has left the body her place may be nowhere, and that on the very day of death she may perish and come to an end—immediately on her release from the body, issuing forth dispersed like smoke or air and in her flight vanishing away into nothingness.</div><div class="sentence"> If she could only be collected into herself after she has obtained release from the evils of which you are speaking, there would be good reason to hope, Socrates, that what you say is true.</div><div class="sentence"> But surely it requires a great deal of argument and many proofs to show that when the man is dead his soul yet exists, and has any force or intelligence.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">129</span> <div class="sentence">  True, Cebes, said Socrates; and shall I suggest that we converse a little of the probabilities of these things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">130</span> <div class="sentence">  I am sure, said Cebes, that I should greatly like to know your opinion about them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">131</span> <div class="sentence">  I reckon, said Socrates, that no one who heard me now, not even if he were one of my old enemies, the Comic poets, could accuse me of idle talking about matters in which I have no concern:—If you please, then, we will proceed with the inquiry.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">132</span> <div class="sentence">  Suppose we consider the question whether the souls of men after death are or are not in the world below.</div><div class="sentence"> There comes into my mind an ancient doctrine which affirms that they go from hence into the other world, and returning hither, are born again from the dead.</div><div class="sentence"> Now if it be true that the living come from the dead, then our souls must exist in the other world, for if not, how could they have been born again?</div><div class="sentence"> And this would be conclusive, if there were any real evidence that the living are only born from the dead; but if this is not so, then other arguments will have to be adduced.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">133</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true, replied Cebes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">134</span> <div class="sentence">  Then let us consider the whole question, not in relation to man only, but in relation to animals generally, and to plants, and to everything of which there is generation, and the proof will be easier.</div><div class="sentence"> Are not all things which have opposites generated out of their opposites?</div><div class="sentence"> I mean such things as good and evil, just and unjust—and there are innumerable other opposites which are generated out of opposites.</div><div class="sentence"> And I want to show that in all opposites there is of necessity a similar alternation; I mean to say, for example, that anything which becomes greater must become greater after being less.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">135</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">136</span> <div class="sentence">  And that which becomes less must have been once greater and then have become less.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">137</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">138</span> <div class="sentence">  And the weaker is generated from the stronger, and the swifter from the slower.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">139</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">140</span> <div class="sentence">  And the worse is from the better, and the more just is from the more unjust.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">141</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">142</span> <div class="sentence">  And is this true of all opposites?</div><div class="sentence"> and are we convinced that all of them are generated out of opposites?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">143</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">144</span> <div class="sentence">  And in this universal opposition of all things, are there not also two intermediate processes which are ever going on, from one to the other opposite, and back again; where there is a greater and a less there is also an intermediate process of increase and diminution, and that which grows is said to wax, and that which decays to wane?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">145</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">146</span> <div class="sentence">  And there are many other processes, such as division and composition, cooling and heating, which equally involve a passage into and out of one another.</div><div class="sentence"> And this necessarily holds of all opposites, even though not always expressed in words—they are really generated out of one another, and there is a passing or process from one to the other of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">147</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">148</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, and is there not an opposite of life, as sleep is the opposite of waking?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">149</span> <div class="sentence">  True, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">150</span> <div class="sentence">  And what is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">151</span> <div class="sentence">  Death, he answered.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">152</span> <div class="sentence">  And these, if they are opposites, are generated the one from the other, and have there their two intermediate processes also?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">153</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">154</span> <div class="sentence">  Now, said Socrates, I will analyze one of the two pairs of opposites which I have mentioned to you, and also its intermediate processes, and you shall analyze the other to me.</div><div class="sentence"> One of them I term sleep, the other waking.</div><div class="sentence"> The state of sleep is opposed to the state of waking, and out of sleeping waking is generated, and out of waking, sleeping; and the process of generation is in the one case falling asleep, and in the other waking up.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you agree?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">155</span> <div class="sentence">  I entirely agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">156</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, suppose that you analyze life and death to me in the same manner.</div><div class="sentence"> Is not death opposed to life?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">157</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">158</span> <div class="sentence">  And they are generated one from the other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">159</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">160</span> <div class="sentence">  What is generated from the living?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">161</span> <div class="sentence">  The dead.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">162</span> <div class="sentence">  And what from the dead?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">163</span> <div class="sentence">  I can only say in answer—the living.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">164</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the living, whether things or persons, Cebes, are generated from the dead?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">165</span> <div class="sentence">  That is clear, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">166</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the inference is that our souls exist in the world below?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">167</span> <div class="sentence">  That is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">168</span> <div class="sentence">  And one of the two processes or generations is visible—for surely the act of dying is visible?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">169</span> <div class="sentence">  Surely, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">170</span> <div class="sentence">  What then is to be the result?</div><div class="sentence"> Shall we exclude the opposite process?</div><div class="sentence"> And shall we suppose nature to walk on one leg only?</div><div class="sentence"> Must we not rather assign to death some corresponding process of generation?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">171</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">172</span> <div class="sentence">  And what is that process?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">173</span> <div class="sentence">  Return to life.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">174</span> <div class="sentence">  And return to life, if there be such a thing, is the birth of the dead into the world of the living?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">175</span> <div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">176</span> <div class="sentence">  Then here is a new way by which we arrive at the conclusion that the living come from the dead, just as the dead come from the living; and this, if true, affords a most certain proof that the souls of the dead exist in some place out of which they come again.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">177</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates, he said; the conclusion seems to flow necessarily out of our previous admissions.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">178</span> <div class="sentence">  And that these admissions were not unfair, Cebes, he said, may be shown, I think, as follows: If generation were in a straight line only, and there were no compensation or circle in nature, no turn or return of elements into their opposites, then you know that all things would at last have the same form and pass into the same state, and there would be no more generation of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">179</span> <div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div><div class="sentence"> he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">180</span> <div class="sentence">  A simple thing enough, which I will illustrate by the case of sleep, he replied.</div><div class="sentence"> You know that if there were no alternation of sleeping and waking, the tale of the sleeping Endymion would in the end have no meaning, because all other things would be asleep, too, and he would not be distinguishable from the rest.</div><div class="sentence"> Or if there were composition only, and no division of substances, then the chaos of Anaxagoras would come again.</div><div class="sentence"> And in like manner, my dear Cebes, if all things which partook of life were to die, and after they were dead remained in the form of death, and did not come to life again, all would at last die, and nothing would be alive—what other result could there be?</div><div class="sentence"> For if the living spring from any other things, and they too die, must not all things at last be swallowed up in death?</div><div class="sentence"> (But compare Republic.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">181</span> <div class="sentence">  There is no escape, Socrates, said Cebes; and to me your argument seems to be absolutely true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">182</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, he said, Cebes, it is and must be so, in my opinion; and we have not been deluded in making these admissions; but I am confident that there truly is such a thing as living again, and that the living spring from the dead, and that the souls of the dead are in existence, and that the good souls have a better portion than the evil.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">183</span> <div class="sentence">  Cebes added: Your favorite doctrine, Socrates, that knowledge is simply recollection, if true, also necessarily implies a previous time in which we have learned that which we now recollect.</div><div class="sentence"> But this would be impossible unless our soul had been in some place before existing in the form of man; here then is another proof of the soul's immortality.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">184</span> <div class="sentence">  But tell me, Cebes, said Simmias, interposing, what arguments are urged in favour of this doctrine of recollection.</div><div class="sentence"> I am not very sure at the moment that I remember them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">185</span> <div class="sentence">  One excellent proof, said Cebes, is afforded by questions.</div><div class="sentence"> If you put a question to a person in a right way, he will give a true answer of himself, but how could he do this unless there were knowledge and right reason already in him?</div><div class="sentence"> And this is most clearly shown when he is taken to a diagram or to anything of that sort.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Meno.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">186</span> <div class="sentence">  But if, said Socrates, you are still incredulous, Simmias, I would ask you whether you may not agree with me when you look at the matter in another way;—I mean, if you are still incredulous as to whether knowledge is recollection.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">187</span> <div class="sentence">  Incredulous, I am not, said Simmias; but I want to have this doctrine of recollection brought to my own recollection, and, from what Cebes has said, I am beginning to recollect and be convinced; but I should still like to hear what you were going to say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">188</span> <div class="sentence">  This is what I would say, he replied:—We should agree, if I am not mistaken, that what a man recollects he must have known at some previous time.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">189</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">190</span> <div class="sentence">  And what is the nature of this knowledge or recollection?</div><div class="sentence"> I mean to ask, Whether a person who, having seen or heard or in any way perceived anything, knows not only that, but has a conception of something else which is the subject, not of the same but of some other kind of knowledge, may not be fairly said to recollect that of which he has the conception?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">191</span> <div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">192</span> <div class="sentence">  I mean what I may illustrate by the following instance:—The knowledge of a lyre is not the same as the knowledge of a man?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">193</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">194</span> <div class="sentence">  And yet what is the feeling of lovers when they recognize a lyre, or a garment, or anything else which the beloved has been in the habit of using?</div><div class="sentence"> Do not they, from knowing the lyre, form in the mind's eye an image of the youth to whom the lyre belongs?</div><div class="sentence"> And this is recollection.</div><div class="sentence"> In like manner any one who sees Simmias may remember Cebes; and there are endless examples of the same thing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">195</span> <div class="sentence">  Endless, indeed, replied Simmias.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">196</span> <div class="sentence">  And recollection is most commonly a process of recovering that which has been already forgotten through time and inattention.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">197</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">198</span> <div class="sentence">  Well; and may you not also from seeing the picture of a horse or a lyre remember a man?</div><div class="sentence"> and from the picture of Simmias, you may be led to remember Cebes?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">199</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">200</span> <div class="sentence">  Or you may also be led to the recollection of Simmias himself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">201</span> <div class="sentence">  Quite so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">202</span> <div class="sentence">  And in all these cases, the recollection may be derived from things either like or unlike?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">203</span> <div class="sentence">  It may be.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">204</span> <div class="sentence">  And when the recollection is derived from like things, then another consideration is sure to arise, which is—whether the likeness in any degree falls short or not of that which is recollected?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">205</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">206</span> <div class="sentence">  And shall we proceed a step further, and affirm that there is such a thing as equality, not of one piece of wood or stone with another, but that, over and above this, there is absolute equality?</div><div class="sentence"> Shall we say so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">207</span> <div class="sentence">  Say so, yes, replied Simmias, and swear to it, with all the confidence in life.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">208</span> <div class="sentence">  And do we know the nature of this absolute essence?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">209</span> <div class="sentence">  To be sure, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">210</span> <div class="sentence">  And whence did we obtain our knowledge?</div><div class="sentence"> Did we not see equalities of material things, such as pieces of wood and stones, and gather from them the idea of an equality which is different from them?</div><div class="sentence"> For you will acknowledge that there is a difference.</div><div class="sentence"> Or look at the matter in another way:—Do not the same pieces of wood or stone appear at one time equal, and at another time unequal?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">211</span> <div class="sentence">  That is certain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">212</span> <div class="sentence">  But are real equals ever unequal?</div><div class="sentence"> or is the idea of equality the same as of inequality?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">213</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">214</span> <div class="sentence">  Then these (so-called) equals are not the same with the idea of equality?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">215</span> <div class="sentence">  I should say, clearly not, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">216</span> <div class="sentence">  And yet from these equals, although differing from the idea of equality, you conceived and attained that idea?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">217</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">218</span> <div class="sentence">  Which might be like, or might be unlike them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">219</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">220</span> <div class="sentence">  But that makes no difference; whenever from seeing one thing you conceived another, whether like or unlike, there must surely have been an act of recollection?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">221</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">222</span> <div class="sentence">  But what would you say of equal portions of wood and stone, or other material equals?</div><div class="sentence"> and what is the impression produced by them?</div><div class="sentence"> Are they equals in the same sense in which absolute equality is equal?</div><div class="sentence"> or do they fall short of this perfect equality in a measure?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">223</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, he said, in a very great measure too.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">224</span> <div class="sentence">  And must we not allow, that when I or any one, looking at any object, observes that the thing which he sees aims at being some other thing, but falls short of, and cannot be, that other thing, but is inferior, he who makes this observation must have had a previous knowledge of that to which the other, although similar, was inferior?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">225</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">226</span> <div class="sentence">  And has not this been our own case in the matter of equals and of absolute equality?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">227</span> <div class="sentence">  Precisely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">228</span> <div class="sentence">  Then we must have known equality previously to the time when we first saw the material equals, and reflected that all these apparent equals strive to attain absolute equality, but fall short of it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">229</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">230</span> <div class="sentence">  And we recognize also that this absolute equality has only been known, and can only be known, through the medium of sight or touch, or of some other of the senses, which are all alike in this respect?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">231</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates, as far as the argument is concerned, one of them is the same as the other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">232</span> <div class="sentence">  From the senses then is derived the knowledge that all sensible things aim at an absolute equality of which they fall short?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">233</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">234</span> <div class="sentence">  Then before we began to see or hear or perceive in any way, we must have had a knowledge of absolute equality, or we could not have referred to that standard the equals which are derived from the senses?—for to that they all aspire, and of that they fall short.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">235</span> <div class="sentence">  No other inference can be drawn from the previous statements.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">236</span> <div class="sentence">  And did we not see and hear and have the use of our other senses as soon as we were born?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">237</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">238</span> <div class="sentence">  Then we must have acquired the knowledge of equality at some previous time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">239</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">240</span> <div class="sentence">  That is to say, before we were born, I suppose?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">241</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">242</span> <div class="sentence">  And if we acquired this knowledge before we were born, and were born having the use of it, then we also knew before we were born and at the instant of birth not only the equal or the greater or the less, but all other ideas; for we are not speaking only of equality, but of beauty, goodness, justice, holiness, and of all which we stamp with the name of essence in the dialectical process, both when we ask and when we answer questions.</div><div class="sentence"> Of all this we may certainly affirm that we acquired the knowledge before birth?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">243</span> <div class="sentence">  We may.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">244</span> <div class="sentence">  But if, after having acquired, we have not forgotten what in each case we acquired, then we must always have come into life having knowledge, and shall always continue to know as long as life lasts—for knowing is the acquiring and retaining knowledge and not forgetting.</div><div class="sentence"> Is not forgetting, Simmias, just the losing of knowledge?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">245</span> <div class="sentence">  Quite true, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">246</span> <div class="sentence">  But if the knowledge which we acquired before birth was lost by us at birth, and if afterwards by the use of the senses we recovered what we previously knew, will not the process which we call learning be a recovering of the knowledge which is natural to us, and may not this be rightly termed recollection?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">247</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">248</span> <div class="sentence">  So much is clear—that when we perceive something, either by the help of sight, or hearing, or some other sense, from that perception we are able to obtain a notion of some other thing like or unlike which is associated with it but has been forgotten.</div><div class="sentence"> Whence, as I was saying, one of two alternatives follows:—either we had this knowledge at birth, and continued to know through life; or, after birth, those who are said to learn only remember, and learning is simply recollection.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">249</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, that is quite true, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">250</span> <div class="sentence">  And which alternative, Simmias, do you prefer?</div><div class="sentence"> Had we the knowledge at our birth, or did we recollect the things which we knew previously to our birth?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">251</span> <div class="sentence">  I cannot decide at the moment.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">252</span> <div class="sentence">  At any rate you can decide whether he who has knowledge will or will not be able to render an account of his knowledge?</div><div class="sentence"> What do you say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">253</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly, he will.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">254</span> <div class="sentence">  But do you think that every man is able to give an account of these very matters about which we are speaking?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">255</span> <div class="sentence">  Would that they could, Socrates, but I rather fear that to-morrow, at this time, there will no longer be any one alive who is able to give an account of them such as ought to be given.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">256</span> <div class="sentence">  Then you are not of opinion, Simmias, that all men know these things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">257</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">258</span> <div class="sentence">  They are in process of recollecting that which they learned before?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">259</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">260</span> <div class="sentence">  But when did our souls acquire this knowledge?—not since we were born as men?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">261</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">262</span> <div class="sentence">  And therefore, previously?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">263</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">264</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, Simmias, our souls must also have existed without bodies before they were in the form of man, and must have had intelligence.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">265</span> <div class="sentence">  Unless indeed you suppose, Socrates, that these notions are given us at the very moment of birth; for this is the only time which remains.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">266</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, my friend, but if so, when do we lose them?</div><div class="sentence"> for they are not in us when we are born—that is admitted.</div><div class="sentence"> Do we lose them at the moment of receiving them, or if not at what other time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">267</span> <div class="sentence">  No, Socrates, I perceive that I was unconsciously talking nonsense.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">268</span> <div class="sentence">  Then may we not say, Simmias, that if, as we are always repeating, there is an absolute beauty, and goodness, and an absolute essence of all things; and if to this, which is now discovered to have existed in our former state, we refer all our sensations, and with this compare them, finding these ideas to be pre-existent and our inborn possession—then our souls must have had a prior existence, but if not, there would be no force in the argument?</div><div class="sentence"> There is the same proof that these ideas must have existed before we were born, as that our souls existed before we were born; and if not the ideas, then not the souls.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">269</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates; I am convinced that there is precisely the same necessity for the one as for the other; and the argument retreats successfully to the position that the existence of the soul before birth cannot be separated from the existence of the essence of which you speak.</div><div class="sentence"> For there is nothing which to my mind is so patent as that beauty, goodness, and the other notions of which you were just now speaking, have a most real and absolute existence; and I am satisfied with the proof.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">270</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, but is Cebes equally satisfied?</div><div class="sentence"> for I must convince him too.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">271</span> <div class="sentence">  I think, said Simmias, that Cebes is satisfied: although he is the most incredulous of mortals, yet I believe that he is sufficiently convinced of the existence of the soul before birth.</div><div class="sentence"> But that after death the soul will continue to exist is not yet proven even to my own satisfaction.</div><div class="sentence"> I cannot get rid of the feeling of the many to which Cebes was referring—the feeling that when the man dies the soul will be dispersed, and that this may be the extinction of her.</div><div class="sentence"> For admitting that she may have been born elsewhere, and framed out of other elements, and was in existence before entering the human body, why after having entered in and gone out again may she not herself be destroyed and come to an end?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">272</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true, Simmias, said Cebes; about half of what was required has been proven; to wit, that our souls existed before we were born:—that the soul will exist after death as well as before birth is the other half of which the proof is still wanting, and has to be supplied; when that is given the demonstration will be complete.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">273</span> <div class="sentence">  But that proof, Simmias and Cebes, has been already given, said Socrates, if you put the two arguments together—I mean this and the former one, in which we admitted that everything living is born of the dead.</div><div class="sentence"> For if the soul exists before birth, and in coming to life and being born can be born only from death and dying, must she not after death continue to exist, since she has to be born again?—Surely the proof which you desire has been already furnished.</div><div class="sentence"> Still I suspect that you and Simmias would be glad to probe the argument further.</div><div class="sentence"> Like children, you are haunted with a fear that when the soul leaves the body, the wind may really blow her away and scatter her; especially if a man should happen to die in a great storm and not when the sky is calm.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">274</span> <div class="sentence">  Cebes answered with a smile: Then, Socrates, you must argue us out of our fears—and yet, strictly speaking, they are not our fears, but there is a child within us to whom death is a sort of hobgoblin; him too we must persuade not to be afraid when he is alone in the dark.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">275</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates said: Let the voice of the charmer be applied daily until you have charmed away the fear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">276</span> <div class="sentence">  And where shall we find a good charmer of our fears, Socrates, when you are gone?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">277</span> <div class="sentence">  Hellas, he replied, is a large place, Cebes, and has many good men, and there are barbarous races not a few: seek for him among them all, far and wide, sparing neither pains nor money; for there is no better way of spending your money.</div><div class="sentence"> And you must seek among yourselves too; for you will not find others better able to make the search.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">278</span> <div class="sentence">  The search, replied Cebes, shall certainly be made.</div><div class="sentence"> And now, if you please, let us return to the point of the argument at which we digressed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">279</span> <div class="sentence">  By all means, replied Socrates; what else should I please?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">280</span> <div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">281</span> <div class="sentence">  Must we not, said Socrates, ask ourselves what that is which, as we imagine, is liable to be scattered, and about which we fear?</div><div class="sentence"> and what again is that about which we have no fear?</div><div class="sentence"> And then we may proceed further to enquire whether that which suffers dispersion is or is not of the nature of soul—our hopes and fears as to our own souls will turn upon the answers to these questions.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">282</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">283</span> <div class="sentence">  Now the compound or composite may be supposed to be naturally capable, as of being compounded, so also of being dissolved; but that which is uncompounded, and that only, must be, if anything is, indissoluble.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">284</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes; I should imagine so, said Cebes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">285</span> <div class="sentence">  And the uncompounded may be assumed to be the same and unchanging, whereas the compound is always changing and never the same.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">286</span> <div class="sentence">  I agree, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">287</span> <div class="sentence">  Then now let us return to the previous discussion.</div><div class="sentence"> Is that idea or essence, which in the dialectical process we define as essence or true existence—whether essence of equality, beauty, or anything else—are these essences, I say, liable at times to some degree of change?</div><div class="sentence"> or are they each of them always what they are, having the same simple self-existent and unchanging forms, not admitting of variation at all, or in any way, or at any time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">288</span> <div class="sentence">  They must be always the same, Socrates, replied Cebes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">289</span> <div class="sentence">  And what would you say of the many beautiful—whether men or horses or garments or any other things which are named by the same names and may be called equal or beautiful,—are they all unchanging and the same always, or quite the reverse?</div><div class="sentence"> May they not rather be described as almost always changing and hardly ever the same, either with themselves or with one another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">290</span> <div class="sentence">  The latter, replied Cebes; they are always in a state of change.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">291</span> <div class="sentence">  And these you can touch and see and perceive with the senses, but the unchanging things you can only perceive with the mind—they are invisible and are not seen?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">292</span> <div class="sentence">  That is very true, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">293</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, then, added Socrates, let us suppose that there are two sorts of existences—one seen, the other unseen.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">294</span> <div class="sentence">  Let us suppose them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">295</span> <div class="sentence">  The seen is the changing, and the unseen is the unchanging?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">296</span> <div class="sentence">  That may be also supposed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">297</span> <div class="sentence">  And, further, is not one part of us body, another part soul?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">298</span> <div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">299</span> <div class="sentence">  And to which class is the body more alike and akin?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">303</span> <div class="sentence">  And what we mean by 'seen' and 'not seen' is that which is or is not visible to the eye of man?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">310</span> <div class="sentence">  That follows necessarily, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">311</span> <div class="sentence">  And were we not saying long ago that the soul when using the body as an instrument of perception, that is to say, when using the sense of sight or hearing or some other sense (for the meaning of perceiving through the body is perceiving through the senses)—were we not saying that the soul too is then dragged by the body into the region of the changeable, and wanders and is confused; the world spins round her, and she is like a drunkard, when she touches change?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">312</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">313</span> <div class="sentence">  But when returning into herself she reflects, then she passes into the other world, the region of purity, and eternity, and immortality, and unchangeableness, which are her kindred, and with them she ever lives, when she is by herself and is not let or hindered; then she ceases from her erring ways, and being in communion with the unchanging is unchanging.</div><div class="sentence"> And this state of the soul is called wisdom?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">315</span> <div class="sentence">  And to which class is the soul more nearly alike and akin, as far as may be inferred from this argument, as well as from the preceding one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">316</span> <div class="sentence">  I think, Socrates, that, in the opinion of every one who follows the argument, the soul will be infinitely more like the unchangeable—even the most stupid person will not deny that.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">319</span> <div class="sentence">  Yet once more consider the matter in another light: When the soul and the body are united, then nature orders the soul to rule and govern, and the body to obey and serve.</div><div class="sentence"> Now which of these two functions is akin to the divine?</div><div class="sentence"> and which to the mortal?</div><div class="sentence"> Does not the divine appear to you to be that which naturally orders and rules, and the mortal to be that which is subject and servant?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">323</span> <div class="sentence">  Then reflect, Cebes: of all which has been said is not this the conclusion?—that the soul is in the very likeness of the divine, and immortal, and intellectual, and uniform, and indissoluble, and unchangeable; and that the body is in the very likeness of the human, and mortal, and unintellectual, and multiform, and dissoluble, and changeable.</div><div class="sentence"> Can this, my dear Cebes, be denied?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">327</span> <div class="sentence">  And do you further observe, that after a man is dead, the body, or visible part of him, which is lying in the visible world, and is called a corpse, and would naturally be dissolved and decomposed and dissipated, is not dissolved or decomposed at once, but may remain for a for some time, nay even for a long time, if the constitution be sound at the time of death, and the season of the year favourable?</div><div class="sentence"> For the body when shrunk and embalmed, as the manner is in Egypt, may remain almost entire through infinite ages; and even in decay, there are still some portions, such as the bones and ligaments, which are practically indestructible:—Do you agree?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">333</span> <div class="sentence">  But the soul which has been polluted, and is impure at the time of her departure, and is the companion and servant of the body always, and is in love with and fascinated by the body and by the desires and pleasures of the body, until she is led to believe that the truth only exists in a bodily form, which a man may touch and see and taste, and use for the purposes of his lusts,—the soul, I mean, accustomed to hate and fear and avoid the intellectual principle, which to the bodily eye is dark and invisible, and can be attained only by philosophy;—do you suppose that such a soul will depart pure and unalloyed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">334</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible, he replied.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">337</span> <div class="sentence">  And this corporeal element, my friend, is heavy and weighty and earthy, and is that element of sight by which a soul is depressed and dragged down again into the visible world, because she is afraid of the invisible and of the world below—prowling about tombs and sepulchres, near which, as they tell us, are seen certain ghostly apparitions of souls which have not departed pure, but are cloyed with sight and therefore visible.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">340</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, that is very likely, Cebes; and these must be the souls, not of the good, but of the evil, which are compelled to wander about such places in payment of the penalty of their former evil way of life; and they continue to wander until through the craving after the corporeal which never leaves them, they are imprisoned finally in another body.</div><div class="sentence"> And they may be supposed to find their prisons in the same natures which they have had in their former lives.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">349</span> <div class="sentence">  Why are they the happiest?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">350</span> <div class="sentence">  Because they may be expected to pass into some gentle and social kind which is like their own, such as bees or wasps or ants, or back again into the form of man, and just and moderate men may be supposed to spring from them.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">352</span> <div class="sentence">  No one who has not studied philosophy and who is not entirely pure at the time of his departure is allowed to enter the company of the Gods, but the lover of knowledge only.</div><div class="sentence"> And this is the reason, Simmias and Cebes, why the true votaries of philosophy abstain from all fleshly lusts, and hold out against them and refuse to give themselves up to them,—not because they fear poverty or the ruin of their families, like the lovers of money, and the world in general; nor like the lovers of power and honour, because they dread the dishonour or disgrace of evil deeds.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">353</span> <div class="sentence">  No, Socrates, that would not become them, said Cebes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">354</span> <div class="sentence">  No indeed, he replied; and therefore they who have any care of their own souls, and do not merely live moulding and fashioning the body, say farewell to all this; they will not walk in the ways of the blind: and when philosophy offers them purification and release from evil, they feel that they ought not to resist her influence, and whither she leads they turn and follow.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">355</span> <div class="sentence">  What do you mean, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">356</span> <div class="sentence">  I will tell you, he said.</div><div class="sentence"> The lovers of knowledge are conscious that the soul was simply fastened and glued to the body—until philosophy received her, she could only view real existence through the bars of a prison, not in and through herself; she was wallowing in the mire of every sort of ignorance; and by reason of lust had become the principal accomplice in her own captivity.</div><div class="sentence"> This was her original state; and then, as I was saying, and as the lovers of knowledge are well aware, philosophy, seeing how terrible was her confinement, of which she was to herself the cause, received and gently comforted her and sought to release her, pointing out that the eye and the ear and the other senses are full of deception, and persuading her to retire from them, and abstain from all but the necessary use of them, and be gathered up and collected into herself, bidding her trust in herself and her own pure apprehension of pure existence, and to mistrust whatever comes to her through other channels and is subject to variation; for such things are visible and tangible, but what she sees in her own nature is intelligible and invisible.</div><div class="sentence"> And the soul of the true philosopher thinks that she ought not to resist this deliverance, and therefore abstains from pleasures and desires and pains and fears, as far as she is able; reflecting that when a man has great joys or sorrows or fears or desires, he suffers from them, not merely the sort of evil which might be anticipated—as for example, the loss of his health or property which he has sacrificed to his lusts—but an evil greater far, which is the greatest and worst of all evils, and one of which he never thinks.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">357</span> <div class="sentence">  What is it, Socrates?</div><div class="sentence"> said Cebes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">358</span> <div class="sentence">  The evil is that when the feeling of pleasure or pain is most intense, every soul of man imagines the objects of this intense feeling to be then plainest and truest: but this is not so, they are really the things of sight.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">359</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">360</span> <div class="sentence">  And is not this the state in which the soul is most enthralled by the body?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">361</span> <div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">362</span> <div class="sentence">  Why, because each pleasure and pain is a sort of nail which nails and rivets the soul to the body, until she becomes like the body, and believes that to be true which the body affirms to be true; and from agreeing with the body and having the same delights she is obliged to have the same habits and haunts, and is not likely ever to be pure at her departure to the world below, but is always infected by the body; and so she sinks into another body and there germinates and grows, and has therefore no part in the communion of the divine and pure and simple.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">363</span> <div class="sentence">  Most true, Socrates, answered Cebes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">364</span> <div class="sentence">  And this, Cebes, is the reason why the true lovers of knowledge are temperate and brave; and not for the reason which the world gives.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">365</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">366</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not!</div><div class="sentence"> The soul of a philosopher will reason in quite another way; she will not ask philosophy to release her in order that when released she may deliver herself up again to the thraldom of pleasures and pains, doing a work only to be undone again, weaving instead of unweaving her Penelope's web.</div><div class="sentence"> But she will calm passion, and follow reason, and dwell in the contemplation of her, beholding the true and divine (which is not matter of opinion), and thence deriving nourishment.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus she seeks to live while she lives, and after death she hopes to go to her own kindred and to that which is like her, and to be freed from human ills.</div><div class="sentence"> Never fear, Simmias and Cebes, that a soul which has been thus nurtured and has had these pursuits, will at her departure from the body be scattered and blown away by the winds and be nowhere and nothing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">367</span> <div class="sentence">  When Socrates had done speaking, for a considerable time there was silence; he himself appeared to be meditating, as most of us were, on what had been said; only Cebes and Simmias spoke a few words to one another.</div><div class="sentence"> And Socrates observing them asked what they thought of the argument, and whether there was anything wanting?</div><div class="sentence"> For, said he, there are many points still open to suspicion and attack, if any one were disposed to sift the matter thoroughly.</div><div class="sentence"> Should you be considering some other matter I say no more, but if you are still in doubt do not hesitate to say exactly what you think, and let us have anything better which you can suggest; and if you think that I can be of any use, allow me to help you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">368</span> <div class="sentence">  Simmias said: I must confess, Socrates, that doubts did arise in our minds, and each of us was urging and inciting the other to put the question which we wanted to have answered and which neither of us liked to ask, fearing that our importunity might be troublesome under present at such a time.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">369</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates replied with a smile: O Simmias, what are you saying?</div><div class="sentence"> I am not very likely to persuade other men that I do not regard my present situation as a misfortune, if I cannot even persuade you that I am no worse off now than at any other time in my life.</div><div class="sentence"> Will you not allow that I have as much of the spirit of prophecy in me as the swans?</div><div class="sentence"> For they, when they perceive that they must die, having sung all their life long, do then sing more lustily than ever, rejoicing in the thought that they are about to go away to the god whose ministers they are.</div><div class="sentence"> But men, because they are themselves afraid of death, slanderously affirm of the swans that they sing a lament at the last, not considering that no bird sings when cold, or hungry, or in pain, not even the nightingale, nor the swallow, nor yet the hoopoe; which are said indeed to tune a lay of sorrow, although I do not believe this to be true of them any more than of the swans.</div><div class="sentence"> But because they are sacred to Apollo, they have the gift of prophecy, and anticipate the good things of another world, wherefore they sing and rejoice in that day more than they ever did before.</div><div class="sentence"> And I too, believing myself to be the consecrated servant of the same God, and the fellow-servant of the swans, and thinking that I have received from my master gifts of prophecy which are not inferior to theirs, would not go out of life less merrily than the swans.</div><div class="sentence"> Never mind then, if this be your only objection, but speak and ask anything which you like, while the eleven magistrates of Athens allow.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">370</span> <div class="sentence">  Very good, Socrates, said Simmias; then I will tell you my difficulty, and Cebes will tell you his.</div><div class="sentence"> I feel myself, (and I daresay that you have the same feeling), how hard or rather impossible is the attainment of any certainty about questions such as these in the present life.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet I should deem him a coward who did not prove what is said about them to the uttermost, or whose heart failed him before he had examined them on every side.</div><div class="sentence"> For he should persevere until he has achieved one of two things: either he should discover, or be taught the truth about them; or, if this be impossible, I would have him take the best and most irrefragable of human theories, and let this be the raft upon which he sails through life—not without risk, as I admit, if he cannot find some word of God which will more surely and safely carry him.</div><div class="sentence"> And now, as you bid me, I will venture to question you, and then I shall not have to reproach myself hereafter with not having said at the time what I think.</div><div class="sentence"> For when I consider the matter, either alone or with Cebes, the argument does certainly appear to me, Socrates, to be not sufficient.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">371</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates answered: I dare say, my friend, that you may be right, but I should like to know in what respect the argument is insufficient.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">372</span> <div class="sentence">  In this respect, replied Simmias:—Suppose a person to use the same argument about harmony and the lyre—might he not say that harmony is a thing invisible, incorporeal, perfect, divine, existing in the lyre which is harmonized, but that the lyre and the strings are matter and material, composite, earthy, and akin to mortality?</div><div class="sentence"> And when some one breaks the lyre, or cuts and rends the strings, then he who takes this view would argue as you do, and on the same analogy, that the harmony survives and has not perished—you cannot imagine, he would say, that the lyre without the strings, and the broken strings themselves which are mortal remain, and yet that the harmony, which is of heavenly and immortal nature and kindred, has perished—perished before the mortal.</div><div class="sentence"> The harmony must still be somewhere, and the wood and strings will decay before anything can happen to that.</div><div class="sentence"> The thought, Socrates, must have occurred to your own mind that such is our conception of the soul; and that when the body is in a manner strung and held together by the elements of hot and cold, wet and dry, then the soul is the harmony or due proportionate admixture of them.</div><div class="sentence"> But if so, whenever the strings of the body are unduly loosened or overstrained through disease or other injury, then the soul, though most divine, like other harmonies of music or of works of art, of course perishes at once, although the material remains of the body may last for a considerable time, until they are either decayed or burnt.</div><div class="sentence"> And if any one maintains that the soul, being the harmony of the elements of the body, is first to perish in that which is called death, how shall we answer him?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">373</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates looked fixedly at us as his manner was, and said with a smile: Simmias has reason on his side; and why does not some one of you who is better able than myself answer him?</div><div class="sentence"> for there is force in his attack upon me.</div><div class="sentence"> But perhaps, before we answer him, we had better also hear what Cebes has to say that we may gain time for reflection, and when they have both spoken, we may either assent to them, if there is truth in what they say, or if not, we will maintain our position.</div><div class="sentence"> Please to tell me then, Cebes, he said, what was the difficulty which troubled you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">374</span> <div class="sentence">  Cebes said: I will tell you.</div><div class="sentence"> My feeling is that the argument is where it was, and open to the same objections which were urged before; for I am ready to admit that the existence of the soul before entering into the bodily form has been very ingeniously, and, if I may say so, quite sufficiently proven; but the existence of the soul after death is still, in my judgment, unproven.</div><div class="sentence"> Now my objection is not the same as that of Simmias; for I am not disposed to deny that the soul is stronger and more lasting than the body, being of opinion that in all such respects the soul very far excels the body.</div><div class="sentence"> Well, then, says the argument to me, why do you remain unconvinced?—When you see that the weaker continues in existence after the man is dead, will you not admit that the more lasting must also survive during the same period of time?</div><div class="sentence"> Now I will ask you to consider whether the objection, which, like Simmias, I will express in a figure, is of any weight.</div><div class="sentence"> The analogy which I will adduce is that of an old weaver, who dies, and after his death somebody says:—He is not dead, he must be alive;—see, there is the coat which he himself wove and wore, and which remains whole and undecayed.</div><div class="sentence"> And then he proceeds to ask of some one who is incredulous, whether a man lasts longer, or the coat which is in use and wear; and when he is answered that a man lasts far longer, thinks that he has thus certainly demonstrated the survival of the man, who is the more lasting, because the less lasting remains.</div><div class="sentence"> But that, Simmias, as I would beg you to remark, is a mistake; any one can see that he who talks thus is talking nonsense.</div><div class="sentence"> For the truth is, that the weaver aforesaid, having woven and worn many such coats, outlived several of them, and was outlived by the last; but a man is not therefore proved to be slighter and weaker than a coat.</div><div class="sentence"> Now the relation of the body to the soul may be expressed in a similar figure; and any one may very fairly say in like manner that the soul is lasting, and the body weak and shortlived in comparison.</div><div class="sentence"> He may argue in like manner that every soul wears out many bodies, especially if a man live many years.</div><div class="sentence"> While he is alive the body deliquesces and decays, and the soul always weaves another garment and repairs the waste.</div><div class="sentence"> But of course, whenever the soul perishes, she must have on her last garment, and this will survive her; and then at length, when the soul is dead, the body will show its native weakness, and quickly decompose and pass away.</div><div class="sentence"> I would therefore rather not rely on the argument from superior strength to prove the continued existence of the soul after death.</div><div class="sentence"> For granting even more than you affirm to be possible, and acknowledging not only that the soul existed before birth, but also that the souls of some exist, and will continue to exist after death, and will be born and die again and again, and that there is a natural strength in the soul which will hold out and be born many times—nevertheless, we may be still inclined to think that she will weary in the labours of successive births, and may at last succumb in one of her deaths and utterly perish; and this death and dissolution of the body which brings destruction to the soul may be unknown to any of us, for no one of us can have had any experience of it: and if so, then I maintain that he who is confident about death has but a foolish confidence, unless he is able to prove that the soul is altogether immortal and imperishable.</div><div class="sentence"> But if he cannot prove the soul's immortality, he who is about to die will always have reason to fear that when the body is disunited, the soul also may utterly perish.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">375</span> <div class="sentence">  All of us, as we afterwards remarked to one another, had an unpleasant feeling at hearing what they said.</div><div class="sentence"> When we had been so firmly convinced before, now to have our faith shaken seemed to introduce a confusion and uncertainty, not only into the previous argument, but into any future one; either we were incapable of forming a judgment, or there were no grounds of belief.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">376</span><div class="speaker">ECHECRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There I feel with you—by heaven I do, Phaedo, and when you were speaking, I was beginning to ask myself the same question:  What argument can I ever trust again?</div><div class="sentence"> For what could be more convincing than the argument of Socrates, which has now fallen into discredit?</div><div class="sentence"> That the soul is a harmony is a doctrine which has always had a wonderful attraction for me, and, when mentioned, came back to me at once, as my own original conviction.</div><div class="sentence"> And now I must begin again and find another argument which will assure me that when the man is dead the soul survives.</div><div class="sentence"> Tell me, I implore you, how did Socrates proceed?</div><div class="sentence"> Did he appear to share the unpleasant feeling which you mention?</div><div class="sentence"> or did he calmly meet the attack?</div><div class="sentence"> And did he answer forcibly or feebly?</div><div class="sentence"> Narrate what passed as exactly as you can.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">377</span><div class="speaker">PHAEDO</div><div class="sentence">  Often, Echecrates, I have wondered at Socrates, but never more than on that occasion.</div><div class="sentence"> That he should be able to answer was nothing, but what astonished me was, first, the gentle and pleasant and approving manner in which he received the words of the young men, and then his quick sense of the wound which had been inflicted by the argument, and the readiness with which he healed it.</div><div class="sentence"> He might be compared to a general rallying his defeated and broken army, urging them to accompany him and return to the field of argument.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">380</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates, I suppose that they will, I replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">381</span> <div class="sentence">  Not so, if you will take my advice.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">382</span> <div class="sentence">  What shall I do with them?</div><div class="sentence"> I said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">383</span> <div class="sentence">  To-day, he replied, and not to-morrow, if this argument dies and we cannot bring it to life again, you and I will both shave our locks; and if I were you, and the argument got away from me, and I could not hold my ground against Simmias and Cebes, I would myself take an oath, like the Argives, not to wear hair any more until I had renewed the conflict and defeated them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">384</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, I said, but Heracles himself is said not to be a match for two.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">385</span> <div class="sentence">  Summon me then, he said, and I will be your Iolaus until the sun goes down.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">386</span> <div class="sentence">  I summon you rather, I rejoined, not as Heracles summoning Iolaus, but as Iolaus might summon Heracles.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">387</span> <div class="sentence">  That will do as well, he said.</div><div class="sentence"> But first let us take care that we avoid a danger.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">388</span> <div class="sentence">  Of what nature?</div><div class="sentence"> I said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">389</span> <div class="sentence">  Lest we become misologists, he replied, no worse thing can happen to a man than this.</div><div class="sentence"> For as there are misanthropists or haters of men, there are also misologists or haters of ideas, and both spring from the same cause, which is ignorance of the world.</div><div class="sentence"> Misanthropy arises out of the too great confidence of inexperience;—you trust a man and think him altogether true and sound and faithful, and then in a little while he turns out to be false and knavish; and then another and another, and when this has happened several times to a man, especially when it happens among those whom he deems to be his own most trusted and familiar friends, and he has often quarreled with them, he at last hates all men, and believes that no one has any good in him at all.</div><div class="sentence"> You must have observed this trait of character?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">390</span> <div class="sentence">  I have.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">391</span> <div class="sentence">  And is not the feeling discreditable?</div><div class="sentence"> Is it not obvious that such an one having to deal with other men, was clearly without any experience of human nature; for experience would have taught him the true state of the case, that few are the good and few the evil, and that the great majority are in the interval between them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">392</span> <div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div><div class="sentence"> I said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">393</span> <div class="sentence">  I mean, he replied, as you might say of the very large and very small, that nothing is more uncommon than a very large or very small man; and this applies generally to all extremes, whether of great and small, or swift and slow, or fair and foul, or black and white: and whether the instances you select be men or dogs or anything else, few are the extremes, but many are in the mean between them.</div><div class="sentence"> Did you never observe this?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">394</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, I said, I have.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">395</span> <div class="sentence">  And do you not imagine, he said, that if there were a competition in evil, the worst would be found to be very few?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">396</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, that is very likely, I said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">397</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, that is very likely, he replied; although in this respect arguments are unlike men—there I was led on by you to say more than I had intended; but the point of comparison was, that when a simple man who has no skill in dialectics believes an argument to be true which he afterwards imagines to be false, whether really false or not, and then another and another, he has no longer any faith left, and great disputers, as you know, come to think at last that they have grown to be the wisest of mankind; for they alone perceive the utter unsoundness and instability of all arguments, or indeed, of all things, which, like the currents in the Euripus, are going up and down in never-ceasing ebb and flow.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">398</span> <div class="sentence">  That is quite true, I said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">399</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, Phaedo, he replied, and how melancholy, if there be such a thing as truth or certainty or possibility of knowledge—that a man should have lighted upon some argument or other which at first seemed true and then turned out to be false, and instead of blaming himself and his own want of wit, because he is annoyed, should at last be too glad to transfer the blame from himself to arguments in general: and for ever afterwards should hate and revile them, and lose truth and the knowledge of realities.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">400</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, indeed, I said; that is very melancholy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">401</span> <div class="sentence">  Let us then, in the first place, he said, be careful of allowing or of admitting into our souls the notion that there is no health or soundness in any arguments at all.</div><div class="sentence"> Rather say that we have not yet attained to soundness in ourselves, and that we must struggle manfully and do our best to gain health of mind—you and all other men having regard to the whole of your future life, and I myself in the prospect of death.</div><div class="sentence"> For at this moment I am sensible that I have not the temper of a philosopher; like the vulgar, I am only a partisan.</div><div class="sentence"> Now the partisan, when he is engaged in a dispute, cares nothing about the rights of the question, but is anxious only to convince his hearers of his own assertions.</div><div class="sentence"> And the difference between him and me at the present moment is merely this—that whereas he seeks to convince his hearers that what he says is true, I am rather seeking to convince myself; to convince my hearers is a secondary matter with me.</div><div class="sentence"> And do but see how much I gain by the argument.</div><div class="sentence"> For if what I say is true, then I do well to be persuaded of the truth, but if there be nothing after death, still, during the short time that remains, I shall not distress my friends with lamentations, and my ignorance will not last, but will die with me, and therefore no harm will be done.</div><div class="sentence"> This is the state of mind, Simmias and Cebes, in which I approach the argument.</div><div class="sentence"> And I would ask you to be thinking of the truth and not of Socrates: agree with me, if I seem to you to be speaking the truth; or if not, withstand me might and main, that I may not deceive you as well as myself in my enthusiasm, and like the bee, leave my sting in you before I die.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">402</span> <div class="sentence">  And now let us proceed, he said.</div><div class="sentence"> And first of all let me be sure that I have in my mind what you were saying.</div><div class="sentence"> Simmias, if I remember rightly, has fears and misgivings whether the soul, although a fairer and diviner thing than the body, being as she is in the form of harmony, may not perish first.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, Cebes appeared to grant that the soul was more lasting than the body, but he said that no one could know whether the soul, after having worn out many bodies, might not perish herself and leave her last body behind her; and that this is death, which is the destruction not of the body but of the soul, for in the body the work of destruction is ever going on.</div><div class="sentence"> Are not these, Simmias and Cebes, the points which we have to consider?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">403</span> <div class="sentence">  They both agreed to this statement of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">404</span> <div class="sentence">  He proceeded: And did you deny the force of the whole preceding argument, or of a part only?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">405</span> <div class="sentence">  Of a part only, they replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">406</span> <div class="sentence">  And what did you think, he said, of that part of the argument in which we said that knowledge was recollection, and hence inferred that the soul must have previously existed somewhere else before she was enclosed in the body?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">407</span> <div class="sentence">  Cebes said that he had been wonderfully impressed by that part of the argument, and that his conviction remained absolutely unshaken.</div><div class="sentence"> Simmias agreed, and added that he himself could hardly imagine the possibility of his ever thinking differently.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">408</span> <div class="sentence">  But, rejoined Socrates, you will have to think differently, my Theban friend, if you still maintain that harmony is a compound, and that the soul is a harmony which is made out of strings set in the frame of the body; for you will surely never allow yourself to say that a harmony is prior to the elements which compose it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">409</span> <div class="sentence">  Never, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">410</span> <div class="sentence">  But do you not see that this is what you imply when you say that the soul existed before she took the form and body of man, and was made up of elements which as yet had no existence?</div><div class="sentence"> For harmony is not like the soul, as you suppose; but first the lyre, and the strings, and the sounds exist in a state of discord, and then harmony is made last of all, and perishes first.</div><div class="sentence"> And how can such a notion of the soul as this agree with the other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">411</span> <div class="sentence">  Not at all, replied Simmias.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">412</span> <div class="sentence">  And yet, he said, there surely ought to be harmony in a discourse of which harmony is the theme.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">413</span> <div class="sentence">  There ought, replied Simmias.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">414</span> <div class="sentence">  But there is no harmony, he said, in the two propositions that knowledge is recollection, and that the soul is a harmony.</div><div class="sentence"> Which of them will you retain?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">415</span> <div class="sentence">  I think, he replied, that I have a much stronger faith, Socrates, in the first of the two, which has been fully demonstrated to me, than in the latter, which has not been demonstrated at all, but rests only on probable and plausible grounds; and is therefore believed by the many.</div><div class="sentence"> I know too well that these arguments from probabilities are impostors, and unless great caution is observed in the use of them, they are apt to be deceptive—in geometry, and in other things too.</div><div class="sentence"> But the doctrine of knowledge and recollection has been proven to me on trustworthy grounds; and the proof was that the soul must have existed before she came into the body, because to her belongs the essence of which the very name implies existence.</div><div class="sentence"> Having, as I am convinced, rightly accepted this conclusion, and on sufficient grounds, I must, as I suppose, cease to argue or allow others to argue that the soul is a harmony.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">416</span> <div class="sentence">  Let me put the matter, Simmias, he said, in another point of view: Do you imagine that a harmony or any other composition can be in a state other than that of the elements, out of which it is compounded?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">417</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">418</span> <div class="sentence">  Or do or suffer anything other than they do or suffer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">419</span> <div class="sentence">  He agreed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">420</span> <div class="sentence">  Then a harmony does not, properly speaking, lead the parts or elements which make up the harmony, but only follows them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">421</span> <div class="sentence">  He assented.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">422</span> <div class="sentence">  For harmony cannot possibly have any motion, or sound, or other quality which is opposed to its parts.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">423</span> <div class="sentence">  That would be impossible, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">424</span> <div class="sentence">  And does not the nature of every harmony depend upon the manner in which the elements are harmonized?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">425</span> <div class="sentence">  I do not understand you, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">426</span> <div class="sentence">  I mean to say that a harmony admits of degrees, and is more of a harmony, and more completely a harmony, when more truly and fully harmonized, to any extent which is possible; and less of a harmony, and less completely a harmony, when less truly and fully harmonized.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">427</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">428</span> <div class="sentence">  But does the soul admit of degrees?</div><div class="sentence"> or is one soul in the very least degree more or less, or more or less completely, a soul than another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">429</span> <div class="sentence">  Not in the least.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">430</span> <div class="sentence">  Yet surely of two souls, one is said to have intelligence and virtue, and to be good, and the other to have folly and vice, and to be an evil soul: and this is said truly?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">431</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, truly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">432</span> <div class="sentence">  But what will those who maintain the soul to be a harmony say of this presence of virtue and vice in the soul?—will they say that here is another harmony, and another discord, and that the virtuous soul is harmonized, and herself being a harmony has another harmony within her, and that the vicious soul is inharmonical and has no harmony within her?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">433</span> <div class="sentence">  I cannot tell, replied Simmias; but I suppose that something of the sort would be asserted by those who say that the soul is a harmony.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">434</span> <div class="sentence">  And we have already admitted that no soul is more a soul than another; which is equivalent to admitting that harmony is not more or less harmony, or more or less completely a harmony?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">435</span> <div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">436</span> <div class="sentence">  And that which is not more or less a harmony is not more or less harmonized?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">437</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">438</span> <div class="sentence">  And that which is not more or less harmonized cannot have more or less of harmony, but only an equal harmony?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">439</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, an equal harmony.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">440</span> <div class="sentence">  Then one soul not being more or less absolutely a soul than another, is not more or less harmonized?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">441</span> <div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">442</span> <div class="sentence">  And therefore has neither more nor less of discord, nor yet of harmony?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">443</span> <div class="sentence">  She has not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">444</span> <div class="sentence">  And having neither more nor less of harmony or of discord, one soul has no more vice or virtue than another, if vice be discord and virtue harmony?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">445</span> <div class="sentence">  Not at all more.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">446</span> <div class="sentence">  Or speaking more correctly, Simmias, the soul, if she is a harmony, will never have any vice; because a harmony, being absolutely a harmony, has no part in the inharmonical.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">447</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">448</span> <div class="sentence">  And therefore a soul which is absolutely a soul has no vice?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">449</span> <div class="sentence">  How can she have, if the previous argument holds?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">450</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, if all souls are equally by their nature souls, all souls of all living creatures will be equally good?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">451</span> <div class="sentence">  I agree with you, Socrates, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">452</span> <div class="sentence">  And can all this be true, think you?</div><div class="sentence"> he said; for these are the consequences which seem to follow from the assumption that the soul is a harmony?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">453</span> <div class="sentence">  It cannot be true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">454</span> <div class="sentence">  Once more, he said, what ruler is there of the elements of human nature other than the soul, and especially the wise soul?</div><div class="sentence"> Do you know of any?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">455</span> <div class="sentence">  Indeed, I do not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">456</span> <div class="sentence">  And is the soul in agreement with the affections of the body?</div><div class="sentence"> or is she at variance with them?</div><div class="sentence"> For example, when the body is hot and thirsty, does not the soul incline us against drinking?</div><div class="sentence"> and when the body is hungry, against eating?</div><div class="sentence"> And this is only one instance out of ten thousand of the opposition of the soul to the things of the body.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">457</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">458</span> <div class="sentence">  But we have already acknowledged that the soul, being a harmony, can never utter a note at variance with the tensions and relaxations and vibrations and other affections of the strings out of which she is composed; she can only follow, she cannot lead them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">459</span> <div class="sentence">  It must be so, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">460</span> <div class="sentence">  And yet do we not now discover the soul to be doing the exact opposite—leading the elements of which she is believed to be composed; almost always opposing and coercing them in all sorts of ways throughout life, sometimes more violently with the pains of medicine and gymnastic; then again more gently; now threatening, now admonishing the desires, passions, fears, as if talking to a thing which is not herself, as Homer in the Odyssee represents Odysseus doing in the words—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">461</span> <div class="sentence">  'He beat his breast, and thus reproached his heart: Endure, my heart; far worse hast thou endured!'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">462</span> <div class="sentence">  Do you think that Homer wrote this under the idea that the soul is a harmony capable of being led by the affections of the body, and not rather of a nature which should lead and master them—herself a far diviner thing than any harmony?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">463</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates, I quite think so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">464</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, my friend, we can never be right in saying that the soul is a harmony, for we should contradict the divine Homer, and contradict ourselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">465</span> <div class="sentence">  True, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">466</span> <div class="sentence">  Thus much, said Socrates, of Harmonia, your Theban goddess, who has graciously yielded to us; but what shall I say, Cebes, to her husband Cadmus, and how shall I make peace with him?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">467</span> <div class="sentence">  I think that you will discover a way of propitiating him, said Cebes; I am sure that you have put the argument with Harmonia in a manner that I could never have expected.</div><div class="sentence"> For when Simmias was mentioning his difficulty, I quite imagined that no answer could be given to him, and therefore I was surprised at finding that his argument could not sustain the first onset of yours, and not impossibly the other, whom you call Cadmus, may share a similar fate.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">468</span> <div class="sentence">  Nay, my good friend, said Socrates, let us not boast, lest some evil eye should put to flight the word which I am about to speak.</div><div class="sentence"> That, however, may be left in the hands of those above, while I draw near in Homeric fashion, and try the mettle of your words.</div><div class="sentence"> Here lies the point:—You want to have it proven to you that the soul is imperishable and immortal, and the philosopher who is confident in death appears to you to have but a vain and foolish confidence, if he believes that he will fare better in the world below than one who has led another sort of life, unless he can prove this; and you say that the demonstration of the strength and divinity of the soul, and of her existence prior to our becoming men, does not necessarily imply her immortality.</div><div class="sentence"> Admitting the soul to be longlived, and to have known and done much in a former state, still she is not on that account immortal; and her entrance into the human form may be a sort of disease which is the beginning of dissolution, and may at last, after the toils of life are over, end in that which is called death.</div><div class="sentence"> And whether the soul enters into the body once only or many times, does not, as you say, make any difference in the fears of individuals.</div><div class="sentence"> For any man, who is not devoid of sense, must fear, if he has no knowledge and can give no account of the soul's immortality.</div><div class="sentence"> This, or something like this, I suspect to be your notion, Cebes; and I designedly recur to it in order that nothing may escape us, and that you may, if you wish, add or subtract anything.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">469</span> <div class="sentence">  But, said Cebes, as far as I see at present, I have nothing to add or subtract: I mean what you say that I mean.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">470</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates paused awhile, and seemed to be absorbed in reflection.</div><div class="sentence"> At length he said: You are raising a tremendous question, Cebes, involving the whole nature of generation and corruption, about which, if you like, I will give you my own experience; and if anything which I say is likely to avail towards the solution of your difficulty you may make use of it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">471</span> <div class="sentence">  I should very much like, said Cebes, to hear what you have to say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">472</span> <div class="sentence">  Then I will tell you, said Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> When I was young, Cebes, I had a prodigious desire to know that department of philosophy which is called the investigation of nature; to know the causes of things, and why a thing is and is created or destroyed appeared to me to be a lofty profession; and I was always agitating myself with the consideration of questions such as these:—Is the growth of animals the result of some decay which the hot and cold principle contracts, as some have said?</div><div class="sentence"> Is the blood the element with which we think, or the air, or the fire?</div><div class="sentence"> or perhaps nothing of the kind—but the brain may be the originating power of the perceptions of hearing and sight and smell, and memory and opinion may come from them, and science may be based on memory and opinion when they have attained fixity.</div><div class="sentence"> And then I went on to examine the corruption of them, and then to the things of heaven and earth, and at last I concluded myself to be utterly and absolutely incapable of these enquiries, as I will satisfactorily prove to you.</div><div class="sentence"> For I was fascinated by them to such a degree that my eyes grew blind to things which I had seemed to myself, and also to others, to know quite well; I forgot what I had before thought self-evident truths; e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> such a fact as that the growth of man is the result of eating and drinking; for when by the digestion of food flesh is added to flesh and bone to bone, and whenever there is an aggregation of congenial elements, the lesser bulk becomes larger and the small man great.</div><div class="sentence"> Was not that a reasonable notion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">473</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, said Cebes, I think so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">474</span> <div class="sentence">  Well; but let me tell you something more.</div><div class="sentence"> There was a time when I thought that I understood the meaning of greater and less pretty well; and when I saw a great man standing by a little one, I fancied that one was taller than the other by a head; or one horse would appear to be greater than another horse: and still more clearly did I seem to perceive that ten is two more than eight, and that two cubits are more than one, because two is the double of one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">475</span> <div class="sentence">  And what is now your notion of such matters?</div><div class="sentence"> said Cebes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">476</span> <div class="sentence">  I should be far enough from imagining, he replied, that I knew the cause of any of them, by heaven I should; for I cannot satisfy myself that, when one is added to one, the one to which the addition is made becomes two, or that the two units added together make two by reason of the addition.</div><div class="sentence"> I cannot understand how, when separated from the other, each of them was one and not two, and now, when they are brought together, the mere juxtaposition or meeting of them should be the cause of their becoming two: neither can I understand how the division of one is the way to make two; for then a different cause would produce the same effect,—as in the former instance the addition and juxtaposition of one to one was the cause of two, in this the separation and subtraction of one from the other would be the cause.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor am I any longer satisfied that I understand the reason why one or anything else is either generated or destroyed or is at all, but I have in my mind some confused notion of a new method, and can never admit the other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">477</span> <div class="sentence">  Then I heard some one reading, as he said, from a book of Anaxagoras, that mind was the disposer and cause of all, and I was delighted at this notion, which appeared quite admirable, and I said to myself: If mind is the disposer, mind will dispose all for the best, and put each particular in the best place; and I argued that if any one desired to find out the cause of the generation or destruction or existence of anything, he must find out what state of being or doing or suffering was best for that thing, and therefore a man had only to consider the best for himself and others, and then he would also know the worse, since the same science comprehended both.</div><div class="sentence"> And I rejoiced to think that I had found in Anaxagoras a teacher of the causes of existence such as I desired, and I imagined that he would tell me first whether the earth is flat or round; and whichever was true, he would proceed to explain the cause and the necessity of this being so, and then he would teach me the nature of the best and show that this was best; and if he said that the earth was in the centre, he would further explain that this position was the best, and I should be satisfied with the explanation given, and not want any other sort of cause.</div><div class="sentence"> And I thought that I would then go on and ask him about the sun and moon and stars, and that he would explain to me their comparative swiftness, and their returnings and various states, active and passive, and how all of them were for the best.</div><div class="sentence"> For I could not imagine that when he spoke of mind as the disposer of them, he would give any other account of their being as they are, except that this was best; and I thought that when he had explained to me in detail the cause of each and the cause of all, he would go on to explain to me what was best for each and what was good for all.</div><div class="sentence"> These hopes I would not have sold for a large sum of money, and I seized the books and read them as fast as I could in my eagerness to know the better and the worse.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">478</span> <div class="sentence">  What expectations I had formed, and how grievously was I disappointed!</div><div class="sentence"> As I proceeded, I found my philosopher altogether forsaking mind or any other principle of order, but having recourse to air, and ether, and water, and other eccentricities.</div><div class="sentence"> I might compare him to a person who began by maintaining generally that mind is the cause of the actions of Socrates, but who, when he endeavoured to explain the causes of my several actions in detail, went on to show that I sit here because my body is made up of bones and muscles; and the bones, as he would say, are hard and have joints which divide them, and the muscles are elastic, and they cover the bones, which have also a covering or environment of flesh and skin which contains them; and as the bones are lifted at their joints by the contraction or relaxation of the muscles, I am able to bend my limbs, and this is why I am sitting here in a curved posture—that is what he would say, and he would have a similar explanation of my talking to you, which he would attribute to sound, and air, and hearing, and he would assign ten thousand other causes of the same sort, forgetting to mention the true cause, which is, that the Athenians have thought fit to condemn me, and accordingly I have thought it better and more right to remain here and undergo my sentence; for I am inclined to think that these muscles and bones of mine would have gone off long ago to Megara or Boeotia—by the dog they would, if they had been moved only by their own idea of what was best, and if I had not chosen the better and nobler part, instead of playing truant and running away, of enduring any punishment which the state inflicts.</div><div class="sentence"> There is surely a strange confusion of causes and conditions in all this.</div><div class="sentence"> It may be said, indeed, that without bones and muscles and the other parts of the body I cannot execute my purposes.</div><div class="sentence"> But to say that I do as I do because of them, and that this is the way in which mind acts, and not from the choice of the best, is a very careless and idle mode of speaking.</div><div class="sentence"> I wonder that they cannot distinguish the cause from the condition, which the many, feeling about in the dark, are always mistaking and misnaming.</div><div class="sentence"> And thus one man makes a vortex all round and steadies the earth by the heaven; another gives the air as a support to the earth, which is a sort of broad trough.</div><div class="sentence"> Any power which in arranging them as they are arranges them for the best never enters into their minds; and instead of finding any superior strength in it, they rather expect to discover another Atlas of the world who is stronger and more everlasting and more containing than the good;—of the obligatory and containing power of the good they think nothing; and yet this is the principle which I would fain learn if any one would teach me.</div><div class="sentence"> But as I have failed either to discover myself, or to learn of any one else, the nature of the best, I will exhibit to you, if you like, what I have found to be the second best mode of enquiring into the cause.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">479</span> <div class="sentence">  I should very much like to hear, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">480</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates proceeded:—I thought that as I had failed in the contemplation of true existence, I ought to be careful that I did not lose the eye of my soul; as people may injure their bodily eye by observing and gazing on the sun during an eclipse, unless they take the precaution of only looking at the image reflected in the water, or in some similar medium.</div><div class="sentence"> So in my own case, I was afraid that my soul might be blinded altogether if I looked at things with my eyes or tried to apprehend them by the help of the senses.</div><div class="sentence"> And I thought that I had better have recourse to the world of mind and seek there the truth of existence.</div><div class="sentence"> I dare say that the simile is not perfect—for I am very far from admitting that he who contemplates existences through the medium of thought, sees them only 'through a glass darkly,' any more than he who considers them in action and operation.</div><div class="sentence"> However, this was the method which I adopted: I first assumed some principle which I judged to be the strongest, and then I affirmed as true whatever seemed to agree with this, whether relating to the cause or to anything else; and that which disagreed I regarded as untrue.</div><div class="sentence"> But I should like to explain my meaning more clearly, as I do not think that you as yet understand me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">481</span> <div class="sentence">  No indeed, replied Cebes, not very well.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">482</span> <div class="sentence">  There is nothing new, he said, in what I am about to tell you; but only what I have been always and everywhere repeating in the previous discussion and on other occasions: I want to show you the nature of that cause which has occupied my thoughts.</div><div class="sentence"> I shall have to go back to those familiar words which are in the mouth of every one, and first of all assume that there is an absolute beauty and goodness and greatness, and the like; grant me this, and I hope to be able to show you the nature of the cause, and to prove the immortality of the soul.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">483</span> <div class="sentence">  Cebes said: You may proceed at once with the proof, for I grant you this.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">484</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, he said, then I should like to know whether you agree with me in the next step; for I cannot help thinking, if there be anything beautiful other than absolute beauty should there be such, that it can be beautiful only in as far as it partakes of absolute beauty—and I should say the same of everything.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you agree in this notion of the cause?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">485</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, he said, I agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">486</span> <div class="sentence">  He proceeded: I know nothing and can understand nothing of any other of those wise causes which are alleged; and if a person says to me that the bloom of colour, or form, or any such thing is a source of beauty, I leave all that, which is only confusing to me, and simply and singly, and perhaps foolishly, hold and am assured in my own mind that nothing makes a thing beautiful but the presence and participation of beauty in whatever way or manner obtained; for as to the manner I am uncertain, but I stoutly contend that by beauty all beautiful things become beautiful.</div><div class="sentence"> This appears to me to be the safest answer which I can give, either to myself or to another, and to this I cling, in the persuasion that this principle will never be overthrown, and that to myself or to any one who asks the question, I may safely reply, That by beauty beautiful things become beautiful.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you not agree with me?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">487</span> <div class="sentence">  I do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">488</span> <div class="sentence">  And that by greatness only great things become great and greater greater, and by smallness the less become less?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">489</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">490</span> <div class="sentence">  Then if a person were to remark that A is taller by a head than B, and B less by a head than A, you would refuse to admit his statement, and would stoutly contend that what you mean is only that the greater is greater by, and by reason of, greatness, and the less is less only by, and by reason of, smallness; and thus you would avoid the danger of saying that the greater is greater and the less less by the measure of the head, which is the same in both, and would also avoid the monstrous absurdity of supposing that the greater man is greater by reason of the head, which is small.</div><div class="sentence"> You would be afraid to draw such an inference, would you not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">491</span> <div class="sentence">  Indeed, I should, said Cebes, laughing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">492</span> <div class="sentence">  In like manner you would be afraid to say that ten exceeded eight by, and by reason of, two; but would say by, and by reason of, number; or you would say that two cubits exceed one cubit not by a half, but by magnitude?-for there is the same liability to error in all these cases.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">493</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">494</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, would you not be cautious of affirming that the addition of one to one, or the division of one, is the cause of two?</div><div class="sentence"> And you would loudly asseverate that you know of no way in which anything comes into existence except by participation in its own proper essence, and consequently, as far as you know, the only cause of two is the participation in duality—this is the way to make two, and the participation in one is the way to make one.</div><div class="sentence"> You would say: I will let alone puzzles of division and addition—wiser heads than mine may answer them; inexperienced as I am, and ready to start, as the proverb says, at my own shadow, I cannot afford to give up the sure ground of a principle.</div><div class="sentence"> And if any one assails you there, you would not mind him, or answer him, until you had seen whether the consequences which follow agree with one another or not, and when you are further required to give an explanation of this principle, you would go on to assume a higher principle, and a higher, until you found a resting-place in the best of the higher; but you would not confuse the principle and the consequences in your reasoning, like the Eristics—at least if you wanted to discover real existence.</div><div class="sentence"> Not that this confusion signifies to them, who never care or think about the matter at all, for they have the wit to be well pleased with themselves however great may be the turmoil of their ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> But you, if you are a philosopher, will certainly do as I say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">495</span> <div class="sentence">  What you say is most true, said Simmias and Cebes, both speaking at once.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">496</span><div class="speaker">ECHECRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Phaedo; and I do not wonder at their assenting.</div><div class="sentence"> Any one who has the least sense will acknowledge the wonderful clearness of Socrates' reasoning.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">497</span><div class="speaker">PHAEDO</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly, Echecrates; and such was the feeling of the whole company at the time.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">498</span><div class="speaker">ECHECRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, and equally of ourselves, who were not of the company, and are now listening to your recital.</div><div class="sentence"> But what followed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">499</span><div class="speaker">PHAEDO</div><div class="sentence">  After all this had been admitted, and they had that ideas exist, and that other things participate in them and derive their names from them, Socrates, if I remember rightly, said: —</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">500</span> <div class="sentence">  This is your way of speaking; and yet when you say that Simmias is greater than Socrates and less than Phaedo, do you not predicate of Simmias both greatness and smallness?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">501</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, I do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">502</span> <div class="sentence">  But still you allow that Simmias does not really exceed Socrates, as the words may seem to imply, because he is Simmias, but by reason of the size which he has; just as Simmias does not exceed Socrates because he is Simmias, any more than because Socrates is Socrates, but because he has smallness when compared with the greatness of Simmias?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">503</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">504</span> <div class="sentence">  And if Phaedo exceeds him in size, this is not because Phaedo is Phaedo, but because Phaedo has greatness relatively to Simmias, who is comparatively smaller?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">505</span> <div class="sentence">  That is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">506</span> <div class="sentence">  And therefore Simmias is said to be great, and is also said to be small, because he is in a mean between them, exceeding the smallness of the one by his greatness, and allowing the greatness of the other to exceed his smallness.</div><div class="sentence"> He added, laughing, I am speaking like a book, but I believe that what I am saying is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">507</span> <div class="sentence">  Simmias assented.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">508</span> <div class="sentence">  I speak as I do because I want you to agree with me in thinking, not only that absolute greatness will never be great and also small, but that greatness in us or in the concrete will never admit the small or admit of being exceeded: instead of this, one of two things will happen, either the greater will fly or retire before the opposite, which is the less, or at the approach of the less has already ceased to exist; but will not, if allowing or admitting of smallness, be changed by that; even as I, having received and admitted smallness when compared with Simmias, remain just as I was, and am the same small person.</div><div class="sentence"> And as the idea of greatness cannot condescend ever to be or become small, in like manner the smallness in us cannot be or become great; nor can any other opposite which remains the same ever be or become its own opposite, but either passes away or perishes in the change.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">509</span> <div class="sentence">  That, replied Cebes, is quite my notion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">510</span> <div class="sentence">  Hereupon one of the company, though I do not exactly remember which of them, said: In heaven's name, is not this the direct contrary of what was admitted before—that out of the greater came the less and out of the less the greater, and that opposites were simply generated from opposites; but now this principle seems to be utterly denied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">511</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates inclined his head to the speaker and listened.</div><div class="sentence"> I like your courage, he said, in reminding us of this.</div><div class="sentence"> But you do not observe that there is a difference in the two cases.</div><div class="sentence"> For then we were speaking of opposites in the concrete, and now of the essential opposite which, as is affirmed, neither in us nor in nature can ever be at variance with itself: then, my friend, we were speaking of things in which opposites are inherent and which are called after them, but now about the opposites which are inherent in them and which give their name to them; and these essential opposites will never, as we maintain, admit of generation into or out of one another.</div><div class="sentence"> At the same time, turning to Cebes, he said: Are you at all disconcerted, Cebes, at our friend's objection?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">512</span> <div class="sentence">  No, I do not feel so, said Cebes; and yet I cannot deny that I am often disturbed by objections.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">513</span> <div class="sentence">  Then we are agreed after all, said Socrates, that the opposite will never in any case be opposed to itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">514</span> <div class="sentence">  To that we are quite agreed, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">515</span> <div class="sentence">  Yet once more let me ask you to consider the question from another point of view, and see whether you agree with me:—There is a thing which you term heat, and another thing which you term cold?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">516</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">517</span> <div class="sentence">  But are they the same as fire and snow?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">518</span> <div class="sentence">  Most assuredly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">519</span> <div class="sentence">  Heat is a thing different from fire, and cold is not the same with snow?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">520</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">521</span> <div class="sentence">  And yet you will surely admit, that when snow, as was before said, is under the influence of heat, they will not remain snow and heat; but at the advance of the heat, the snow will either retire or perish?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">522</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">523</span> <div class="sentence">  And the fire too at the advance of the cold will either retire or perish; and when the fire is under the influence of the cold, they will not remain as before, fire and cold.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">524</span> <div class="sentence">  That is true, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">525</span> <div class="sentence">  And in some cases the name of the idea is not only attached to the idea in an eternal connection, but anything else which, not being the idea, exists only in the form of the idea, may also lay claim to it.</div><div class="sentence"> I will try to make this clearer by an example:—The odd number is always called by the name of odd?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">526</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">527</span> <div class="sentence">  But is this the only thing which is called odd?</div><div class="sentence"> Are there not other things which have their own name, and yet are called odd, because, although not the same as oddness, they are never without oddness?—that is what I mean to ask—whether numbers such as the number three are not of the class of odd.</div><div class="sentence"> And there are many other examples: would you not say, for example, that three may be called by its proper name, and also be called odd, which is not the same with three?</div><div class="sentence"> and this may be said not only of three but also of five, and of every alternate number—each of them without being oddness is odd, and in the same way two and four, and the other series of alternate numbers, has every number even, without being evenness.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you agree?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">528</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">529</span> <div class="sentence">  Then now mark the point at which I am aiming:—not only do essential opposites exclude one another, but also concrete things, which, although not in themselves opposed, contain opposites; these, I say, likewise reject the idea which is opposed to that which is contained in them, and when it approaches them they either perish or withdraw.</div><div class="sentence"> For example; Will not the number three endure annihilation or anything sooner than be converted into an even number, while remaining three?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">530</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true, said Cebes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">531</span> <div class="sentence">  And yet, he said, the number two is certainly not opposed to the number three?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">532</span> <div class="sentence">  It is not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">533</span> <div class="sentence">  Then not only do opposite ideas repel the advance of one another, but also there are other natures which repel the approach of opposites.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">534</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">535</span> <div class="sentence">  Suppose, he said, that we endeavour, if possible, to determine what these are.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">536</span> <div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">537</span> <div class="sentence">  Are they not, Cebes, such as compel the things of which they have possession, not only to take their own form, but also the form of some opposite?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">538</span> <div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">539</span> <div class="sentence">  I mean, as I was just now saying, and as I am sure that you know, that those things which are possessed by the number three must not only be three in number, but must also be odd.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">540</span> <div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">541</span> <div class="sentence">  And on this oddness, of which the number three has the impress, the opposite idea will never intrude?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">542</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">543</span> <div class="sentence">  And this impress was given by the odd principle?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">544</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">545</span> <div class="sentence">  And to the odd is opposed the even?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">546</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">547</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the idea of the even number will never arrive at three?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">548</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">549</span> <div class="sentence">  Then three has no part in the even?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">550</span> <div class="sentence">  None.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">551</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the triad or number three is uneven?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">552</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">553</span> <div class="sentence">  To return then to my distinction of natures which are not opposed, and yet do not admit opposites—as, in the instance given, three, although not opposed to the even, does not any the more admit of the even, but always brings the opposite into play on the other side; or as two does not receive the odd, or fire the cold—from these examples (and there are many more of them) perhaps you may be able to arrive at the general conclusion, that not only opposites will not receive opposites, but also that nothing which brings the opposite will admit the opposite of that which it brings, in that to which it is brought.</div><div class="sentence"> And here let me recapitulate—for there is no harm in repetition.</div><div class="sentence"> The number five will not admit the nature of the even, any more than ten, which is the double of five, will admit the nature of the odd.</div><div class="sentence"> The double has another opposite, and is not strictly opposed to the odd, but nevertheless rejects the odd altogether.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor again will parts in the ratio 3:2, nor any fraction in which there is a half, nor again in which there is a third, admit the notion of the whole, although they are not opposed to the whole: You will agree?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">554</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, he said, I entirely agree and go along with you in that.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">555</span> <div class="sentence">  And now, he said, let us begin again; and do not you answer my question in the words in which I ask it: let me have not the old safe answer of which I spoke at first, but another equally safe, of which the truth will be inferred by you from what has been just said.</div><div class="sentence"> I mean that if any one asks you 'what that is, of which the inherence makes the body hot,' you will reply not heat (this is what I call the safe and stupid answer), but fire, a far superior answer, which we are now in a condition to give.</div><div class="sentence"> Or if any one asks you 'why a body is diseased,' you will not say from disease, but from fever; and instead of saying that oddness is the cause of odd numbers, you will say that the monad is the cause of them: and so of things in general, as I dare say that you will understand sufficiently without my adducing any further examples.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">556</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, he said, I quite understand you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">557</span> <div class="sentence">  Tell me, then, what is that of which the inherence will render the body alive?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">558</span> <div class="sentence">  The soul, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">559</span> <div class="sentence">  And is this always the case?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">560</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, he said, of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">561</span> <div class="sentence">  Then whatever the soul possesses, to that she comes bearing life?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">562</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">563</span> <div class="sentence">  And is there any opposite to life?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">564</span> <div class="sentence">  There is, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">565</span> <div class="sentence">  And what is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">566</span> <div class="sentence">  Death.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">567</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the soul, as has been acknowledged, will never receive the opposite of what she brings.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">568</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible, replied Cebes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">569</span> <div class="sentence">  And now, he said, what did we just now call that principle which repels the even?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">570</span> <div class="sentence">  The odd.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">572</span> <div class="sentence">  The unmusical, he said, and the unjust.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">573</span> <div class="sentence">  And what do we call the principle which does not admit of death?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">574</span> <div class="sentence">  The immortal, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">575</span> <div class="sentence">  And does the soul admit of death?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">576</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">577</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the soul is immortal?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">578</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">579</span> <div class="sentence">  And may we say that this has been proven?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">580</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, abundantly proven, Socrates, he replied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">581</span> <div class="sentence">  Supposing that the odd were imperishable, must not three be imperishable?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">582</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">583</span> <div class="sentence">  And if that which is cold were imperishable, when the warm principle came attacking the snow, must not the snow have retired whole and unmelted—for it could never have perished, nor could it have remained and admitted the heat?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">584</span> <div class="sentence">  True, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">585</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, if the uncooling or warm principle were imperishable, the fire when assailed by cold would not have perished or have been extinguished, but would have gone away unaffected?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">586</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">587</span> <div class="sentence">  And the same may be said of the immortal: if the immortal is also imperishable, the soul when attacked by death cannot perish; for the preceding argument shows that the soul will not admit of death, or ever be dead, any more than three or the odd number will admit of the even, or fire or the heat in the fire, of the cold.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet a person may say: 'But although the odd will not become even at the approach of the even, why may not the odd perish and the even take the place of the odd?'</div><div class="sentence"> Now to him who makes this objection, we cannot answer that the odd principle is imperishable; for this has not been acknowledged, but if this had been acknowledged, there would have been no difficulty in contending that at the approach of the even the odd principle and the number three took their departure; and the same argument would have held good of fire and heat and any other thing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">588</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">589</span> <div class="sentence">  And the same may be said of the immortal: if the immortal is also imperishable, then the soul will be imperishable as well as immortal; but if not, some other proof of her imperishableness will have to be given.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">590</span> <div class="sentence">  No other proof is needed, he said; for if the immortal, being eternal, is liable to perish, then nothing is imperishable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">591</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, replied Socrates, and yet all men will agree that God, and the essential form of life, and the immortal in general, will never perish.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">592</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, all men, he said—that is true; and what is more, gods, if I am not mistaken, as well as men.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">593</span> <div class="sentence">  Seeing then that the immortal is indestructible, must not the soul, if she is immortal, be also imperishable?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">594</span> <div class="sentence">  Most certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">595</span> <div class="sentence">  Then when death attacks a man, the mortal portion of him may be supposed to die, but the immortal retires at the approach of death and is preserved safe and sound?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">596</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">597</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, Cebes, beyond question, the soul is immortal and imperishable, and our souls will truly exist in another world!</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">598</span> <div class="sentence">  I am convinced, Socrates, said Cebes, and have nothing more to object; but if my friend Simmias, or any one else, has any further objection to make, he had better speak out, and not keep silence, since I do not know to what other season he can defer the discussion, if there is anything which he wants to say or to have said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">599</span> <div class="sentence">  But I have nothing more to say, replied Simmias; nor can I see any reason for doubt after what has been said.</div><div class="sentence"> But I still feel and cannot help feeling uncertain in my own mind, when I think of the greatness of the subject and the feebleness of man.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">600</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, Simmias, replied Socrates, that is well said: and I may add that first principles, even if they appear certain, should be carefully considered; and when they are satisfactorily ascertained, then, with a sort of hesitating confidence in human reason, you may, I think, follow the course of the argument; and if that be plain and clear, there will be no need for any further enquiry.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">601</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">602</span> <div class="sentence">  But then, O my friends, he said, if the soul is really immortal, what care should be taken of her, not only in respect of the portion of time which is called life, but of eternity!</div><div class="sentence"> And the danger of neglecting her from this point of view does indeed appear to be awful.</div><div class="sentence"> If death had only been the end of all, the wicked would have had a good bargain in dying, for they would have been happily quit not only of their body, but of their own evil together with their souls.</div><div class="sentence"> But now, inasmuch as the soul is manifestly immortal, there is no release or salvation from evil except the attainment of the highest virtue and wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> For the soul when on her progress to the world below takes nothing with her but nurture and education; and these are said greatly to benefit or greatly to injure the departed, at the very beginning of his journey thither.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">603</span> <div class="sentence">  For after death, as they say, the genius of each individual, to whom he belonged in life, leads him to a certain place in which the dead are gathered together, whence after judgment has been given they pass into the world below, following the guide, who is appointed to conduct them from this world to the other: and when they have there received their due and remained their time, another guide brings them back again after many revolutions of ages.</div><div class="sentence"> Now this way to the other world is not, as Aeschylus says in the Telephus, a single and straight path—if that were so no guide would be needed, for no one could miss it; but there are many partings of the road, and windings, as I infer from the rites and sacrifices which are offered to the gods below in places where three ways meet on earth.</div><div class="sentence"> The wise and orderly soul follows in the straight path and is conscious of her surroundings; but the soul which desires the body, and which, as I was relating before, has long been fluttering about the lifeless frame and the world of sight, is after many struggles and many sufferings hardly and with violence carried away by her attendant genius, and when she arrives at the place where the other souls are gathered, if she be impure and have done impure deeds, whether foul murders or other crimes which are the brothers of these, and the works of brothers in crime—from that soul every one flees and turns away; no one will be her companion, no one her guide, but alone she wanders in extremity of evil until certain times are fulfilled, and when they are fulfilled, she is borne irresistibly to her own fitting habitation; as every pure and just soul which has passed through life in the company and under the guidance of the gods has also her own proper home.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">604</span> <div class="sentence">  Now the earth has divers wonderful regions, and is indeed in nature and extent very unlike the notions of geographers, as I believe on the authority of one who shall be nameless.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">605</span> <div class="sentence">  What do you mean, Socrates?</div><div class="sentence"> said Simmias.</div><div class="sentence"> I have myself heard many descriptions of the earth, but I do not know, and I should very much like to know, in which of these you put faith.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">606</span> <div class="sentence">  And I, Simmias, replied Socrates, if I had the art of Glaucus would tell you; although I know not that the art of Glaucus could prove the truth of my tale, which I myself should never be able to prove, and even if I could, I fear, Simmias, that my life would come to an end before the argument was completed.</div><div class="sentence"> I may describe to you, however, the form and regions of the earth according to my conception of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">607</span> <div class="sentence">  That, said Simmias, will be enough.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">608</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, then, he said, my conviction is, that the earth is a round body in the centre of the heavens, and therefore has no need of air or any similar force to be a support, but is kept there and hindered from falling or inclining any way by the equability of the surrounding heaven and by her own equipoise.</div><div class="sentence"> For that which, being in equipoise, is in the centre of that which is equably diffused, will not incline any way in any degree, but will always remain in the same state and not deviate.</div><div class="sentence"> And this is my first notion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">609</span> <div class="sentence">  Which is surely a correct one, said Simmias.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">610</span> <div class="sentence">  Also I believe that the earth is very vast, and that we who dwell in the region extending from the river Phasis to the Pillars of Heracles inhabit a small portion only about the sea, like ants or frogs about a marsh, and that there are other inhabitants of many other like places; for everywhere on the face of the earth there are hollows of various forms and sizes, into which the water and the mist and the lower air collect.</div><div class="sentence"> But the true earth is pure and situated in the pure heaven—there are the stars also; and it is the heaven which is commonly spoken of by us as the ether, and of which our own earth is the sediment gathering in the hollows beneath.</div><div class="sentence"> But we who live in these hollows are deceived into the notion that we are dwelling above on the surface of the earth; which is just as if a creature who was at the bottom of the sea were to fancy that he was on the surface of the water, and that the sea was the heaven through which he saw the sun and the other stars, he having never come to the surface by reason of his feebleness and sluggishness, and having never lifted up his head and seen, nor ever heard from one who had seen, how much purer and fairer the world above is than his own.</div><div class="sentence"> And such is exactly our case: for we are dwelling in a hollow of the earth, and fancy that we are on the surface; and the air we call the heaven, in which we imagine that the stars move.</div><div class="sentence"> But the fact is, that owing to our feebleness and sluggishness we are prevented from reaching the surface of the air: for if any man could arrive at the exterior limit, or take the wings of a bird and come to the top, then like a fish who puts his head out of the water and sees this world, he would see a world beyond; and, if the nature of man could sustain the sight, he would acknowledge that this other world was the place of the true heaven and the true light and the true earth.</div><div class="sentence"> For our earth, and the stones, and the entire region which surrounds us, are spoilt and corroded, as in the sea all things are corroded by the brine, neither is there any noble or perfect growth, but caverns only, and sand, and an endless slough of mud: and even the shore is not to be compared to the fairer sights of this world.</div><div class="sentence"> And still less is this our world to be compared with the other.</div><div class="sentence"> Of that upper earth which is under the heaven, I can tell you a charming tale, Simmias, which is well worth hearing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">611</span> <div class="sentence">  And we, Socrates, replied Simmias, shall be charmed to listen to you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">612</span> <div class="sentence">  The tale, my friend, he said, is as follows:—In the first place, the earth, when looked at from above, is in appearance streaked like one of those balls which have leather coverings in twelve pieces, and is decked with various colours, of which the colours used by painters on earth are in a manner samples.</div><div class="sentence"> But there the whole earth is made up of them, and they are brighter far and clearer than ours; there is a purple of wonderful lustre, also the radiance of gold, and the white which is in the earth is whiter than any chalk or snow.</div><div class="sentence"> Of these and other colours the earth is made up, and they are more in number and fairer than the eye of man has ever seen; the very hollows (of which I was speaking) filled with air and water have a colour of their own, and are seen like light gleaming amid the diversity of the other colours, so that the whole presents a single and continuous appearance of variety in unity.</div><div class="sentence"> And in this fair region everything that grows—trees, and flowers, and fruits—are in a like degree fairer than any here; and there are hills, having stones in them in a like degree smoother, and more transparent, and fairer in colour than our highly-valued emeralds and sardonyxes and jaspers, and other gems, which are but minute fragments of them: for there all the stones are like our precious stones, and fairer still (compare Republic).</div><div class="sentence"> The reason is, that they are pure, and not, like our precious stones, infected or corroded by the corrupt briny elements which coagulate among us, and which breed foulness and disease both in earth and stones, as well as in animals and plants.</div><div class="sentence"> They are the jewels of the upper earth, which also shines with gold and silver and the like, and they are set in the light of day and are large and abundant and in all places, making the earth a sight to gladden the beholder's eye.</div><div class="sentence"> And there are animals and men, some in a middle region, others dwelling about the air as we dwell about the sea; others in islands which the air flows round, near the continent: and in a word, the air is used by them as the water and the sea are by us, and the ether is to them what the air is to us.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover, the temperament of their seasons is such that they have no disease, and live much longer than we do, and have sight and hearing and smell, and all the other senses, in far greater perfection, in the same proportion that air is purer than water or the ether than air.</div><div class="sentence"> Also they have temples and sacred places in which the gods really dwell, and they hear their voices and receive their answers, and are conscious of them and hold converse with them, and they see the sun, moon, and stars as they truly are, and their other blessedness is of a piece with this.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">613</span> <div class="sentence">  Such is the nature of the whole earth, and of the things which are around the earth; and there are divers regions in the hollows on the face of the globe everywhere, some of them deeper and more extended than that which we inhabit, others deeper but with a narrower opening than ours, and some are shallower and also wider.</div><div class="sentence"> All have numerous perforations, and there are passages broad and narrow in the interior of the earth, connecting them with one another; and there flows out of and into them, as into basins, a vast tide of water, and huge subterranean streams of perennial rivers, and springs hot and cold, and a great fire, and great rivers of fire, and streams of liquid mud, thin or thick (like the rivers of mud in Sicily, and the lava streams which follow them), and the regions about which they happen to flow are filled up with them.</div><div class="sentence"> And there is a swinging or see-saw in the interior of the earth which moves all this up and down, and is due to the following cause:—There is a chasm which is the vastest of them all, and pierces right through the whole earth; this is that chasm which Homer describes in the words,—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">614</span> <div class="sentence">  and which he in other places, and many other poets, have called Tartarus.</div><div class="sentence"> And the see-saw is caused by the streams flowing into and out of this chasm, and they each have the nature of the soil through which they flow.</div><div class="sentence"> And the reason why the streams are always flowing in and out, is that the watery element has no bed or bottom, but is swinging and surging up and down, and the surrounding wind and air do the same; they follow the water up and down, hither and thither, over the earth—just as in the act of respiration the air is always in process of inhalation and exhalation;—and the wind swinging with the water in and out produces fearful and irresistible blasts: when the waters retire with a rush into the lower parts of the earth, as they are called, they flow through the earth in those regions, and fill them up like water raised by a pump, and then when they leave those regions and rush back hither, they again fill the hollows here, and when these are filled, flow through subterranean channels and find their way to their several places, forming seas, and lakes, and rivers, and springs.</div><div class="sentence"> Thence they again enter the earth, some of them making a long circuit into many lands, others going to a few places and not so distant; and again fall into Tartarus, some at a point a good deal lower than that at which they rose, and others not much lower, but all in some degree lower than the point from which they came.</div><div class="sentence"> And some burst forth again on the opposite side, and some on the same side, and some wind round the earth with one or many folds like the coils of a serpent, and descend as far as they can, but always return and fall into the chasm.</div><div class="sentence"> The rivers flowing in either direction can descend only to the centre and no further, for opposite to the rivers is a precipice.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">615</span> <div class="sentence">  Now these rivers are many, and mighty, and diverse, and there are four principal ones, of which the greatest and outermost is that called Oceanus, which flows round the earth in a circle; and in the opposite direction flows Acheron, which passes under the earth through desert places into the Acherusian lake: this is the lake to the shores of which the souls of the many go when they are dead, and after waiting an appointed time, which is to some a longer and to some a shorter time, they are sent back to be born again as animals.</div><div class="sentence"> The third river passes out between the two, and near the place of outlet pours into a vast region of fire, and forms a lake larger than the Mediterranean Sea, boiling with water and mud; and proceeding muddy and turbid, and winding about the earth, comes, among other places, to the extremities of the Acherusian Lake, but mingles not with the waters of the lake, and after making many coils about the earth plunges into Tartarus at a deeper level.</div><div class="sentence"> This is that Pyriphlegethon, as the stream is called, which throws up jets of fire in different parts of the earth.</div><div class="sentence"> The fourth river goes out on the opposite side, and falls first of all into a wild and savage region, which is all of a dark-blue colour, like lapis lazuli; and this is that river which is called the Stygian river, and falls into and forms the Lake Styx, and after falling into the lake and receiving strange powers in the waters, passes under the earth, winding round in the opposite direction, and comes near the Acherusian lake from the opposite side to Pyriphlegethon.</div><div class="sentence"> And the water of this river too mingles with no other, but flows round in a circle and falls into Tartarus over against Pyriphlegethon; and the name of the river, as the poets say, is Cocytus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">616</span> <div class="sentence">  Such is the nature of the other world; and when the dead arrive at the place to which the genius of each severally guides them, first of all, they have sentence passed upon them, as they have lived well and piously or not.</div><div class="sentence"> And those who appear to have lived neither well nor ill, go to the river Acheron, and embarking in any vessels which they may find, are carried in them to the lake, and there they dwell and are purified of their evil deeds, and having suffered the penalty of the wrongs which they have done to others, they are absolved, and receive the rewards of their good deeds, each of them according to his deserts.</div><div class="sentence"> But those who appear to be incurable by reason of the greatness of their crimes—who have committed many and terrible deeds of sacrilege, murders foul and violent, or the like—such are hurled into Tartarus which is their suitable destiny, and they never come out.</div><div class="sentence"> Those again who have committed crimes, which, although great, are not irremediable—who in a moment of anger, for example, have done violence to a father or a mother, and have repented for the remainder of their lives, or, who have taken the life of another under the like extenuating circumstances—these are plunged into Tartarus, the pains of which they are compelled to undergo for a year, but at the end of the year the wave casts them forth—mere homicides by way of Cocytus, parricides and matricides by Pyriphlegethon—and they are borne to the Acherusian lake, and there they lift up their voices and call upon the victims whom they have slain or wronged, to have pity on them, and to be kind to them, and let them come out into the lake.</div><div class="sentence"> And if they prevail, then they come forth and cease from their troubles; but if not, they are carried back again into Tartarus and from thence into the rivers unceasingly, until they obtain mercy from those whom they have wronged: for that is the sentence inflicted upon them by their judges.</div><div class="sentence"> Those too who have been pre-eminent for holiness of life are released from this earthly prison, and go to their pure home which is above, and dwell in the purer earth; and of these, such as have duly purified themselves with philosophy live henceforth altogether without the body, in mansions fairer still which may not be described, and of which the time would fail me to tell.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">617</span> <div class="sentence">  Wherefore, Simmias, seeing all these things, what ought not we to do that we may obtain virtue and wisdom in this life?</div><div class="sentence"> Fair is the prize, and the hope great!</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">618</span> <div class="sentence">  A man of sense ought not to say, nor will I be very confident, that the description which I have given of the soul and her mansions is exactly true.</div><div class="sentence"> But I do say that, inasmuch as the soul is shown to be immortal, he may venture to think, not improperly or unworthily, that something of the kind is true.</div><div class="sentence"> The venture is a glorious one, and he ought to comfort himself with words like these, which is the reason why I lengthen out the tale.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore, I say, let a man be of good cheer about his soul, who having cast away the pleasures and ornaments of the body as alien to him and working harm rather than good, has sought after the pleasures of knowledge; and has arrayed the soul, not in some foreign attire, but in her own proper jewels, temperance, and justice, and courage, and nobility, and truth—in these adorned she is ready to go on her journey to the world below, when her hour comes.</div><div class="sentence"> You, Simmias and Cebes, and all other men, will depart at some time or other.</div><div class="sentence"> Me already, as the tragic poet would say, the voice of fate calls.</div><div class="sentence"> Soon I must drink the poison; and I think that I had better repair to the bath first, in order that the women may not have the trouble of washing my body after I am dead.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">619</span> <div class="sentence">  When he had done speaking, Crito said: And have you any commands for us, Socrates—anything to say about your children, or any other matter in which we can serve you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">620</span> <div class="sentence">  Nothing particular, Crito, he replied: only, as I have always told you, take care of yourselves; that is a service which you may be ever rendering to me and mine and to all of us, whether you promise to do so or not.</div><div class="sentence"> But if you have no thought for yourselves, and care not to walk according to the rule which I have prescribed for you, not now for the first time, however much you may profess or promise at the moment, it will be of no avail.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">621</span> <div class="sentence">  We will do our best, said Crito: And in what way shall we bury you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">622</span> <div class="sentence">  In any way that you like; but you must get hold of me, and take care that I do not run away from you.</div><div class="sentence"> Then he turned to us, and added with a smile:—I cannot make Crito believe that I am the same Socrates who have been talking and conducting the argument; he fancies that I am the other Socrates whom he will soon see, a dead body—and he asks, How shall he bury me?</div><div class="sentence"> And though I have spoken many words in the endeavour to show that when I have drunk the poison I shall leave you and go to the joys of the blessed,—these words of mine, with which I was comforting you and myself, have had, as I perceive, no effect upon Crito.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore I want you to be surety for me to him now, as at the trial he was surety to the judges for me: but let the promise be of another sort; for he was surety for me to the judges that I would remain, and you must be my surety to him that I shall not remain, but go away and depart; and then he will suffer less at my death, and not be grieved when he sees my body being burned or buried.</div><div class="sentence"> I would not have him sorrow at my hard lot, or say at the burial, Thus we lay out Socrates, or, Thus we follow him to the grave or bury him; for false words are not only evil in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil.</div><div class="sentence"> Be of good cheer, then, my dear Crito, and say that you are burying my body only, and do with that whatever is usual, and what you think best.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">623</span> <div class="sentence">  When he had spoken these words, he arose and went into a chamber to bathe; Crito followed him and told us to wait.</div><div class="sentence"> So we remained behind, talking and thinking of the subject of discourse, and also of the greatness of our sorrow; he was like a father of whom we were being bereaved, and we were about to pass the rest of our lives as orphans.</div><div class="sentence"> When he had taken the bath his children were brought to him—(he had two young sons and an elder one); and the women of his family also came, and he talked to them and gave them a few directions in the presence of Crito; then he dismissed them and returned to us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">624</span> <div class="sentence">  Now the hour of sunset was near, for a good deal of time had passed while he was within.</div><div class="sentence"> When he came out, he sat down with us again after his bath, but not much was said.</div><div class="sentence"> Soon the jailer, who was the servant of the Eleven, entered and stood by him, saying:—To you, Socrates, whom I know to be the noblest and gentlest and best of all who ever came to this place, I will not impute the angry feelings of other men, who rage and swear at me, when, in obedience to the authorities, I bid them drink the poison—indeed, I am sure that you will not be angry with me; for others, as you are aware, and not I, are to blame.</div><div class="sentence"> And so fare you well, and try to bear lightly what must needs be—you know my errand.</div><div class="sentence"> Then bursting into tears he turned away and went out.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">625</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates looked at him and said: I return your good wishes, and will do as you bid.</div><div class="sentence"> Then turning to us, he said, How charming the man is: since I have been in prison he has always been coming to see me, and at times he would talk to me, and was as good to me as could be, and now see how generously he sorrows on my account.</div><div class="sentence"> We must do as he says, Crito; and therefore let the cup be brought, if the poison is prepared: if not, let the attendant prepare some.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">626</span> <div class="sentence">  Yet, said Crito, the sun is still upon the hill-tops, and I know that many a one has taken the draught late, and after the announcement has been made to him, he has eaten and drunk, and enjoyed the society of his beloved; do not hurry—there is time enough.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">627</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates said: Yes, Crito, and they of whom you speak are right in so acting, for they think that they will be gainers by the delay; but I am right in not following their example, for I do not think that I should gain anything by drinking the poison a little later; I should only be ridiculous in my own eyes for sparing and saving a life which is already forfeit.</div><div class="sentence"> Please then to do as I say, and not to refuse me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">628</span> <div class="sentence">  Crito made a sign to the servant, who was standing by; and he went out, and having been absent for some time, returned with the jailer carrying the cup of poison.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates said: You, my good friend, who are experienced in these matters, shall give me directions how I am to proceed.</div><div class="sentence"> The man answered: You have only to walk about until your legs are heavy, and then to lie down, and the poison will act.</div><div class="sentence"> At the same time he handed the cup to Socrates, who in the easiest and gentlest manner, without the least fear or change of colour or feature, looking at the man with all his eyes, Echecrates, as his manner was, took the cup and said: What do you say about making a libation out of this cup to any god?</div><div class="sentence"> May I, or not?</div><div class="sentence"> The man answered: We only prepare, Socrates, just so much as we deem enough.</div><div class="sentence"> I understand, he said: but I may and must ask the gods to prosper my journey from this to the other world—even so—and so be it according to my prayer.</div><div class="sentence"> Then raising the cup to his lips, quite readily and cheerfully he drank off the poison.</div><div class="sentence"> And hitherto most of us had been able to control our sorrow; but now when we saw him drinking, and saw too that he had finished the draught, we could no longer forbear, and in spite of myself my own tears were flowing fast; so that I covered my face and wept, not for him, but at the thought of my own calamity in having to part from such a friend.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor was I the first; for Crito, when he found himself unable to restrain his tears, had got up, and I followed; and at that moment, Apollodorus, who had been weeping all the time, broke out in a loud and passionate cry which made cowards of us all.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates alone retained his calmness: What is this strange outcry?</div><div class="sentence"> he said.</div><div class="sentence"> I sent away the women mainly in order that they might not misbehave in this way, for I have been told that a man should die in peace.</div><div class="sentence"> Be quiet, then, and have patience.</div><div class="sentence"> When we heard his words we were ashamed, and refrained our tears; and he walked about until, as he said, his legs began to fail, and then he lay on his back, according to the directions, and the man who gave him the poison now and then looked at his feet and legs; and after a while he pressed his foot hard, and asked him if he could feel; and he said, No; and then his leg, and so upwards and upwards, and showed us that he was cold and stiff.</div><div class="sentence"> And he felt them himself, and said: When the poison reaches the heart, that will be the end.</div><div class="sentence"> He was beginning to grow cold about the groin, when he uncovered his face, for he had covered himself up, and said—they were his last words—he said: Crito, I owe a cock to Asclepius; will you remember to pay the debt?</div><div class="sentence"> The debt shall be paid, said Crito; is there anything else?</div><div class="sentence"> There was no answer to this question; but in a minute or two a movement was heard, and the attendants uncovered him; his eyes were set, and Crito closed his eyes and mouth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">629</span> <div class="sentence">  Such was the end, Echecrates, of our friend; concerning whom I may truly say, that of all the men of his time whom I have known, he was the wisest and justest and best.</div></div>
