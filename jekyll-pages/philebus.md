<h2>INTRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  The Philebus appears to be one of the later writings of Plato, in which the style has begun to alter, and the dramatic and poetical element has become subordinate to the speculative and philosophical.</div><div class="sentence"> In the development of abstract thought great advances have been made on the Protagoras or the Phaedrus, and even on the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> But there is a corresponding diminution of artistic skill, a want of character in the persons, a laboured march in the dialogue, and a degree of confusion and incompleteness in the general design.</div><div class="sentence"> As in the speeches of Thucydides, the multiplication of ideas seems to interfere with the power of expression.</div><div class="sentence"> Instead of the equally diffused grace and ease of the earlier dialogues there occur two or three highly-wrought passages; instead of the ever-flowing play of humour, now appearing, now concealed, but always present, are inserted a good many bad jests, as we may venture to term them.</div><div class="sentence"> We may observe an attempt at artificial ornament, and far-fetched modes of expression; also clamorous demands on the part of his companions, that Socrates shall answer his own questions, as well as other defects of style, which remind us of the Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> The connection is often abrupt and inharmonious, and far from clear.</div><div class="sentence"> Many points require further explanation; e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> the reference of pleasure to the indefinite class, compared with the assertion which almost immediately follows, that pleasure and pain naturally have their seat in the third or mixed class: these two statements are unreconciled.</div><div class="sentence"> In like manner, the table of goods does not distinguish between the two heads of measure and symmetry; and though a hint is given that the divine mind has the first place, nothing is said of this in the final summing up.</div><div class="sentence"> The relation of the goods to the sciences does not appear; though dialectic may be thought to correspond to the highest good, the sciences and arts and true opinions are enumerated in the fourth class.</div><div class="sentence"> We seem to have an intimation of a further discussion, in which some topics lightly passed over were to receive a fuller consideration.</div><div class="sentence"> The various uses of the word 'mixed,' for the mixed life, the mixed class of elements, the mixture of pleasures, or of pleasure and pain, are a further source of perplexity.</div><div class="sentence"> Our ignorance of the opinions which Plato is attacking is also an element of obscurity.</div><div class="sentence"> Many things in a controversy might seem relevant, if we knew to what they were intended to refer.</div><div class="sentence"> But no conjecture will enable us to supply what Plato has not told us; or to explain, from our fragmentary knowledge of them, the relation in which his doctrine stood to the Eleatic Being or the Megarian good, or to the theories of Aristippus or Antisthenes respecting pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor are we able to say how far Plato in the Philebus conceives the finite and infinite (which occur both in the fragments of Philolaus and in the Pythagorean table of opposites) in the same manner as contemporary Pythagoreans.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  There is little in the characters which is worthy of remark.</div><div class="sentence"> The Socrates of the Philebus is devoid of any touch of Socratic irony, though here, as in the Phaedrus, he twice attributes the flow of his ideas to a sudden inspiration.</div><div class="sentence"> The interlocutor Protarchus, the son of Callias, who has been a hearer of Gorgias, is supposed to begin as a disciple of the partisans of pleasure, but is drawn over to the opposite side by the arguments of Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> The instincts of ingenuous youth are easily induced to take the better part.</div><div class="sentence"> Philebus, who has withdrawn from the argument, is several times brought back again, that he may support pleasure, of which he remains to the end the uncompromising advocate.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, the youthful group of listeners by whom he is surrounded, 'Philebus' boys' as they are termed, whose presence is several times intimated, are described as all of them at last convinced by the arguments of Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> They bear a very faded resemblance to the interested audiences of the Charmides, Lysis, or Protagoras.</div><div class="sentence"> Other signs of relation to external life in the dialogue, or references to contemporary things and persons, with the single exception of the allusions to the anonymous enemies of pleasure, and the teachers of the flux, there are none.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  The omission of the doctrine of recollection, derived from a previous state of existence, is a note of progress in the philosophy of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> The transcendental theory of pre-existent ideas, which is chiefly discussed by him in the Meno, the Phaedo, and the Phaedrus, has given way to a psychological one.</div><div class="sentence"> The omission is rendered more significant by his having occasion to speak of memory as the basis of desire.</div><div class="sentence"> Of the ideas he treats in the same sceptical spirit which appears in his criticism of them in the Parmenides.</div><div class="sentence"> He touches on the same difficulties and he gives no answer to them.</div><div class="sentence"> His mode of speaking of the analytical and synthetical processes may be compared with his discussion of the same subject in the Phaedrus; here he dwells on the importance of dividing the genera into all the species, while in the Phaedrus he conveys the same truth in a figure, when he speaks of carving the whole, which is described under the image of a victim, into parts or members, 'according to their natural articulation, without breaking any of them.'</div><div class="sentence"> There is also a difference, which may be noted, between the two dialogues.</div><div class="sentence"> For whereas in the Phaedrus, and also in the Symposium, the dialectician is described as a sort of enthusiast or lover, in the Philebus, as in all the later writings of Plato, the element of love is wanting; the topic is only introduced, as in the Republic, by way of illustration.</div><div class="sentence"> On other subjects of which they treat in common, such as the nature and kinds of pleasure, true and false opinion, the nature of the good, the order and relation of the sciences, the Republic is less advanced than the Philebus, which contains, perhaps, more metaphysical truth more obscurely expressed than any other Platonic dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> Here, as Plato expressly tells us, he is 'forging weapons of another make,' i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> new categories and modes of conception, though 'some of the old ones might do again.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  But if superior in thought and dialectical power, the Philebus falls very far short of the Republic in fancy and feeling.</div><div class="sentence"> The development of the reason undisturbed by the emotions seems to be the ideal at which Plato aims in his later dialogues.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no mystic enthusiasm or rapturous contemplation of ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> Whether we attribute this change to the greater feebleness of age, or to the development of the quarrel between philosophy and poetry in Plato's own mind, or perhaps, in some degree, to a carelessness about artistic effect, when he was absorbed in abstract ideas, we can hardly be wrong in assuming, amid such a variety of indications, derived from style as well as subject, that the Philebus belongs to the later period of his life and authorship.</div><div class="sentence"> But in this, as in all the later writings of Plato, there are not wanting thoughts and expressions in which he rises to his highest level.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  The plan is complicated, or rather, perhaps, the want of plan renders the progress of the dialogue difficult to follow.</div><div class="sentence"> A few leading ideas seem to emerge: the relation of the one and many, the four original elements, the kinds of pleasure, the kinds of knowledge, the scale of goods.</div><div class="sentence"> These are only partially connected with one another.</div><div class="sentence"> The dialogue is not rightly entitled 'Concerning pleasure' or 'Concerning good,' but should rather be described as treating of the relations of pleasure and knowledge, after they have been duly analyzed, to the good.</div><div class="sentence"> (1) The question is asked, whether pleasure or wisdom is the chief good, or some nature higher than either; and if the latter, how pleasure and wisdom are related to this higher good.</div><div class="sentence"> (2) Before we can reply with exactness, we must know the kinds of pleasure and the kinds of knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> (3) But still we may affirm generally, that the combined life of pleasure and wisdom or knowledge has more of the character of the good than either of them when isolated.</div><div class="sentence"> (4) to determine which of them partakes most of the higher nature, we must know under which of the four unities or elements they respectively fall.</div><div class="sentence"> These are, first, the infinite; secondly, the finite; thirdly, the union of the two; fourthly, the cause of the union.</div><div class="sentence"> Pleasure is of the first, wisdom or knowledge of the third class, while reason or mind is akin to the fourth or highest.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  (5) Pleasures are of two kinds, the mixed and unmixed.</div><div class="sentence"> Of mixed pleasures there are three classesâ(a) those in which both the pleasures and pains are corporeal, as in eating and hunger; (b) those in which there is a pain of the body and pleasure of the mind, as when you are hungry and are looking forward to a feast; (c) those in which the pleasure and pain are both mental.</div><div class="sentence"> Of unmixed pleasures there are four kinds: those of sight, hearing, smell, knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  (6) The sciences are likewise divided into two classes, theoretical and productive: of the latter, one part is pure, the other impure.</div><div class="sentence"> The pure part consists of arithmetic, mensuration, and weighing.</div><div class="sentence"> Arts like carpentering, which have an exact measure, are to be regarded as higher than music, which for the most part is mere guess-work.</div><div class="sentence"> But there is also a higher arithmetic, and a higher mensuration, which is exclusively theoretical; and a dialectical science, which is higher still and the truest and purest knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  (7) We are now able to determine the composition of the perfect life.</div><div class="sentence"> First, we admit the pure pleasures and the pure sciences; secondly, the impure sciences, but not the impure pleasures.</div><div class="sentence"> We have next to discover what element of goodness is contained in this mixture.</div><div class="sentence"> There are three criteria of goodnessâbeauty, symmetry, truth.</div><div class="sentence"> These are clearly more akin to reason than to pleasure, and will enable us to fix the places of both of them in the scale of good.</div><div class="sentence"> First in the scale is measure; the second place is assigned to symmetry; the third, to reason and wisdom; the fourth, to knowledge and true opinion; the fifth, to pure pleasures; and here the Muse says 'Enough.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span> <div class="sentence">  'Bidding farewell to Philebus and Socrates,' we may now consider the metaphysical conceptions which are presented to us.</div><div class="sentence"> These are (I) the paradox of unity and plurality; (II) the table of categories or elements; (III) the kinds of pleasure; (IV) the kinds of knowledge; (V) the conception of the good.</div><div class="sentence"> We may then proceed to examine (VI) the relation of the Philebus to the Republic, and to other dialogues.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span> <div class="sentence">  I.</div><div class="sentence"> The paradox of the one and many originated in the restless dialectic of Zeno, who sought to prove the absolute existence of the one by showing the contradictions that are involved in admitting the existence of the many (compare Parm.).</div><div class="sentence"> Zeno illustrated the contradiction by well-known examples taken from outward objects.</div><div class="sentence"> But Socrates seems to intimate that the time had arrived for discarding these hackneyed illustrations; such difficulties had long been solved by common sense ('solvitur ambulando'); the fact of the co-existence of opposites was a sufficient answer to them.</div><div class="sentence"> He will leave them to Cynics and Eristics; the youth of Athens may discourse of them to their parents.</div><div class="sentence"> To no rational man could the circumstance that the body is one, but has many members, be any longer a stumbling-block.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span> <div class="sentence">  Plato's difficulty seems to begin in the region of ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> He cannot understand how an absolute unity, such as the Eleatic Being, can be broken up into a number of individuals, or be in and out of them at once.</div><div class="sentence"> Philosophy had so deepened or intensified the nature of one or Being, by the thoughts of successive generations, that the mind could no longer imagine 'Being' as in a state of change or division.</div><div class="sentence"> To say that the verb of existence is the copula, or that unity is a mere unit, is to us easy; but to the Greek in a particular stage of thought such an analysis involved the same kind of difficulty as the conception of God existing both in and out of the world would to ourselves.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor was he assisted by the analogy of sensible objects.</div><div class="sentence"> The sphere of mind was dark and mysterious to him; but instead of being illustrated by sense, the greatest light appeared to be thrown on the nature of ideas when they were contrasted with sense.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span> <div class="sentence">  Both here and in the Parmenides, where similar difficulties are raised, Plato seems prepared to desert his ancient ground.</div><div class="sentence"> He cannot tell the relation in which abstract ideas stand to one another, and therefore he transfers the one and many out of his transcendental world, and proceeds to lay down practical rules for their application to different branches of knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> As in the Republic he supposes the philosopher to proceed by regular steps, until he arrives at the idea of good; as in the Sophist and Politicus he insists that in dividing the whole into its parts we should bisect in the middle in the hope of finding species; as in the Phaedrus (see above) he would have 'no limb broken' of the organism of knowledge;âso in the Philebus he urges the necessity of filling up all the intermediate links which occur (compare Bacon's 'media axiomata') in the passage from unity to infinity.</div><div class="sentence"> With him the idea of science may be said to anticipate science; at a time when the sciences were not yet divided, he wants to impress upon us the importance of classification; neither neglecting the many individuals, nor attempting to count them all, but finding the genera and species under which they naturally fall.</div><div class="sentence"> Here, then, and in the parallel passages of the Phaedrus and of the Sophist, is found the germ of the most fruitful notion of modern science.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span> <div class="sentence">  Plato describes with ludicrous exaggeration the influence exerted by the one and many on the minds of young men in their first fervour of metaphysical enthusiasm (compare Republic).</div><div class="sentence"> But they are none the less an everlasting quality of reason or reasoning which never grows old in us.</div><div class="sentence"> At first we have but a confused conception of them, analogous to the eyes blinking at the light in the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> To this Plato opposes the revelation from Heaven of the real relations of them, which some Prometheus, who gave the true fire from heaven, is supposed to have imparted to us.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato is speaking of two thingsâ(1) the crude notion of the one and many, which powerfully affects the ordinary mind when first beginning to think; (2) the same notion when cleared up by the help of dialectic.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span> <div class="sentence">  To us the problem of the one and many has lost its chief interest and perplexity.</div><div class="sentence"> We readily acknowledge that a whole has many parts, that the continuous is also the divisible, that in all objects of sense there is a one and many, and that a like principle may be applied to analogy to purely intellectual conceptions.</div><div class="sentence"> If we attend to the meaning of the words, we are compelled to admit that two contradictory statements are true.</div><div class="sentence"> But the antinomy is so familiar as to be scarcely observed by us.</div><div class="sentence"> Our sense of the contradiction, like Plato's, only begins in a higher sphere, when we speak of necessity and free-will, of mind and body, of Three Persons and One Substance, and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> The world of knowledge is always dividing more and more; every truth is at first the enemy of every other truth.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet without this division there can be no truth; nor any complete truth without the reunion of the parts into a whole.</div><div class="sentence"> And hence the coexistence of opposites in the unity of the idea is regarded by Hegel as the supreme principle of philosophy; and the law of contradiction, which is affirmed by logicians to be an ultimate principle of the human mind, is displaced by another law, which asserts the coexistence of contradictories as imperfect and divided elements of the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> Without entering further into the depths of Hegelianism, we may remark that this and all similar attempts to reconcile antinomies have their origin in the old Platonic problem of the 'One and Many.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span> <div class="sentence">  II.</div><div class="sentence"> 1.</div><div class="sentence"> The first of Plato's categories or elements is the infinite.</div><div class="sentence"> This is the negative of measure or limit; the unthinkable, the unknowable; of which nothing can be affirmed; the mixture or chaos which preceded distinct kinds in the creation of the world; the first vague impression of sense; the more or less which refuses to be reduced to rule, having certain affinities with evil, with pleasure, with ignorance, and which in the scale of being is farthest removed from the beautiful and good.</div><div class="sentence"> To a Greek of the age of Plato, the idea of an infinite mind would have been an absurdity.</div><div class="sentence"> He would have insisted that 'the good is of the nature of the finite,' and that the infinite is a mere negative, which is on the level of sensation, and not of thought.</div><div class="sentence"> He was aware that there was a distinction between the infinitely great and the infinitely small, but he would have equally denied the claim of either to true existence.</div><div class="sentence"> Of that positive infinity, or infinite reality, which we attribute to God, he had no conception.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span> <div class="sentence">  The Greek conception of the infinite would be more truly described, in our way of speaking, as the indefinite.</div><div class="sentence"> To us, the notion of infinity is subsequent rather than prior to the finite, expressing not absolute vacancy or negation, but only the removal of limit or restraint, which we suppose to exist not before but after we have already set bounds to thought and matter, and divided them after their kinds.</div><div class="sentence"> From different points of view, either the finite or infinite may be looked upon respectively both as positive and negative (compare 'Omnis determinatio est negatio')' and the conception of the one determines that of the other.</div><div class="sentence"> The Greeks and the moderns seem to be nearly at the opposite poles in their manner of regarding them.</div><div class="sentence"> And both are surprised when they make the discovery, as Plato has done in the Sophist, how large an element negation forms in the framework of their thoughts.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span> <div class="sentence">  2, 3.</div><div class="sentence"> The finite element which mingles with and regulates the infinite is best expressed to us by the word 'law.'</div><div class="sentence"> It is that which measures all things and assigns to them their limit; which preserves them in their natural state, and brings them within the sphere of human cognition.</div><div class="sentence"> This is described by the terms harmony, health, order, perfection, and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> All things, in as far as they are good, even pleasures, which are for the most part indefinite, partake of this element.</div><div class="sentence"> We should be wrong in attributing to Plato the conception of laws of nature derived from observation and experiment.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet he has as intense a conviction as any modern philosopher that nature does not proceed by chance.</div><div class="sentence"> But observing that the wonderful construction of number and figure, which he had within himself, and which seemed to be prior to himself, explained a part of the phenomena of the external world, he extended their principles to the whole, finding in them the true type both of human life and of the order of nature.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span> <div class="sentence">  Two other points may be noticed respecting the third class.</div><div class="sentence"> First, that Plato seems to be unconscious of any interval or chasm which separates the finite from the infinite.</div><div class="sentence"> The one is in various ways and degrees working in the other.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence he has implicitly answered the difficulty with which he started, of how the one could remain one and yet be divided among many individuals, or 'how ideas could be in and out of themselves,' and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> Secondly, that in this mixed class we find the idea of beauty.</div><div class="sentence"> Good, when exhibited under the aspect of measure or symmetry, becomes beauty.</div><div class="sentence"> And if we translate his language into corresponding modern terms, we shall not be far wrong in saying that here, as well as in the Republic, Plato conceives beauty under the idea of proportion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span> <div class="sentence">  4.</div><div class="sentence"> Last and highest in the list of principles or elements is the cause of the union of the finite and infinite, to which Plato ascribes the order of the world.</div><div class="sentence"> Reasoning from man to the universe, he argues that as there is a mind in the one, there must be a mind in the other, which he identifies with the royal mind of Zeus.</div><div class="sentence"> This is the first cause of which 'our ancestors spoke,' as he says, appealing to tradition, in the Philebus as well as in the Timaeus.</div><div class="sentence"> The 'one and many' is also supposed to have been revealed by tradition.</div><div class="sentence"> For the mythical element has not altogether disappeared.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span> <div class="sentence">  Some characteristic differences may here be noted, which distinguish the ancient from the modern mode of conceiving God.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span> <div class="sentence">  a.</div><div class="sentence"> To Plato, the idea of God or mind is both personal and impersonal.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor in ascribing, as appears to us, both these attributes to him, and in speaking of God both in the masculine and neuter gender, did he seem to himself inconsistent.</div><div class="sentence"> For the difference between the personal and impersonal was not marked to him as to ourselves.</div><div class="sentence"> We make a fundamental distinction between a thing and a person, while to Plato, by the help of various intermediate abstractions, such as end, good, cause, they appear almost to meet in one, or to be two aspects of the same.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence, without any reconciliation or even remark, in the Republic he speaks at one time of God or Gods, and at another time of the Good.</div><div class="sentence"> So in the Phaedrus he seems to pass unconsciously from the concrete to the abstract conception of the Ideas in the same dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor in the Philebus is he careful to show in what relation the idea of the divine mind stands to the supreme principle of measure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span> <div class="sentence">  b.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, to us there is a strongly-marked distinction between a first cause and a final cause.</div><div class="sentence"> And we should commonly identify a first cause with God, and the final cause with the world, which is His work.</div><div class="sentence"> But Plato, though not a Pantheist, and very far from confounding God with the world, tends to identify the first with the final cause.</div><div class="sentence"> The cause of the union of the finite and infinite might be described as a higher law; the final measure which is the highest expression of the good may also be described as the supreme law.</div><div class="sentence"> Both these conceptions are realized chiefly by the help of the material world; and therefore when we pass into the sphere of ideas can hardly be distinguished.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span> <div class="sentence">  The four principles are required for the determination of the relative places of pleasure and wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato has been saying that we should proceed by regular steps from the one to the many.</div><div class="sentence"> Accordingly, before assigning the precedence either to good or pleasure, he must first find out and arrange in order the general principles of things.</div><div class="sentence"> Mind is ascertained to be akin to the nature of the cause, while pleasure is found in the infinite or indefinite class.</div><div class="sentence"> We may now proceed to divide pleasure and knowledge after their kinds.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span> <div class="sentence">  III.</div><div class="sentence"> 1.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato speaks of pleasure as indefinite, as relative, as a generation, and in all these points of view as in a category distinct from good.</div><div class="sentence"> For again we must repeat, that to the Greek 'the good is of the nature of the finite,' and, like virtue, either is, or is nearly allied to, knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> The modern philosopher would remark that the indefinite is equally real with the definite.</div><div class="sentence"> Health and mental qualities are in the concrete undefined; they are nevertheless real goods, and Plato rightly regards them as falling under the finite class.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, we are able to define objects or ideas, not in so far as they are in the mind, but in so far as they are manifested externally, and can therefore be reduced to rule and measure.</div><div class="sentence"> And if we adopt the test of definiteness, the pleasures of the body are more capable of being defined than any other pleasures.</div><div class="sentence"> As in art and knowledge generally, we proceed from without inwards, beginning with facts of sense, and passing to the more ideal conceptions of mental pleasure, happiness, and the like.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span> <div class="sentence">  2.</div><div class="sentence"> Pleasure is depreciated as relative, while good is exalted as absolute.</div><div class="sentence"> But this distinction seems to arise from an unfair mode of regarding them; the abstract idea of the one is compared with the concrete experience of the other.</div><div class="sentence"> For all pleasure and all knowledge may be viewed either abstracted from the mind, or in relation to the mind (compare Aristot.</div><div class="sentence"> Nic.</div><div class="sentence"> Ethics).</div><div class="sentence"> The first is an idea only, which may be conceived as absolute and unchangeable, and then the abstract idea of pleasure will be equally unchangeable with that of knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> But when we come to view either as phenomena of consciousness, the same defects are for the most part incident to both of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Our hold upon them is equally transient and uncertain; the mind cannot be always in a state of intellectual tension, any more than capable of feeling pleasure always.</div><div class="sentence"> The knowledge which is at one time clear and distinct, at another seems to fade away, just as the pleasure of health after sickness, or of eating after hunger, soon passes into a neutral state of unconsciousness and indifference.</div><div class="sentence"> Change and alternation are necessary for the mind as well as for the body; and in this is to be acknowledged, not an element of evil, but rather a law of nature.</div><div class="sentence"> The chief difference between subjective pleasure and subjective knowledge in respect of permanence is that the latter, when our feeble faculties are able to grasp it, still conveys to us an idea of unchangeableness which cannot be got rid of.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span> <div class="sentence">  4.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato attempts to identify vicious pleasures with some form of error, and insists that the term false may be applied to them: in this he appears to be carrying out in a confused manner the Socratic doctrine, that virtue is knowledge, vice ignorance.</div><div class="sentence"> He will allow of no distinction between the pleasures and the erroneous opinions on which they are founded, whether arising out of the illusion of distance or not.</div><div class="sentence"> But to this we naturally reply with Protarchus, that the pleasure is what it is, although the calculation may be false, or the after-effects painful.</div><div class="sentence"> It is difficult to acquit Plato, to use his own language, of being a 'tyro in dialectics,' when he overlooks such a distinction.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet, on the other hand, we are hardly fair judges of confusions of thought in those who view things differently from ourselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span> <div class="sentence">  5.</div><div class="sentence"> There appears also to be an incorrectness in the notion which occurs both here and in the Gorgias, of the simultaneousness of merely bodily pleasures and pains.</div><div class="sentence"> We may, perhaps, admit, though even this is not free from doubt, that the feeling of pleasureable hope or recollection is, or rather may be, simultaneous with acute bodily suffering.</div><div class="sentence"> But there is no such coexistence of the pain of thirst with the pleasures of drinking; they are not really simultaneous, for the one expels the other.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor does Plato seem to have considered that the bodily pleasures, except in certain extreme cases, are unattended with pain.</div><div class="sentence"> Few philosophers will deny that a degree of pleasure attends eating and drinking; and yet surely we might as well speak of the pains of digestion which follow, as of the pains of hunger and thirst which precede them.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato's conception is derived partly from the extreme case of a man suffering pain from hunger or thirst, partly from the image of a full and empty vessel.</div><div class="sentence"> But the truth is rather, that while the gratification of our bodily desires constantly affords some degree of pleasure, the antecedent pains are scarcely perceived by us, being almost done away with by use and regularity.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span> <div class="sentence">  6.</div><div class="sentence"> The desire to classify pleasures as accompanied or not accompanied by antecedent pains, has led Plato to place under one head the pleasures of smell and sight, as well as those derived from sounds of music and from knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> He would have done better to make a separate class of the pleasures of smell, having no association of mind, or perhaps to have divided them into natural and artificial.</div><div class="sentence"> The pleasures of sight and sound might then have been regarded as being the expression of ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> But this higher and truer point of view never appears to have occurred to Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor has he any distinction between the fine arts and the mechanical; and, neither here nor anywhere, an adequate conception of the beautiful in external things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span> <div class="sentence">  7.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato agrees partially with certain 'surly or fastidious' philosophers, as he terms them, who defined pleasure to be the absence of pain.</div><div class="sentence"> They are also described as eminent in physics.</div><div class="sentence"> There is unfortunately no school of Greek philosophy known to us which combined these two characteristics.</div><div class="sentence"> Antisthenes, who was an enemy of pleasure, was not a physical philosopher; the atomists, who were physical philosophers, were not enemies of pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet such a combination of opinions is far from being impossible.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato's omission to mention them by name has created the same uncertainty respecting them which also occurs respecting the 'friends of the ideas' and the 'materialists' in the Sophist.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span> <div class="sentence">  On the whole, this discussion is one of the least satisfactory in the dialogues of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> While the ethical nature of pleasure is scarcely considered, and the merely physical phenomenon imperfectly analysed, too much weight is given to ideas of measure and number, as the sole principle of good.</div><div class="sentence"> The comparison of pleasure and knowledge is really a comparison of two elements, which have no common measure, and which cannot be excluded from each other.</div><div class="sentence"> Feeling is not opposed to knowledge, and in all consciousness there is an element of both.</div><div class="sentence"> The most abstract kinds of knowledge are inseparable from some pleasure or pain, which accompanies the acquisition or possession of them: the student is liable to grow weary of them, and soon discovers that continuous mental energy is not granted to men.</div><div class="sentence"> The most sensual pleasure, on the other hand, is inseparable from the consciousness of pleasure; no man can be happy who, to borrow Plato's illustration, is leading the life of an oyster.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence (by his own confession) the main thesis is not worth determining; the real interest lies in the incidental discussion.</div><div class="sentence"> We can no more separate pleasure from knowledge in the Philebus than we can separate justice from happiness in the Republic.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span> <div class="sentence">  IV.</div><div class="sentence"> An interesting account is given in the Philebus of the rank and order of the sciences or arts, which agrees generally with the scheme of knowledge in the Sixth Book of the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> The chief difference is, that the position of the arts is more exactly defined.</div><div class="sentence"> They are divided into an empirical part and a scientific part, of which the first is mere guess-work, the second is determined by rule and measure.</div><div class="sentence"> Of the more empirical arts, music is given as an example; this, although affirmed to be necessary to human life, is depreciated.</div><div class="sentence"> Music is regarded from a point of view entirely opposite to that of the Republic, not as a sublime science, coordinate with astronomy, but as full of doubt and conjecture.</div><div class="sentence"> According to the standard of accuracy which is here adopted, it is rightly placed lower in the scale than carpentering, because the latter is more capable of being reduced to measure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span> <div class="sentence">  The theoretical element of the arts may also become a purely abstract science, when separated from matter, and is then said to be pure and unmixed.</div><div class="sentence"> The distinction which Plato here makes seems to be the same as that between pure and applied mathematics, and may be expressed in the modern formulaâscience is art theoretical, art is science practical.</div><div class="sentence"> In the reason which he gives for the superiority of the pure science of number over the mixed or applied, we can only agree with him in part.</div><div class="sentence"> He says that the numbers which the philosopher employs are always the same, whereas the numbers which are used in practice represent different sizes or quantities.</div><div class="sentence"> He does not see that this power of expressing different quantities by the same symbol is the characteristic and not the defect of numbers, and is due to their abstract nature;âalthough we admit of course what Plato seems to feel in his distinctions between pure and impure knowledge, that the imperfection of matter enters into the applications of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span> <div class="sentence">  Above the other sciences, as in the Republic, towers dialectic, which is the science of eternal Being, apprehended by the purest mind and reason.</div><div class="sentence"> The lower sciences, including the mathematical, are akin to opinion rather than to reason, and are placed together in the fourth class of goods.</div><div class="sentence"> The relation in which they stand to dialectic is obscure in the Republic, and is not cleared up in the Philebus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span> <div class="sentence">  V. Thus far we have only attained to the vestibule or ante-chamber of the good; for there is a good exceeding knowledge, exceeding essence, which, like Glaucon in the Republic, we find a difficulty in apprehending.</div><div class="sentence"> This good is now to be exhibited to us under various aspects and gradations.</div><div class="sentence"> The relative dignity of pleasure and knowledge has been determined; but they have not yet received their exact position in the scale of goods.</div><div class="sentence"> Some difficulties occur to us in the enumeration: First, how are we to distinguish the first from the second class of goods, or the second from the third?</div><div class="sentence"> Secondly, why is there no mention of the supreme mind?</div><div class="sentence"> Thirdly, the nature of the fourth class.</div><div class="sentence"> Fourthly, the meaning of the allusion to a sixth class, which is not further investigated.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span> <div class="sentence">  (I) Plato seems to proceed in his table of goods, from the more abstract to the less abstract; from the subjective to the objective; until at the lower end of the scale we fairly descend into the region of human action and feeling.</div><div class="sentence"> To him, the greater the abstraction the greater the truth, and he is always tending to see abstractions within abstractions; which, like the ideas in the Parmenides, are always appearing one behind another.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence we find a difficulty in following him into the sphere of thought which he is seeking to attain.</div><div class="sentence"> First in his scale of goods he places measure, in which he finds the eternal nature: this would be more naturally expressed in modern language as eternal law, and seems to be akin both to the finite and to the mind or cause, which were two of the elements in the former table.</div><div class="sentence"> Like the supreme nature in the Timaeus, like the ideal beauty in the Symposium or the Phaedrus, or like the ideal good in the Republic, this is the absolute and unapproachable being.</div><div class="sentence"> But this being is manifested in symmetry and beauty everywhere, in the order of nature and of mind, in the relations of men to one another.</div><div class="sentence"> For the word 'measure' he now substitutes the word 'symmetry,' as if intending to express measure conceived as relation.</div><div class="sentence"> He then proceeds to regard the good no longer in an objective form, but as the human reason seeking to attain truth by the aid of dialectic; such at least we naturally infer to be his meaning, when we consider that both here and in the Republic the sphere of nous or mind is assigned to dialectic.</div><div class="sentence"> (2) It is remarkable (see above) that this personal conception of mind is confined to the human mind, and not extended to the divine.</div><div class="sentence"> (3) If we may be allowed to interpret one dialogue of Plato by another, the sciences of figure and number are probably classed with the arts and true opinions, because they proceed from hypotheses (compare Republic).</div><div class="sentence"> (4) The sixth class, if a sixth class is to be added, is playfully set aside by a quotation from Orpheus: Plato means to say that a sixth class, if there be such a class, is not worth considering, because pleasure, having only gained the fifth place in the scale of goods, is already out of the running.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span> <div class="sentence">  Reasons have been already given for assigning a late date to the Philebus.</div><div class="sentence"> That the date is probably later than that of the Republic, may be further argued on the following grounds:â1.</div><div class="sentence"> The general resemblance to the later dialogues and to the Laws: 2.</div><div class="sentence"> The more complete account of the nature of good and pleasure: 3.</div><div class="sentence"> The distinction between perception, memory, recollection, and opinion which indicates a great progress in psychology; also between understanding and imagination, which is described under the figure of the scribe and the painter.</div><div class="sentence"> A superficial notion may arise that Plato probably wrote shorter dialogues, such as the Philebus, the Sophist, and the Statesman, as studies or preparations for longer ones.</div><div class="sentence"> This view may be natural; but on further reflection is seen to be fallacious, because these three dialogues are found to make an advance upon the metaphysical conceptions of the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> And we can more easily suppose that Plato composed shorter writings after longer ones, than suppose that he lost hold of further points of view which he had once attained.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span> <div class="sentence">  It is more easy to find traces of the Pythagoreans, Eleatics, Megarians, Cynics, Cyrenaics and of the ideas of Anaxagoras, in the Philebus, than to say how much is due to each of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Had we fuller records of those old philosophers, we should probably find Plato in the midst of the fray attempting to combine Eleatic and Pythagorean doctrines, and seeking to find a truth beyond either Being or number; setting up his own concrete conception of good against the abstract practical good of the Cynics, or the abstract intellectual good of the Megarians, and his own idea of classification against the denial of plurality in unity which is also attributed to them; warring against the Eristics as destructive of truth, as he had formerly fought against the Sophists; taking up a middle position between the Cynics and Cyrenaics in his doctrine of pleasure; asserting with more consistency than Anaxagoras the existence of an intelligent mind and cause.</div><div class="sentence"> Of the Heracliteans, whom he is said by Aristotle to have cultivated in his youth, he speaks in the Philebus, as in the Theaetetus and Cratylus, with irony and contempt.</div><div class="sentence"> But we have not the knowledge which would enable us to pursue further the line of reflection here indicated; nor can we expect to find perfect clearness or order in the first efforts of mankind to understand the working of their own minds.</div><div class="sentence"> The ideas which they are attempting to analyse, they are also in process of creating; the abstract universals of which they are seeking to adjust the relations have been already excluded by them from the category of relation.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span> <div class="sentence">  The Philebus, like the Cratylus, is supposed to be the continuation of a previous discussion.</div><div class="sentence"> An argument respecting the comparative claims of pleasure and wisdom to rank as the chief good has been already carried on between Philebus and Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> The argument is now transferred to Protarchus, the son of Callias, a noble Athenian youth, sprung from a family which had spent 'a world of money' on the Sophists (compare Apol.</div><div class="sentence"> ; Crat.</div><div class="sentence"> ; Protag.).</div><div class="sentence"> Philebus, who appears to be the teacher, or elder friend, and perhaps the lover, of Protarchus, takes no further part in the discussion beyond asserting in the strongest manner his adherence, under all circumstances, to the cause of pleasure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates suggests that they shall have a first and second palm of victory.</div><div class="sentence"> For there may be a good higher than either pleasure or wisdom, and then neither of them will gain the first prize, but whichever of the two is more akin to this higher good will have a right to the second.</div><div class="sentence"> They agree, and Socrates opens the game by enlarging on the diversity and opposition which exists among pleasures.</div><div class="sentence"> For there are pleasures of all kinds, good and bad, wise and foolishâpleasures of the temperate as well as of the intemperate.</div><div class="sentence"> Protarchus replies that although pleasures may be opposed in so far as they spring from opposite sources, nevertheless as pleasures they are alike.</div><div class="sentence"> Yes, retorts Socrates, pleasure is like pleasure, as figure is like figure and colour like colour; yet we all know that there is great variety among figures and colours.</div><div class="sentence"> Protarchus does not see the drift of this remark; and Socrates proceeds to ask how he can have a right to attribute a new predicate (i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> 'good') to pleasures in general, when he cannot deny that they are different?</div><div class="sentence"> What common property in all of them does he mean to indicate by the term 'good'?</div><div class="sentence"> If he continues to assert that there is some trivial sense in which pleasure is one, Socrates may retort by saying that knowledge is one, but the result will be that such merely verbal and trivial conceptions, whether of knowledge or pleasure, will spoil the discussion, and will prove the incapacity of the two disputants.</div><div class="sentence"> In order to avoid this danger, he proposes that they shall beat a retreat, and, before they proceed, come to an understanding about the 'high argument' of the one and the many.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">043</span> <div class="sentence">  Protarchus agrees to the proposal, but he is under the impression that Socrates means to discuss the common questionâhow a sensible object can be one, and yet have opposite attributes, such as 'great' and 'small,' 'light' and 'heavy,' or how there can be many members in one body, and the like wonders.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates has long ceased to see any wonder in these phenomena; his difficulties begin with the application of number to abstract unities (e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> 'man,' 'good') and with the attempt to divide them.</div><div class="sentence"> For have these unities of idea any real existence?</div><div class="sentence"> How, if imperishable, can they enter into the world of generation?</div><div class="sentence"> How, as units, can they be divided and dispersed among different objects?</div><div class="sentence"> Or do they exist in their entirety in each object?</div><div class="sentence"> These difficulties are but imperfectly answered by Socrates in what follows.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">044</span> <div class="sentence">  We speak of a one and many, which is ever flowing in and out of all things, concerning which a young man often runs wild in his first metaphysical enthusiasm, talking about analysis and synthesis to his father and mother and the neighbours, hardly sparing even his dog.</div><div class="sentence"> This 'one in many' is a revelation of the order of the world, which some Prometheus first made known to our ancestors; and they, who were better men and nearer the gods than we are, have handed it down to us.</div><div class="sentence"> To know how to proceed by regular steps from one to many, and from many to one, is just what makes the difference between eristic and dialectic.</div><div class="sentence"> And the right way of proceeding is to look for one idea or class in all things, and when you have found one to look for more than one, and for all that there are, and when you have found them all and regularly divided a particular field of knowledge into classes, you may leave the further consideration of individuals.</div><div class="sentence"> But you must not pass at once either from unity to infinity, or from infinity to unity.</div><div class="sentence"> In music, for example, you may begin with the most general notion, but this alone will not make you a musician: you must know also the number and nature of the intervals, and the systems which are framed out of them, and the rhythms of the dance which correspond to them.</div><div class="sentence"> And when you have a similar knowledge of any other subject, you may be said to know that subject.</div><div class="sentence"> In speech again there are infinite varieties of sound, and some one who was a wise man, or more than man, comprehended them all in the classes of mutes, vowels, and semivowels, and gave to each of them a name, and assigned them to the art of grammar.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates, as we learn from the Memorabilia of Xenophon, first drew attention to the consequences of actions.</div><div class="sentence"> Mankind were said by him to act rightly when they knew what they were doing, or, in the language of the Gorgias, 'did what they would.'</div><div class="sentence"> He seems to have been the first who maintained that the good was the useful (Mem.).</div><div class="sentence"> In his eagerness for generalization, seeking, as Aristotle says, for the universal in Ethics (Metaph.</div><div class="sentence"> ), he took the most obvious intellectual aspect of human action which occurred to him.</div><div class="sentence"> He meant to emphasize, not pleasure, but the calculation of pleasure; neither is he arguing that pleasure is the chief good, but that we should have a principle of choice.</div><div class="sentence"> He did not intend to oppose 'the useful' to some higher conception, such as the Platonic ideal, but to chance and caprice.</div><div class="sentence"> The Platonic Socrates pursues the same vein of thought in the Protagoras, where he argues against the so-called sophist that pleasure and pain are the final standards and motives of good and evil, and that the salvation of human life depends upon a right estimate of pleasures greater or less when seen near and at a distance.</div><div class="sentence"> The testimony of Xenophon is thus confirmed by that of Plato, and we are therefore justified in calling Socrates the first utilitarian; as indeed there is no side or aspect of philosophy which may not with reason be ascribed to himâhe is Cynic and Cyrenaic, Platonist and Aristotelian in one.</div><div class="sentence"> But in the Phaedo the Socratic has already passed into a more ideal point of view; and he, or rather Plato speaking in his person, expressly repudiates the notion that the exchange of a less pleasure for a greater can be an exchange of virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> Such virtue is the virtue of ordinary men who live in the world of appearance; they are temperate only that they may enjoy the pleasures of intemperance, and courageous from fear of danger.</div><div class="sentence"> Whereas the philosopher is seeking after wisdom and not after pleasure, whether near or distant: he is the mystic, the initiated, who has learnt to despise the body and is yearning all his life long for a truth which will hereafter be revealed to him.</div><div class="sentence"> In the Republic the pleasures of knowledge are affirmed to be superior to other pleasures, because the philosopher so estimates them; and he alone has had experience of both kinds.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare a similar argument urged by one of the latest defenders of Utilitarianism, Mill's Utilitarianism).</div><div class="sentence"> In the Philebus, Plato, although he regards the enemies of pleasure with complacency, still further modifies the transcendentalism of the Phaedo.</div><div class="sentence"> For he is compelled to confess, rather reluctantly, perhaps, that some pleasures, i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> those which have no antecedent pains, claim a place in the scale of goods.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span> <div class="sentence">  There have been many reasons why not only Plato but mankind in general have been unwilling to acknowledge that 'pleasure is the chief good.'</div><div class="sentence"> Either they have heard a voice calling to them out of another world; or the life and example of some great teacher has cast their thoughts of right and wrong in another mould; or the word 'pleasure' has been associated in their mind with merely animal enjoyment.</div><div class="sentence"> They could not believe that what they were always striving to overcome, and the power or principle in them which overcame, were of the same nature.</div><div class="sentence"> The pleasure of doing good to others and of bodily self-indulgence, the pleasures of intellect and the pleasures of sense, are so different:âWhy then should they be called by a common name?</div><div class="sentence"> Or, if the equivocal or metaphorical use of the word is justified by custom (like the use of other words which at first referred only to the body, and then by a figure have been transferred to the mind), still, why should we make an ambiguous word the corner-stone of moral philosophy?</div><div class="sentence"> To the higher thinker the Utilitarian or hedonist mode of speaking has been at variance with religion and with any higher conception both of politics and of morals.</div><div class="sentence"> It has not satisfied their imagination; it has offended their taste.</div><div class="sentence"> To elevate pleasure, 'the most fleeting of all things,' into a general idea seems to such men a contradiction.</div><div class="sentence"> They do not desire to bring down their theory to the level of their practice.</div><div class="sentence"> The simplicity of the 'greatest happiness' principle has been acceptable to philosophers, but the better part of the world has been slow to receive it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span> <div class="sentence">  Before proceeding, we may make a few admissions which will narrow the field of dispute; and we may as well leave behind a few prejudices, which intelligent opponents of Utilitarianism have by this time 'agreed to discard'.</div><div class="sentence"> We admit that Utility is coextensive with right, and that no action can be right which does not tend to the happiness of mankind; we acknowledge that a large class of actions are made right or wrong by their consequences only; we say further that mankind are not too mindful, but that they are far too regardless of consequences, and that they need to have the doctrine of utility habitually inculcated on them.</div><div class="sentence"> We recognize the value of a principle which can supply a connecting link between Ethics and Politics, and under which all human actions are or may be included.</div><div class="sentence"> The desire to promote happiness is no mean preference of expediency to right, but one of the highest and noblest motives by which human nature can be animated.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither in referring actions to the test of utility have we to make a laborious calculation, any more than in trying them by other standards of morals.</div><div class="sentence"> For long ago they have been classified sufficiently for all practical purposes by the thinker, by the legislator, by the opinion of the world.</div><div class="sentence"> Whatever may be the hypothesis on which they are explained, or which in doubtful cases may be applied to the regulation of them, we are very rarely, if ever, called upon at the moment of performing them to determine their effect upon the happiness of mankind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">074</span> <div class="sentence">  There is a theory which has been contrasted with Utility by Paley and othersâthe theory of a moral sense: Are our ideas of right and wrong innate or derived from experience?</div><div class="sentence"> This, perhaps, is another of those speculations which intelligent men might 'agree to discard.'</div><div class="sentence"> For it has been worn threadbare; and either alternative is equally consistent with a transcendental or with an eudaemonistic system of ethics, with a greatest happiness principle or with Kant's law of duty.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet to avoid misconception, what appears to be the truth about the origin of our moral ideas may be shortly summed up as follows:âTo each of us individually our moral ideas come first of all in childhood through the medium of education, from parents and teachers, assisted by the unconscious influence of language; they are impressed upon a mind which at first is like a waxen tablet, adapted to receive them; but they soon become fixed or set, and in after life are strengthened, or perhaps weakened by the force of public opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> They may be corrected and enlarged by experience, they may be reasoned about, they may be brought home to us by the circumstances of our lives, they may be intensified by imagination, by reflection, by a course of action likely to confirm them.</div><div class="sentence"> Under the influence of religious feeling or by an effort of thought, any one beginning with the ordinary rules of morality may create out of them for himself ideals of holiness and virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> They slumber in the minds of most men, yet in all of us there remains some tincture of affection, some desire of good, some sense of truth, some fear of the law.</div><div class="sentence"> Of some such state or process each individual is conscious in himself, and if he compares his own experience with that of others he will find the witness of their consciences to coincide with that of his own.</div><div class="sentence"> All of us have entered into an inheritance which we have the power of appropriating and making use of.</div><div class="sentence"> No great effort of mind is required on our part; we learn morals, as we learn to talk, instinctively, from conversing with others, in an enlightened age, in a civilized country, in a good home.</div><div class="sentence"> A well-educated child of ten years old already knows the essentials of morals: 'Thou shalt not steal,' 'thou shalt speak the truth,' 'thou shalt love thy parents,' 'thou shalt fear God.'</div><div class="sentence"> What more does he want?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span> <div class="sentence">  But whence comes this common inheritance or stock of moral ideas?</div><div class="sentence"> Their beginning, like all other beginnings of human things, is obscure, and is the least important part of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Imagine, if you will, that Society originated in the herding of brutes, in their parental instincts, in their rude attempts at self-preservation:âMan is not man in that he resembles, but in that he differs from them.</div><div class="sentence"> We must pass into another cycle of existence, before we can discover in him by any evidence accessible to us even the germs of our moral ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> In the history of the world, which viewed from within is the history of the human mind, they have been slowly created by religion, by poetry, by law, having their foundation in the natural affections and in the necessity of some degree of truth and justice in a social state; they have been deepened and enlarged by the efforts of great thinkers who have idealized and connected themâby the lives of saints and prophets who have taught and exemplified them.</div><div class="sentence"> The schools of ancient philosophy which seem so far from usâSocrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, the Epicureans, and a few modern teachers, such as Kant and Bentham, have each of them supplied 'moments' of thought to the world.</div><div class="sentence"> The life of Christ has embodied a divine love, wisdom, patience, reasonableness.</div><div class="sentence"> For his image, however imperfectly handed down to us, the modern world has received a standard more perfect in idea than the societies of ancient times, but also further removed from practice.</div><div class="sentence"> For there is certainly a greater interval between the theory and practice of Christians than between the theory and practice of the Greeks and Romans; the ideal is more above us, and the aspiration after good has often lent a strange power to evil.</div><div class="sentence"> And sometimes, as at the Reformation, or French Revolution, when the upper classes of a so-called Christian country have become corrupted by priestcraft, by casuistry, by licentiousness, by despotism, the lower have risen up and re-asserted the natural sense of religion and right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">076</span> <div class="sentence">  We may further remark that our moral ideas, as the world grows older, perhaps as we grow older ourselves, unless they have been undermined in us by false philosophy or the practice of mental analysis, or infected by the corruption of society or by some moral disorder in the individual, are constantly assuming a more natural and necessary character.</div><div class="sentence"> The habit of the mind, the opinion of the world, familiarizes them to us; and they take more and more the form of immediate intuition.</div><div class="sentence"> The moral sense comes last and not first in the order of their development, and is the instinct which we have inherited or acquired, not the nobler effort of reflection which created them and which keeps them alive.</div><div class="sentence"> We do not stop to reason about common honesty.</div><div class="sentence"> Whenever we are not blinded by self-deceit, as for example in judging the actions of others, we have no hesitation in determining what is right and wrong.</div><div class="sentence"> The principles of morality, when not at variance with some desire or worldly interest of our own, or with the opinion of the public, are hardly perceived by us; but in the conflict of reason and passion they assert their authority and are not overcome without remorse.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span> <div class="sentence">  Such is a brief outline of the history of our moral ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> We have to distinguish, first of all, the manner in which they have grown up in the world from the manner in which they have been communicated to each of us.</div><div class="sentence"> We may represent them to ourselves as flowing out of the boundless ocean of language and thought in little rills, which convey them to the heart and brain of each individual.</div><div class="sentence"> But neither must we confound the theories or aspects of morality with the origin of our moral ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> These are not the roots or 'origines' of morals, but the latest efforts of reflection, the lights in which the whole moral world has been regarded by different thinkers and successive generations of men.</div><div class="sentence"> If we ask: Which of these many theories is the true one?</div><div class="sentence"> we may answer: All of themâmoral sense, innate ideas, a priori, a posteriori notions, the philosophy of experience, the philosophy of intuitionâall of them have added something to our conception of Ethics; no one of them is the whole truth.</div><div class="sentence"> But to decide how far our ideas of morality are derived from one source or another; to determine what history, what philosophy has contributed to them; to distinguish the original, simple elements from the manifold and complex applications of them, would be a long enquiry too far removed from the question which we are now pursuing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">078</span> <div class="sentence">  Bearing in mind the distinction which we have been seeking to establish between our earliest and our most mature ideas of morality, we may now proceed to state the theory of Utility, not exactly in the words, but in the spirit of one of its ablest and most moderate supporters (Mill's Utilitarianism):â'That which alone makes actions either right or desirable is their utility, or tendency to promote the happiness of mankind, or, in other words, to increase the sum of pleasure in the world.</div><div class="sentence"> But all pleasures are not the same: they differ in quality as well as in quantity, and the pleasure which is superior in quality is incommensurable with the inferior.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither is the pleasure or happiness, which we seek, our own pleasure, but that of others,âof our family, of our country, of mankind.</div><div class="sentence"> The desire of this, and even the sacrifice of our own interest to that of other men, may become a passion to a rightly educated nature.</div><div class="sentence"> The Utilitarian finds a place in his system for this virtue and for every other.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">079</span> <div class="sentence">  Good or happiness or pleasure is thus regarded as the true and only end of human life.</div><div class="sentence"> To this all our desires will be found to tend, and in accordance with this all the virtues, including justice, may be explained.</div><div class="sentence"> Admitting that men rest for a time in inferior ends, and do not cast their eyes beyond them, these ends are really dependent on the greater end of happiness, and would not be pursued, unless in general they had been found to lead to it.</div><div class="sentence"> The existence of such an end is proved, as in Aristotle's time, so in our own, by the universal fact that men desire it.</div><div class="sentence"> The obligation to promote it is based upon the social nature of man; this sense of duty is shared by all of us in some degree, and is capable of being greatly fostered and strengthened.</div><div class="sentence"> So far from being inconsistent with religion, the greatest happiness principle is in the highest degree agreeable to it.</div><div class="sentence"> For what can be more reasonable than that God should will the happiness of all his creatures?</div><div class="sentence"> and in working out their happiness we may be said to be 'working together with him.'</div><div class="sentence"> Nor is it inconceivable that a new enthusiasm of the future, far stronger than any old religion, may be based upon such a conception.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span> <div class="sentence">  But then for the familiar phrase of the 'greatest happiness principle,' it seems as if we ought now to read 'the noblest happiness principle,' 'the happiness of others principle'âthe principle not of the greatest, but of the highest pleasure, pursued with no more regard to our own immediate interest than is required by the law of self-preservation.</div><div class="sentence"> Transfer the thought of happiness to another life, dropping the external circumstances which form so large a part of our idea of happiness in this, and the meaning of the word becomes indistinguishable from holiness, harmony, wisdom, love.</div><div class="sentence"> By the slight addition 'of others,' all the associations of the word are altered; we seem to have passed over from one theory of morals to the opposite.</div><div class="sentence"> For allowing that the happiness of others is reflected on ourselves, and also that every man must live before he can do good to others, still the last limitation is a very trifling exception, and the happiness of another is very far from compensating for the loss of our own.</div><div class="sentence"> According to Mr. Mill, he would best carry out the principle of utility who sacrificed his own pleasure most to that of his fellow-men.</div><div class="sentence"> But if so, Hobbes and Butler, Shaftesbury and Hume, are not so far apart as they and their followers imagine.</div><div class="sentence"> The thought of self and the thought of others are alike superseded in the more general notion of the happiness of mankind at large.</div><div class="sentence"> But in this composite good, until society becomes perfected, the friend of man himself has generally the least share, and may be a great sufferer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">081</span> <div class="sentence">  And now what objection have we to urge against a system of moral philosophy so beneficent, so enlightened, so ideal, and at the same time so practical,âso Christian, as we may say without exaggeration,âand which has the further advantage of resting morality on a principle intelligible to all capacities?</div><div class="sentence"> Have we not found that which Socrates and Plato 'grew old in seeking'?</div><div class="sentence"> Are we not desirous of happiness, at any rate for ourselves and our friends, if not for all mankind?</div><div class="sentence"> If, as is natural, we begin by thinking of ourselves first, we are easily led on to think of others; for we cannot help acknowledging that what is right for us is the right and inheritance of others.</div><div class="sentence"> We feel the advantage of an abstract principle wide enough and strong enough to override all the particularisms of mankind; which acknowledges a universal good, truth, right; which is capable of inspiring men like a passion, and is the symbol of a cause for which they are ready to contend to their life's end.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">082</span> <div class="sentence">  And if we test this principle by the lives of its professors, it would certainly appear inferior to none as a rule of action.</div><div class="sentence"> From the days of Eudoxus (Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Ethics) and Epicurus to our own, the votaries of pleasure have gained belief for their principles by their practice.</div><div class="sentence"> Two of the noblest and most disinterested men who have lived in this century, Bentham and J. S. Mill, whose lives were a long devotion to the service of their fellows, have been among the most enthusiastic supporters of utility; while among their contemporaries, some who were of a more mystical turn of mind, have ended rather in aspiration than in action, and have been found unequal to the duties of life.</div><div class="sentence"> Looking back on them now that they are removed from the scene, we feel that mankind has been the better for them.</div><div class="sentence"> The world was against them while they lived; but this is rather a reason for admiring than for depreciating them.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor can any one doubt that the influence of their philosophy on politicsâespecially on foreign politics, on law, on social life, has been upon the whole beneficial.</div><div class="sentence"> Nevertheless, they will never have justice done to them, for they do not agree either with the better feeling of the multitude or with the idealism of more refined thinkers.</div><div class="sentence"> Without Bentham, a great word in the history of philosophy would have remained unspoken.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet to this day it is rare to hear his name received with any mark of respect such as would be freely granted to the ambiguous memory of some father of the Church.</div><div class="sentence"> The odium which attached to him when alive has not been removed by his death.</div><div class="sentence"> For he shocked his contemporaries by egotism and want of taste; and this generation which has reaped the benefit of his labours has inherited the feeling of the last.</div><div class="sentence"> He was before his own age, and is hardly remembered in this.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">083</span> <div class="sentence">  While acknowledging the benefits which the greatest happiness principle has conferred upon mankind, the time appears to have arrived, not for denying its claims, but for criticizing them and comparing them with other principles which equally claim to lie at the foundation of ethics.</div><div class="sentence"> Any one who adds a general principle to knowledge has been a benefactor to the world.</div><div class="sentence"> But there is a danger that, in his first enthusiasm, he may not recognize the proportions or limitations to which his truth is subjected; he does not see how far he has given birth to a truism, or how that which is a truth to him is a truism to the rest of the world; or may degenerate in the next generation.</div><div class="sentence"> He believes that to be the whole which is only a part,âto be the necessary foundation which is really only a valuable aspect of the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> The systems of all philosophers require the criticism of 'the morrow,' when the heat of imagination which forged them has cooled, and they are seen in the temperate light of day.</div><div class="sentence"> All of them have contributed to enrich the mind of the civilized world; none of them occupy that supreme or exclusive place which their authors would have assigned to them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">084</span> <div class="sentence">  We may preface the criticism with a few preliminary remarks:â</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">085</span> <div class="sentence">  Mr. Mill, Mr. Austin, and others, in their eagerness to maintain the doctrine of utility, are fond of repeating that we are in a lamentable state of uncertainty about morals.</div><div class="sentence"> While other branches of knowledge have made extraordinary progress, in moral philosophy we are supposed by them to be no better than children, and with few exceptionsâthat is to say, Bentham and his followersâto be no further advanced than men were in the age of Socrates and Plato, who, in their turn, are deemed to be as backward in ethics as they necessarily were in physics.</div><div class="sentence"> But this, though often asserted, is recanted almost in a breath by the same writers who speak thus depreciatingly of our modern ethical philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> For they are the first to acknowledge that we have not now to begin classifying actions under the head of utility; they would not deny that about the general conceptions of morals there is a practical agreement.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no more doubt that falsehood is wrong than that a stone falls to the ground, although the first does not admit of the same ocular proof as the second.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no greater uncertainty about the duty of obedience to parents and to the law of the land than about the properties of triangles.</div><div class="sentence"> Unless we are looking for a new moral world which has no marrying and giving in marriage, there is no greater disagreement in theory about the right relations of the sexes than about the composition of water.</div><div class="sentence"> These and a few other simple principles, as they have endless applications in practice, so also may be developed in theory into counsels of perfection.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">086</span> <div class="sentence">  To what then is to be attributed this opinion which has been often entertained about the uncertainty of morals?</div><div class="sentence"> Chiefly to this,âthat philosophers have not always distinguished the theoretical and the casuistical uncertainty of morals from the practical certainty.</div><div class="sentence"> There is an uncertainty about details,âwhether, for example, under given circumstances such and such a moral principle is to be enforced, or whether in some cases there may not be a conflict of duties: these are the exceptions to the ordinary rules of morality, important, indeed, but not extending to the one thousandth or one ten-thousandth part of human actions.</div><div class="sentence"> This is the domain of casuistry.</div><div class="sentence"> Secondly, the aspects under which the most general principles of morals may be presented to us are many and various.</div><div class="sentence"> The mind of man has been more than usually active in thinking about man.</div><div class="sentence"> The conceptions of harmony, happiness, right, freedom, benevolence, self-love, have all of them seemed to some philosopher or other the truest and most comprehensive expression of morality.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no difference, or at any rate no great difference, of opinion about the right and wrong of actions, but only about the general notion which furnishes the best explanation or gives the most comprehensive view of them.</div><div class="sentence"> This, in the language of Kant, is the sphere of the metaphysic of ethics.</div><div class="sentence"> But these two uncertainties at either end, en tois malista katholou and en tois kath ekasta, leave space enough for an intermediate principle which is practically certain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span> <div class="sentence">  The rule of human life is not dependent on the theories of philosophers: we know what our duties are for the most part before we speculate about them.</div><div class="sentence"> And the use of speculation is not to teach us what we already know, but to inspire in our minds an interest about morals in general, to strengthen our conception of the virtues by showing that they confirm one another, to prove to us, as Socrates would have said, that they are not many, but one.</div><div class="sentence"> There is the same kind of pleasure and use in reducing morals, as in reducing physics, to a few very simple truths.</div><div class="sentence"> And not unfrequently the more general principle may correct prejudices and misconceptions, and enable us to regard our fellow-men in a larger and more generous spirit.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">088</span> <div class="sentence">  The two qualities which seem to be most required in first principles of ethics are, (1) that they should afford a real explanation of the facts, (2) that they should inspire the mind,âshould harmonize, strengthen, settle us.</div><div class="sentence"> We can hardly estimate the influence which a simple principle such as 'Act so as to promote the happiness of mankind,' or 'Act so that the rule on which thou actest may be adopted as a law by all rational beings,' may exercise on the mind of an individual.</div><div class="sentence"> They will often seem to open a new world to him, like the religious conceptions of faith or the spirit of God.</div><div class="sentence"> The difficulties of ethics disappear when we do not suffer ourselves to be distracted between different points of view.</div><div class="sentence"> But to maintain their hold on us, the general principles must also be psychologically trueâthey must agree with our experience, they must accord with the habits of our minds.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span> <div class="sentence">  When we are told that actions are right or wrong only in so far as they tend towards happiness, we naturally ask what is meant by 'happiness.'</div><div class="sentence"> For the term in the common use of language is only to a certain extent commensurate with moral good and evil.</div><div class="sentence"> We should hardly say that a good man could be utterly miserable (Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Ethics), or place a bad man in the first rank of happiness.</div><div class="sentence"> But yet, from various circumstances, the measure of a man's happiness may be out of all proportion to his desert.</div><div class="sentence"> And if we insist on calling the good man alone happy, we shall be using the term in some new and transcendental sense, as synonymous with well-being.</div><div class="sentence"> We have already seen that happiness includes the happiness of others as well as our own; we must now comprehend unconscious as well as conscious happiness under the same word.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no harm in this extension of the meaning, but a word which admits of such an extension can hardly be made the basis of a philosophical system.</div><div class="sentence"> The exactness which is required in philosophy will not allow us to comprehend under the same term two ideas so different as the subjective feeling of pleasure or happiness and the objective reality of a state which receives our moral approval.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span> <div class="sentence">  Like Protarchus in the Philebus, we can give no answer to the question, 'What is that common quality which in all states of human life we call happiness?</div><div class="sentence"> which includes the lower and the higher kind of happiness, and is the aim of the noblest, as well as of the meanest of mankind?'</div><div class="sentence"> If we say 'Not pleasure, not virtue, not wisdom, nor yet any quality which we can abstract from these'âwhat then?</div><div class="sentence"> After seeming to hover for a time on the verge of a great truth, we have gained only a truism.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span> <div class="sentence">  Let us ask the question in another form.</div><div class="sentence"> What is that which constitutes happiness, over and above the several ingredients of health, wealth, pleasure, virtue, knowledge, which are included under it?</div><div class="sentence"> Perhaps we answer, 'The subjective feeling of them.'</div><div class="sentence"> But this is very far from being coextensive with right.</div><div class="sentence"> Or we may reply that happiness is the whole of which the above-mentioned are the parts.</div><div class="sentence"> Still the question recurs, 'In what does the whole differ from all the parts?'</div><div class="sentence"> And if we are unable to distinguish them, happiness will be the mere aggregate of the goods of life.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, while admitting that in all right action there is an element of happiness, we cannot help seeing that the utilitarian theory supplies a much easier explanation of some virtues than of others.</div><div class="sentence"> Of many patriotic or benevolent actions we can give a straightforward account by their tendency to promote happiness.</div><div class="sentence"> For the explanation of justice, on the other hand, we have to go a long way round.</div><div class="sentence"> No man is indignant with a thief because he has not promoted the greatest happiness of the greatest number, but because he has done him a wrong.</div><div class="sentence"> There is an immeasurable interval between a crime against property or life, and the omission of an act of charity or benevolence.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet of this interval the utilitarian theory takes no cognizance.</div><div class="sentence"> The greatest happiness principle strengthens our sense of positive duties towards others, but weakens our recognition of their rights.</div><div class="sentence"> To promote in every way possible the happiness of others may be a counsel of perfection, but hardly seems to offer any ground for a theory of obligation.</div><div class="sentence"> For admitting that our ideas of obligation are partly derived from religion and custom, yet they seem also to contain other essential elements which cannot be explained by the tendency of actions to promote happiness.</div><div class="sentence"> Whence comes the necessity of them?</div><div class="sentence"> Why are some actions rather than others which equally tend to the happiness of mankind imposed upon us with the authority of law?</div><div class="sentence"> 'You ought' and 'you had better' are fundamental distinctions in human thought; and having such distinctions, why should we seek to efface and unsettle them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">093</span> <div class="sentence">  Bentham and Mr. Mill are earnest in maintaining that happiness includes the happiness of others as well as of ourselves.</div><div class="sentence"> But what two notions can be more opposed in many cases than these?</div><div class="sentence"> Granting that in a perfect state of the world my own happiness and that of all other men would coincide, in the imperfect state they often diverge, and I cannot truly bridge over the difficulty by saying that men will always find pleasure in sacrificing themselves or in suffering for others.</div><div class="sentence"> Upon the greatest happiness principle it is admitted that I am to have a share, and in consistency I should pursue my own happiness as impartially as that of my neighbour.</div><div class="sentence"> But who can decide what proportion should be mine and what his, except on the principle that I am most likely to be deceived in my own favour, and had therefore better give the larger share, if not all, to him?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span> <div class="sentence">  Further, it is admitted that utility and right coincide, not in particular instances, but in classes of actions.</div><div class="sentence"> But is it not distracting to the conscience of a man to be told that in the particular case they are opposed?</div><div class="sentence"> Happiness is said to be the ground of moral obligation, yet he must not do what clearly conduces to his own happiness if it is at variance with the good of the whole.</div><div class="sentence"> Nay, further, he will be taught that when utility and right are in apparent conflict any amount of utility does not alter by a hair's-breadth the morality of actions, which cannot be allowed to deviate from established law or usage; and that the non-detection of an immoral act, say of telling a lie, which may often make the greatest difference in the consequences, not only to himself, but to all the world, makes none whatever in the act itself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, if we are concerned not with particular actions but with classes of actions, is the tendency of actions to happiness a principle upon which we can classify them?</div><div class="sentence"> There is a universal law which imperatively declares certain acts to be right or wrong:âcan there be any universality in the law which measures actions by their tendencies towards happiness?</div><div class="sentence"> For an act which is the cause of happiness to one person may be the cause of unhappiness to another; or an act which if performed by one person may increase the happiness of mankind may have the opposite effect if performed by another.</div><div class="sentence"> Right can never be wrong, or wrong right, that there are no actions which tend to the happiness of mankind which may not under other circumstances tend to their unhappiness.</div><div class="sentence"> Unless we say not only that all right actions tend to happiness, but that they tend to happiness in the same degree in which they are right (and in that case the word 'right' is plainer), we weaken the absoluteness of our moral standard; we reduce differences in kind to differences in degree; we obliterate the stamp which the authority of ages has set upon vice and crime.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span> <div class="sentence">  Once more: turning from theory to practice we feel the importance of retaining the received distinctions of morality.</div><div class="sentence"> Words such as truth, justice, honesty, virtue, love, have a simple meaning; they have become sacred to us,â'the word of God' written on the human heart: to no other words can the same associations be attached.</div><div class="sentence"> We cannot explain them adequately on principles of utility; in attempting to do so we rob them of their true character.</div><div class="sentence"> We give them a meaning often paradoxical and distorted, and generally weaker than their signification in common language.</div><div class="sentence"> And as words influence men's thoughts, we fear that the hold of morality may also be weakened, and the sense of duty impaired, if virtue and vice are explained only as the qualities which do or do not contribute to the pleasure of the world.</div><div class="sentence"> In that very expression we seem to detect a false ring, for pleasure is individual not universal; we speak of eternal and immutable justice, but not of eternal and immutable pleasure; nor by any refinement can we avoid some taint of bodily sense adhering to the meaning of the word.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span> <div class="sentence">  Again: the higher the view which men take of life, the more they lose sight of their own pleasure or interest.</div><div class="sentence"> True religion is not working for a reward only, but is ready to work equally without a reward.</div><div class="sentence"> It is not 'doing the will of God for the sake of eternal happiness,' but doing the will of God because it is best, whether rewarded or unrewarded.</div><div class="sentence"> And this applies to others as well as to ourselves.</div><div class="sentence"> For he who sacrifices himself for the good of others, does not sacrifice himself that they may be saved from the persecution which he endures for their sakes, but rather that they in their turn may be able to undergo similar sufferings, and like him stand fast in the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> To promote their happiness is not his first object, but to elevate their moral nature.</div><div class="sentence"> Both in his own case and that of others there may be happiness in the distance, but if there were no happiness he would equally act as he does.</div><div class="sentence"> We are speaking of the highest and noblest natures; and a passing thought naturally arises in our minds, 'Whether that can be the first principle of morals which is hardly regarded in their own case by the greatest benefactors of mankind?'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">098</span> <div class="sentence">  The admissions that pleasures differ in kind, and that actions are already classified; the acknowledgment that happiness includes the happiness of others, as well as of ourselves; the confusion (not made by Aristotle) between conscious and unconscious happiness, or between happiness the energy and happiness the result of the energy, introduce uncertainty and inconsistency into the whole enquiry.</div><div class="sentence"> We reason readily and cheerfully from a greatest happiness principle.</div><div class="sentence"> But we find that utilitarians do not agree among themselves about the meaning of the word.</div><div class="sentence"> Still less can they impart to others a common conception or conviction of the nature of happiness.</div><div class="sentence"> The meaning of the word is always insensibly slipping away from us, into pleasure, out of pleasure, now appearing as the motive, now as the test of actions, and sometimes varying in successive sentences.</div><div class="sentence"> And as in a mathematical demonstration an error in the original number disturbs the whole calculation which follows, this fundamental uncertainty about the word vitiates all the applications of it.</div><div class="sentence"> Must we not admit that a notion so uncertain in meaning, so void of content, so at variance with common language and opinion, does not comply adequately with either of our two requirements?</div><div class="sentence"> It can neither strike the imaginative faculty, nor give an explanation of phenomena which is in accordance with our individual experience.</div><div class="sentence"> It is indefinite; it supplies only a partial account of human actions: it is one among many theories of philosophers.</div><div class="sentence"> It may be compared with other notions, such as the chief good of Plato, which may be best expressed to us under the form of a harmony, or with Kant's obedience to law, which may be summed up under the word 'duty,' or with the Stoical 'Follow nature,' and seems to have no advantage over them.</div><div class="sentence"> All of these present a certain aspect of moral truth.</div><div class="sentence"> None of them are, or indeed profess to be, the only principle of morals.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span> <div class="sentence">  And this brings us to speak of the most serious objection to the utilitarian systemâits exclusiveness.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no place for Kant or Hegel, for Plato and Aristotle alongside of it.</div><div class="sentence"> They do not reject the greatest happiness principle, but it rejects them.</div><div class="sentence"> Now the phenomena of moral action differ, and some are best explained upon one principle and some upon another: the virtue of justice seems to be naturally connected with one theory of morals, the virtues of temperance and benevolence with another.</div><div class="sentence"> The characters of men also differ; and some are more attracted by one aspect of the truth, some by another.</div><div class="sentence"> The firm stoical nature will conceive virtue under the conception of law, the philanthropist under that of doing good, the quietist under that of resignation, the enthusiast under that of faith or love.</div><div class="sentence"> The upright man of the world will desire above all things that morality should be plain and fixed, and should use language in its ordinary sense.</div><div class="sentence"> Persons of an imaginative temperament will generally be dissatisfied with the words 'utility' or 'pleasure': their principle of right is of a far higher characterâwhat or where to be found they cannot always distinctly tell;âdeduced from the laws of human nature, says one; resting on the will of God, says another; based upon some transcendental idea which animates more worlds than one, says a third:</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">100</span> <div class="sentence">  To satisfy an imaginative nature in any degree, the doctrine of utility must be so transfigured that it becomes altogether different and loses all simplicity.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span> <div class="sentence">  But why, since there are different characters among men, should we not allow them to envisage morality accordingly, and be thankful to the great men who have provided for all of us modes and instruments of thought?</div><div class="sentence"> Would the world have been better if there had been no Stoics or Kantists, no Platonists or Cartesians?</div><div class="sentence"> No more than if the other pole of moral philosophy had been excluded.</div><div class="sentence"> All men have principles which are above their practice; they admit premises which, if carried to their conclusions, are a sufficient basis of morals.</div><div class="sentence"> In asserting liberty of speculation we are not encouraging individuals to make right or wrong for themselves, but only conceding that they may choose the form under which they prefer to contemplate them.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor do we say that one of these aspects is as true and good as another; but that they all of them, if they are not mere sophisms and illusions, define and bring into relief some part of the truth which would have been obscure without their light.</div><div class="sentence"> Why should we endeavour to bind all men within the limits of a single metaphysical conception?</div><div class="sentence"> The necessary imperfection of language seems to require that we should view the same truth under more than one aspect.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span> <div class="sentence">  We are living in the second age of utilitarianism, when the charm of novelty and the fervour of the first disciples has passed away.</div><div class="sentence"> The doctrine is no longer stated in the forcible paradoxical manner of Bentham, but has to be adapted to meet objections; its corners are rubbed off, and the meaning of its most characteristic expressions is softened.</div><div class="sentence"> The array of the enemy melts away when we approach him.</div><div class="sentence"> The greatest happiness of the greatest number was a great original idea when enunciated by Bentham, which leavened a generation and has left its mark on thought and civilization in all succeeding times.</div><div class="sentence"> His grasp of it had the intensity of genius.</div><div class="sentence"> In the spirit of an ancient philosopher he would have denied that pleasures differed in kind, or that by happiness he meant anything but pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> He would perhaps have revolted us by his thoroughness.</div><div class="sentence"> The 'guardianship of his doctrine' has passed into other hands; and now we seem to see its weak points, its ambiguities, its want of exactness while assuming the highest exactness, its one-sidedness, its paradoxical explanation of several of the virtues.</div><div class="sentence"> No philosophy has ever stood this criticism of the next generation, though the founders of all of them have imagined that they were built upon a rock.</div><div class="sentence"> And the utilitarian system, like others, has yielded to the inevitable analysis.</div><div class="sentence"> Even in the opinion of 'her admirers she has been terribly damaged' (Phil.</div><div class="sentence"> ), and is no longer the only moral philosophy, but one among many which have contributed in various degrees to the intellectual progress of mankind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">103</span> <div class="sentence">  But because the utilitarian philosophy can no longer claim 'the prize,' we must not refuse to acknowledge the great benefits conferred by it on the world.</div><div class="sentence"> All philosophies are refuted in their turn, says the sceptic, and he looks forward to all future systems sharing the fate of the past.</div><div class="sentence"> All philosophies remain, says the thinker; they have done a great work in their own day, and they supply posterity with aspects of the truth and with instruments of thought.</div><div class="sentence"> Though they may be shorn of their glory, they retain their place in the organism of knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span> <div class="sentence">  And still there remain many rules of morals which are better explained and more forcibly inculcated on the principle of utility than on any other.</div><div class="sentence"> The question Will such and such an action promote the happiness of myself, my family, my country, the world?</div><div class="sentence"> may check the rising feeling of pride or honour which would cause a quarrel, an estrangement, a war.</div><div class="sentence"> 'How can I contribute to the greatest happiness of others?'</div><div class="sentence"> is another form of the question which will be more attractive to the minds of many than a deduction of the duty of benevolence from a priori principles.</div><div class="sentence"> In politics especially hardly any other argument can be allowed to have weight except the happiness of a people.</div><div class="sentence"> All parties alike profess to aim at this, which though often used only as the disguise of self-interest has a great and real influence on the minds of statesmen.</div><div class="sentence"> In religion, again, nothing can more tend to mitigate superstition than the belief that the good of man is also the will of God.</div><div class="sentence"> This is an easy test to which the prejudices and superstitions of men may be brought:âwhatever does not tend to the good of men is not of God.</div><div class="sentence"> And the ideal of the greatest happiness of mankind, especially if believed to be the will of God, when compared with the actual fact, will be one of the strongest motives to do good to others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span> <div class="sentence">  On the other hand, when the temptation is to speak falsely, to be dishonest or unjust, or in any way to interfere with the rights of others, the argument that these actions regarded as a class will not conduce to the happiness of mankind, though true enough, seems to have less force than the feeling which is already implanted in the mind by conscience and authority.</div><div class="sentence"> To resolve this feeling into the greatest happiness principle takes away from its sacred and authoritative character.</div><div class="sentence"> The martyr will not go to the stake in order that he may promote the happiness of mankind, but for the sake of the truth: neither will the soldier advance to the cannon's mouth merely because he believes military discipline to be for the good of mankind.</div><div class="sentence"> It is better for him to know that he will be shot, that he will be disgraced, if he runs awayâhe has no need to look beyond military honour, patriotism, 'England expects every man to do his duty.'</div><div class="sentence"> These are stronger motives than the greatest happiness of the greatest number, which is the thesis of a philosopher, not the watchword of an army.</div><div class="sentence"> For in human actions men do not always require broad principles; duties often come home to us more when they are limited and defined, and sanctioned by custom and public opinion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span> <div class="sentence">  Lastly, if we turn to the history of ethics, we shall find that our moral ideas have originated not in utility but in religion, in law, in conceptions of nature, of an ideal good, and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> And many may be inclined to think that this conclusively disproves the claim of utility to be the basis of morals.</div><div class="sentence"> But the utilitarian will fairly reply (see above) that we must distinguish the origin of ethics from the principles of themâthe historical germ from the later growth of reflection.</div><div class="sentence"> And he may also truly add that for two thousand years and more, utility, if not the originating, has been the great corrective principle in law, in politics, in religion, leading men to ask how evil may be diminished and good increasedâby what course of policy the public interest may be promoted, and to understand that God wills the happiness, not of some of his creatures and in this world only, but of all of them and in every stage of their existence.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span> <div class="sentence">  'What is the place of happiness or utility in a system of moral philosophy?'</div><div class="sentence"> is analogous to the question asked in the Philebus, 'What rank does pleasure hold in the scale of goods?'</div><div class="sentence"> Admitting the greatest happiness principle to be true and valuable, and the necessary foundation of that part of morals which relates to the consequences of actions, we still have to consider whether this or some other general notion is the highest principle of human life.</div><div class="sentence"> We may try them in this comparison by three testsâdefiniteness, comprehensiveness, and motive power.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span> <div class="sentence">  There are three subjective principles of morals,âsympathy, benevolence, self-love.</div><div class="sentence"> But sympathy seems to rest morality on feelings which differ widely even in good men; benevolence and self-love torture one half of our virtuous actions into the likeness of the other.</div><div class="sentence"> The greatest happiness principle, which includes both, has the advantage over all these in comprehensiveness, but the advantage is purchased at the expense of definiteness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">109</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, there are the legal and political principles of moralsâfreedom, equality, rights of persons; 'Every man to count for one and no man for more than one,' 'Every man equal in the eye of the law and of the legislator.'</div><div class="sentence"> There is also the other sort of political morality, which if not beginning with 'Might is right,' at any rate seeks to deduce our ideas of justice from the necessities of the state and of society.</div><div class="sentence"> According to this view the greatest good of men is obedience to law: the best human government is a rational despotism, and the best idea which we can form of a divine being is that of a despot acting not wholly without regard to law and order.</div><div class="sentence"> To such a view the present mixed state of the world, not wholly evil or wholly good, is supposed to be a witness.</div><div class="sentence"> More we might desire to have, but are not permitted.</div><div class="sentence"> Though a human tyrant would be intolerable, a divine tyrant is a very tolerable governor of the universe.</div><div class="sentence"> This is the doctrine of Thrasymachus adapted to the public opinion of modern times.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span> <div class="sentence">  There is yet a third view which combines the two:âfreedom is obedience to the law, and the greatest order is also the greatest freedom; 'Act so that thy action may be the law of every intelligent being.'</div><div class="sentence"> This view is noble and elevating; but it seems to err, like other transcendental principles of ethics, in being too abstract.</div><div class="sentence"> For there is the same difficulty in connecting the idea of duty with particular duties as in bridging the gulf between phainomena and onta; and when, as in the system of Kant, this universal idea or law is held to be independent of space and time, such a mataion eidos becomes almost unmeaning.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">111</span> <div class="sentence">  Once more there are the religious principles of morals:âthe will of God revealed in Scripture and in nature.</div><div class="sentence"> No philosophy has supplied a sanction equal in authority to this, or a motive equal in strength to the belief in another life.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet about these too we must ask What will of God?</div><div class="sentence"> how revealed to us, and by what proofs?</div><div class="sentence"> Religion, like happiness, is a word which has great influence apart from any consideration of its content: it may be for great good or for great evil.</div><div class="sentence"> But true religion is the synthesis of religion and morality, beginning with divine perfection in which all human perfection is embodied.</div><div class="sentence"> It moves among ideas of holiness, justice, love, wisdom, truth; these are to God, in whom they are personified, what the Platonic ideas are to the idea of good.</div><div class="sentence"> It is the consciousness of the will of God that all men should be as he is.</div><div class="sentence"> It lives in this world and is known to us only through the phenomena of this world, but it extends to worlds beyond.</div><div class="sentence"> Ordinary religion which is alloyed with motives of this world may easily be in excess, may be fanatical, may be interested, may be the mask of ambition, may be perverted in a thousand ways.</div><div class="sentence"> But of that religion which combines the will of God with our highest ideas of truth and right there can never be too much.</div><div class="sentence"> This impossibility of excess is the note of divine moderation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">112</span> <div class="sentence">  So then, having briefly passed in review the various principles of moral philosophy, we may now arrange our goods in order, though, like the reader of the Philebus, we have a difficulty in distinguishing the different aspects of them from one another, or defining the point at which the human passes into the divine.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">113</span> <div class="sentence">  First, the eternal will of God in this world and in another,âjustice, holiness, wisdom, love, without succession of acts (ouch e genesis prosestin), which is known to us in part only, and reverenced by us as divine perfection.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">114</span> <div class="sentence">  Secondly, human perfection, or the fulfilment of the will of God in this world, and co-operation with his laws revealed to us by reason and experience, in nature, history, and in our own minds.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">115</span> <div class="sentence">  Thirdly, the elements of human perfection,âvirtue, knowledge, and right opinion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">116</span> <div class="sentence">  Fourthly, the external conditions of perfection,âhealth and the goods of life.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">117</span> <div class="sentence">  Fifthly, beauty and happiness,âthe inward enjoyment of that which is best and fairest in this world and in the human soul.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">118</span> <div class="sentence">  ...</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">119</span> <div class="sentence">  The Philebus is probably the latest in time of the writings of Plato with the exception of the Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> We have in it therefore the last development of his philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> The extreme and one-sided doctrines of the Cynics and Cyrenaics are included in a larger whole; the relations of pleasure and knowledge to each other and to the good are authoritatively determined; the Eleatic Being and the Heraclitean Flux no longer divide the empire of thought; the Mind of Anaxagoras has become the Mind of God and of the World.</div><div class="sentence"> The great distinction between pure and applied science for the first time has a place in philosophy; the natural claim of dialectic to be the Queen of the Sciences is once more affirmed.</div><div class="sentence"> This latter is the bond of union which pervades the whole or nearly the whole of the Platonic writings.</div><div class="sentence"> And here as in several other dialogues (Phaedrus, Republic, etc.)</div><div class="sentence"> it is presented to us in a manner playful yet also serious, and sometimes as if the thought of it were too great for human utterance and came down from heaven direct.</div><div class="sentence"> It is the organization of knowledge wonderful to think of at a time when knowledge itself could hardly be said to exist.</div><div class="sentence"> It is this more than any other element which distinguishes Plato, not only from the presocratic philosophers, but from Socrates himself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">120</span> <div class="sentence">  We have not yet reached the confines of Aristotle, but we make a somewhat nearer approach to him in the Philebus than in the earlier Platonic writings.</div><div class="sentence"> The germs of logic are beginning to appear, but they are not collected into a whole, or made a separate science or system.</div><div class="sentence"> Many thinkers of many different schools have to be interposed between the Parmenides or Philebus of Plato, and the Physics or Metaphysics of Aristotle.</div><div class="sentence"> It is this interval upon which we have to fix our minds if we would rightly understand the character of the transition from one to the other.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato and Aristotle do not dovetail into one another; nor does the one begin where the other ends; there is a gulf between them not to be measured by time, which in the fragmentary state of our knowledge it is impossible to bridge over.</div><div class="sentence"> It follows that the one cannot be interpreted by the other.</div><div class="sentence"> At any rate, it is not Plato who is to be interpreted by Aristotle, but Aristotle by Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> Of all philosophy and of all art the true understanding is to be sought not in the afterthoughts of posterity, but in the elements out of which they have arisen.</div><div class="sentence"> For the previous stage is a tendency towards the ideal at which they are aiming; the later is a declination or deviation from them, or even a perversion of them.</div><div class="sentence"> No man's thoughts were ever so well expressed by his disciples as by himself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">121</span> <div class="sentence">  But although Plato in the Philebus does not come into any close connexion with Aristotle, he is now a long way from himself and from the beginnings of his own philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> At the time of his death he left his system still incomplete; or he may be more truly said to have had no system, but to have lived in the successive stages or moments of metaphysical thought which presented themselves from time to time.</div><div class="sentence"> The earlier discussions about universal ideas and definitions seem to have died away; the correlation of ideas has taken their place.</div><div class="sentence"> The flowers of rhetoric and poetry have lost their freshness and charm; and a technical language has begun to supersede and overgrow them.</div><div class="sentence"> But the power of thinking tends to increase with age, and the experience of life to widen and deepen.</div><div class="sentence"> The good is summed up under categories which are not summa genera, but heads or gradations of thought.</div><div class="sentence"> The question of pleasure and the relation of bodily pleasures to mental, which is hardly treated of elsewhere in Plato, is here analysed with great subtlety.</div><div class="sentence"> The mean or measure is now made the first principle of good.</div><div class="sentence"> Some of these questions reappear in Aristotle, as does also the distinction between metaphysics and mathematics.</div><div class="sentence"> But there are many things in Plato which have been lost in Aristotle; and many things in Aristotle not to be found in Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> The most remarkable deficiency in Aristotle is the disappearance of the Platonic dialectic, which in the Aristotelian school is only used in a comparatively unimportant and trivial sense.</div><div class="sentence"> The most remarkable additions are the invention of the Syllogism, the conception of happiness as the foundation of morals, the reference of human actions to the standard of the better mind of the world, or of the one 'sensible man' or 'superior person.'</div><div class="sentence"> His conception of ousia, or essence, is not an advance upon Plato, but a return to the poor and meagre abstractions of the Eleatic philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> The dry attempt to reduce the presocratic philosophy by his own rather arbitrary standard of the four causes, contrasts unfavourably with Plato's general discussion of the same subject (Sophist).</div><div class="sentence"> To attempt further to sum up the differences between the two great philosophers would be out of place here.</div><div class="sentence"> Any real discussion of their relation to one another must be preceded by an examination into the nature and character of the Aristotelian writings and the form in which they have come down to us.</div><div class="sentence"> This enquiry is not really separable from an investigation of Theophrastus as well as Aristotle and of the remains of other schools of philosophy as well as of the Peripatetics.</div><div class="sentence"> But, without entering on this wide field, even a superficial consideration of the logical and metaphysical works which pass under the name of Aristotle, whether we suppose them to have come directly from his hand or to be the tradition of his school, is sufficient to show how great was the mental activity which prevailed in the latter half of the fourth century B.C.</div><div class="sentence"> ; what eddies and whirlpools of controversies were surging in the chaos of thought, what transformations of the old philosophies were taking place everywhere, what eclecticisms and syncretisms and realisms and nominalisms were affecting the mind of Hellas.</div><div class="sentence"> The decline of philosophy during this period is no less remarkable than the loss of freedom; and the two are not unconnected with each other.</div><div class="sentence"> But of the multitudinous sea of opinions which were current in the age of Aristotle we have no exact account.</div><div class="sentence"> We know of them from allusions only.</div><div class="sentence"> And we cannot with advantage fill up the void of our knowledge by conjecture: we can only make allowance for our ignorance.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">122</span> <div class="sentence">  There are several passages in the Philebus which are very characteristic of Plato, and which we shall do well to consider not only in their connexion, but apart from their connexion as inspired sayings or oracles which receive their full interpretation only from the history of philosophy in later ages.</div><div class="sentence"> The more serious attacks on traditional beliefs which are often veiled under an unusual simplicity or irony are of this kind.</div><div class="sentence"> Such, for example, is the excessive and more than human awe which Socrates expresses about the names of the gods, which may be not unaptly compared with the importance attached by mankind to theological terms in other ages; for this also may be comprehended under the satire of Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us observe the religious and intellectual enthusiasm which shines forth in the following, 'The power and faculty of loving the truth, and of doing all things for the sake of the truth': or, again, the singular acknowledgment which may be regarded as the anticipation of a new logic, that 'In going to war for mind I must have weapons of a different make from those which I used before, although some of the old ones may do again.'</div><div class="sentence"> Let us pause awhile to reflect on a sentence which is full of meaning to reformers of religion or to the original thinker of all ages: 'Shall we then agree with them of old time, and merely reassert the notions of others without risk to ourselves; or shall we venture also to share in the risk and bear the reproach which will await us': i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> if we assert mind to be the author of nature.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us note the remarkable words, 'That in the divine nature of Zeus there is the soul and mind of a King, because there is in him the power of the cause,' a saying in which theology and philosophy are blended and reconciled; not omitting to observe the deep insight into human nature which is shown by the repetition of the same thought 'All philosophers are agreed that mind is the king of heaven and earth' with the ironical addition, 'in this way truly they magnify themselves.'</div><div class="sentence"> Nor let us pass unheeded the indignation felt by the generous youth at the 'blasphemy' of those who say that Chaos and Chance Medley created the world; or the significance of the words 'those who said of old time that mind rules the universe'; or the pregnant observation that 'we are not always conscious of what we are doing or of what happens to us,' a chance expression to which if philosophers had attended they would have escaped many errors in psychology.</div><div class="sentence"> We may contrast the contempt which is poured upon the verbal difficulty of the one and many, and the seriousness with the unity of opposites is regarded from the higher point of view of abstract ideas: or compare the simple manner in which the question of cause and effect and their mutual dependence is regarded by Plato (to which modern science has returned in Mill and Bacon), and the cumbrous fourfold division of causes in the Physics and Metaphysics of Aristotle, for which it has puzzled the world to find a use in so many centuries.</div><div class="sentence"> When we consider the backwardness of knowledge in the age of Plato, the boldness with which he looks forward into the distance, the many questions of modern philosophy which are anticipated in his writings, may we not truly describe him in his own words as a 'spectator of all time and of all existence'?</div></div>

</div><div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Observe, Protarchus, the nature of the position which you are now going to take from Philebus, and what the other position is which I maintain, and which, if you do not approve of it, is to be controverted by you.</div><div class="sentence"> Shall you and I sum up the two sides?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Philebus was saying that enjoyment and pleasure and delight, and the class of feelings akin to them, are a good to every living being, whereas I contend, that not these, but wisdom and intelligence and memory, and their kindred, right opinion and true reasoning, are better and more desirable than pleasure for all who are able to partake of them, and that to all such who are or ever will be they are the most advantageous of all things.</div><div class="sentence"> Have I not given, Philebus, a fair statement of the two sides of the argument?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span><div class="speaker">PHILEBUS</div><div class="sentence">  Nothing could be fairer, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do you, Protarchus, accept the position which is assigned to you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I cannot do otherwise, since our excellent Philebus has left the field.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Surely the truth about these matters ought, by all means, to be ascertained.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Shall we further agreeâ</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  To what?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That you and I must now try to indicate some state and disposition of the soul, which has the property of making all men happy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, by all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And you say that pleasure, and I say that wisdom, is such a state?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And what if there be a third state, which is better than either?</div><div class="sentence"> Then both of us are vanquishedâare we not?</div><div class="sentence"> But if this life, which really has the power of making men happy, turn out to be more akin to pleasure than to wisdom, the life of pleasure may still have the advantage over the life of wisdom.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Or suppose that the better life is more nearly allied to wisdom, then wisdom conquers, and pleasure is defeated;âdo you agree?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And what do you say, Philebus?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span><div class="speaker">PHILEBUS</div><div class="sentence">  I say, and shall always say, that pleasure is easily the conqueror; but you must decide for yourself, Protarchus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  You, Philebus, have handed over the argument to me, and have no longer a voice in the matter?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span><div class="speaker">PHILEBUS</div><div class="sentence">  True enough.</div><div class="sentence"> Nevertheless I would clear myself and deliver my soul of you; and I call the goddess herself to witness that I now do so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  You may appeal to us; we too will be the witnesses of your words.</div><div class="sentence"> And now, Socrates, whether Philebus is pleased or displeased, we will proceed with the argument.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then let us begin with the goddess herself, of whom Philebus says that she is called Aphrodite, but that her real name is Pleasure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The awe which I always feel, Protarchus, about the names of the gods is more than humanâit exceeds all other fears.</div><div class="sentence"> And now I would not sin against Aphrodite by naming her amiss; let her be called what she pleases.</div><div class="sentence"> But Pleasure I know to be manifold, and with her, as I was just now saying, we must begin, and consider what her nature is.</div><div class="sentence"> She has one name, and therefore you would imagine that she is one; and yet surely she takes the most varied and even unlike forms.</div><div class="sentence"> For do we not say that the intemperate has pleasure, and that the temperate has pleasure in his very temperance,âthat the fool is pleased when he is full of foolish fancies and hopes, and that the wise man has pleasure in his wisdom?</div><div class="sentence"> and how foolish would any one be who affirmed that all these opposite pleasures are severally alike!</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Why, Socrates, they are opposed in so far as they spring from opposite sources, but they are not in themselves opposite.</div><div class="sentence"> For must not pleasure be of all things most absolutely like pleasure,âthat is, like itself?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very likely; but how will this invalidate the argument?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, I shall reply, that dissimilar as they are, you apply to them a new predicate, for you say that all pleasant things are good; now although no one can argue that pleasure is not pleasure, he may argue, as we are doing, that pleasures are oftener bad than good; but you call them all good, and at the same time are compelled, if you are pressed, to acknowledge that they are unlike.</div><div class="sentence"> And so you must tell us what is the identical quality existing alike in good and bad pleasures, which makes you designate all of them as good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean, Socrates?</div><div class="sentence"> Do you think that any one who asserts pleasure to be the good, will tolerate the notion that some pleasures are good and others bad?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet you will acknowledge that they are different from one another, and sometimes opposed?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That is a return to the old position, Protarchus, and so we are to say (are we?)</div><div class="sentence"> that there is no difference in pleasures, but that they are all alike; and the examples which have just been cited do not pierce our dull minds, but we go on arguing all the same, like the weakest and most inexperienced reasoners?</div><div class="sentence"> (Probably corrupt.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, I mean to say, that in self-defence I may, if I like, follow your example, and assert boldly that the two things most unlike are most absolutely alike; and the result will be that you and I will prove ourselves to be very tyros in the art of disputing; and the argument will be blown away and lost.</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose that we put back, and return to the old position; then perhaps we may come to an understanding with one another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Shall I, Protarchus, have my own question asked of me by you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What question?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">040</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Ask me whether wisdom and science and mind, and those other qualities which I, when asked by you at first what is the nature of the good, affirmed to be good, are not in the same case with the pleasures of which you spoke.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The sciences are a numerous class, and will be found to present great differences.</div><div class="sentence"> But even admitting that, like the pleasures, they are opposite as well as different, should I be worthy of the name of dialectician if, in order to avoid this difficulty, I were to say (as you are saying of pleasure) that there is no difference between one science and another;âwould not the argument founder and disappear like an idle tale, although we might ourselves escape drowning by clinging to a fallacy?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">043</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  May none of this befal us, except the deliverance!</div><div class="sentence"> Yet I like the even-handed justice which is applied to both our arguments.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us assume, then, that there are many and diverse pleasures, and many and different sciences.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">044</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And let us have no concealment, Protarchus, of the differences between my good and yours; but let us bring them to the light in the hope that, in the process of testing them, they may show whether pleasure is to be called the good, or wisdom, or some third quality; for surely we are not now simply contending in order that my view or that yours may prevail, but I presume that we ought both of us to be fighting for the truth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly we ought.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">046</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then let us have a more definite understanding and establish the principle on which the argument rests.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">047</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What principle?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">048</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  A principle about which all men are always in a difficulty, and some men sometimes against their will.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">049</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Speak plainer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">050</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The principle which has just turned up, which is a marvel of nature; for that one should be many or many one, are wonderful propositions; and he who affirms either is very open to attack.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Do you mean, when a person says that I, Protarchus, am by nature one and also many, dividing the single 'me' into many 'me's,' and even opposing them as great and small, light and heavy, and in ten thousand other ways?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Those, Protarchus, are the common and acknowledged paradoxes about the one and many, which I may say that everybody has by this time agreed to dismiss as childish and obvious and detrimental to the true course of thought; and no more favour is shown to that other puzzle, in which a person proves the members and parts of anything to be divided, and then confessing that they are all one, says laughingly in disproof of his own words:  Why, here is a miracle, the one is many and infinite, and the many are only one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  But what, Socrates, are those other marvels connected with this subject which, as you imply, have not yet become common and acknowledged?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  When, my boy, the one does not belong to the class of things that are born and perish, as in the instances which we were giving, for in those cases, and when unity is of this concrete nature, there is, as I was saying, a universal consent that no refutation is needed; but when the assertion is made that man is one, or ox is one, or beauty one, or the good one, then the interest which attaches to these and similar unities and the attempt which is made to divide them gives birth to a controversy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of what nature?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In the first place, as to whether these unities have a real existence; and then how each individual unity, being always the same, and incapable either of generation or of destruction, but retaining a permanent individuality, can be conceived either as dispersed and multiplied in the infinity of the world of generation, or as still entire and yet divided from itself, which latter would seem to be the greatest impossibility of all, for how can one and the same thing be at the same time in one and in many things?</div><div class="sentence"> These, Protarchus, are the real difficulties, and this is the one and many to which they relate; they are the source of great perplexity if ill decided, and the right determination of them is very helpful.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Then, Socrates, let us begin by clearing up these questions.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That is what I should wish.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  And I am sure that all my other friends will be glad to hear them discussed; Philebus, fortunately for us, is not disposed to move, and we had better not stir him up with questions.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Good; and where shall we begin this great and multifarious battle, in which such various points are at issue?</div><div class="sentence"> Shall we begin thus?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We say that the one and many become identified by thought, and that now, as in time past, they run about together, in and out of every word which is uttered, and that this union of them will never cease, and is not now beginning, but is, as I believe, an everlasting quality of thought itself, which never grows old.</div><div class="sentence"> Any young man, when he first tastes these subtleties, is delighted, and fancies that he has found a treasure of wisdom; in the first enthusiasm of his joy he leaves no stone, or rather no thought unturned, now rolling up the many into the one, and kneading them together, now unfolding and dividing them; he puzzles himself first and above all, and then he proceeds to puzzle his neighbours, whether they are older or younger, or of his own ageâthat makes no difference; neither father nor mother does he spare; no human being who has ears is safe from him, hardly even his dog, and a barbarian would have no chance of escaping him, if an interpreter could only be found.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Considering, Socrates, how many we are, and that all of us are young men, is there not a danger that we and Philebus may all set upon you, if you abuse us?</div><div class="sentence"> We understand what you mean; but is there no charm by which we may dispel all this confusion, no more excellent way of arriving at the truth?</div><div class="sentence"> If there is, we hope that you will guide us into that way, and we will do our best to follow, for the enquiry in which we are engaged, Socrates, is not unimportant.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The reverse of unimportant, my boys, as Philebus calls you, and there neither is nor ever will be a better than my own favourite way, which has nevertheless already often deserted me and left me helpless in the hour of need.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Tell us what that is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  One which may be easily pointed out, but is by no means easy of application; it is the parent of all the discoveries in the arts.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Tell us what it is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  A gift of heaven, which, as I conceive, the gods tossed among men by the hands of a new Prometheus, and therewith a blaze of light; and the ancients, who were our betters and nearer the gods than we are, handed down the tradition, that whatever things are said to be are composed of one and many, and have the finite and infinite implanted in them:  seeing, then, that such is the order of the world, we too ought in every enquiry to begin by laying down one idea of that which is the subject of enquiry; this unity we shall find in everything.</div><div class="sentence"> Having found it, we may next proceed to look for two, if there be two, or, if not, then for three or some other number, subdividing each of these units, until at last the unity with which we began is seen not only to be one and many and infinite, but also a definite number; the infinite must not be suffered to approach the many until the entire number of the species intermediate between unity and infinity has been discovered,âthen, and not till then, we may rest from division, and without further troubling ourselves about the endless individuals may allow them to drop into infinity.</div><div class="sentence"> This, as I was saying, is the way of considering and learning and teaching one another, which the gods have handed down to us.</div><div class="sentence"> But the wise men of our time are either too quick or too slow in conceiving plurality in unity.</div><div class="sentence"> Having no method, they make their one and many anyhow, and from unity pass at once to infinity; the intermediate steps never occur to them.</div><div class="sentence"> And this, I repeat, is what makes the difference between the mere art of disputation and true dialectic.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I think that I partly understand you Socrates, but I should like to have a clearer notion of what you are saying.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I may illustrate my meaning by the letters of the alphabet, Protarchus, which you were made to learn as a child.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">074</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet not by knowing either that sound is one or that sound is infinite are we perfect in the art of speech, but the knowledge of the number and nature of sounds is what makes a man a grammarian.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">076</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the knowledge which makes a man a musician is of the same kind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">078</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Sound is one in music as well as in grammar?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">079</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And there is a higher note and a lower note, and a note of equal pitch: âmay we affirm so much?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">082</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But you would not be a real musician if this was all that you knew; though if you did not know this you would know almost nothing of music.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">084</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But when you have learned what sounds are high and what low, and the number and nature of the intervals and their limits or proportions, and the systems compounded out of them, which our fathers discovered, and have handed down to us who are their descendants under the name of harmonies; and the affections corresponding to them in the movements of the human body, which when measured by numbers ought, as they say, to be called rhythms and measures; and they tell us that the same principle should be applied to every one and many;âwhen, I say, you have learned all this, then, my dear friend, you are perfect; and you may be said to understand any other subject, when you have a similar grasp of it.</div><div class="sentence"> But the infinity of kinds and the infinity of individuals which there is in each of them, when not classified, creates in every one of us a state of infinite ignorance; and he who never looks for number in anything, will not himself be looked for in the number of famous men.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">085</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I think that what Socrates is now saying is excellent, Philebus.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I will; but you must let me make one little remark first about these matters; I was saying, that he who begins with any individual unity, should proceed from that, not to infinity, but to a definite number, and now I say conversely, that he who has to begin with infinity should not jump to unity, but he should look about for some number representing a certain quantity, and thus out of all end in one.</div><div class="sentence"> And now let us return for an illustration of our principle to the case of letters.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Some god or divine man, who in the Egyptian legend is said to have been Theuth, observing that the human voice was infinite, first distinguished in this infinity a certain number of vowels, and then other letters which had sound, but were not pure vowels (i.e., the semivowels); these too exist in a definite number; and lastly, he distinguished a third class of letters which we now call mutes, without voice and without sound, and divided these, and likewise the two other classes of vowels and semivowels, into the individual sounds, and told the number of them, and gave to each and all of them the name of letters; and observing that none of us could learn any one of them and not learn them all, and in consideration of this common bond which in a manner united them, he assigned to them all a single art, and this he called the art of grammar or letters.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span><div class="speaker">PHILEBUS</div><div class="sentence">  The illustration, Protarchus, has assisted me in understanding the original statement, but I still feel the defect of which I just now complained.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">093</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Are you going to ask, Philebus, what this has to do with the argument?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span><div class="speaker">PHILEBUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, that is a question which Protarchus and I have been long asking.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Assuredly you have already arrived at the answer to the question which, as you say, you have been so long asking?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span><div class="speaker">PHILEBUS</div><div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Did we not begin by enquiring into the comparative eligibility of pleasure and wisdom?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And we maintain that they are each of them one?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the precise question to which the previous discussion desires an answer is, how they are one and also many (i.e., how they have one genus and many species), and are not at once infinite, and what number of species is to be assigned to either of them before they pass into infinity (i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> into the infinite number of individuals).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is a very serious question, Philebus, to which Socrates has ingeniously brought us round, and please to consider which of us shall answer him; there may be something ridiculous in my being unable to answer, and therefore imposing the task upon you, when I have undertaken the whole charge of the argument, but if neither of us were able to answer, the result methinks would be still more ridiculous.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us consider, then, what we are to do: âSocrates, if I understood him rightly, is asking whether there are not kinds of pleasure, and what is the number and nature of them, and the same of wisdom.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">103</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Most true, O son of Callias; and the previous argument showed that if we are not able to tell the kinds of everything that has unity, likeness, sameness, or their opposites, none of us will be of the smallest use in any enquiry.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  That seems to be very near the truth, Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> Happy would the wise man be if he knew all things, and the next best thing for him is that he should know himself.</div><div class="sentence"> Why do I say so at this moment?</div><div class="sentence"> I will tell you.</div><div class="sentence"> You, Socrates, have granted us this opportunity of conversing with you, and are ready to assist us in determining what is the best of human goods.</div><div class="sentence"> For when Philebus said that pleasure and delight and enjoyment and the like were the chief good, you answeredâNo, not those, but another class of goods; and we are constantly reminding ourselves of what you said, and very properly, in order that we may not forget to examine and compare the two.</div><div class="sentence"> And these goods, which in your opinion are to be designated as superior to pleasure, and are the true objects of pursuit, are mind and knowledge and understanding and art, and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> There was a dispute about which were the best, and we playfully threatened that you should not be allowed to go home until the question was settled; and you agreed, and placed yourself at our disposal.</div><div class="sentence"> And now, as children say, what has been fairly given cannot be taken back; cease then to fight against us in this way.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In what way?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span><div class="speaker">PHILEBUS</div><div class="sentence">  Do not perplex us, and keep asking questions of us to which we have not as yet any sufficient answer to give; let us not imagine that a general puzzling of us all is to be the end of our discussion, but if we are unable to answer, do you answer, as you have promised.</div><div class="sentence"> Consider, then, whether you will divide pleasure and knowledge according to their kinds; or you may let the matter drop, if you are able and willing to find some other mode of clearing up our controversy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  If you say that, I have nothing to apprehend, for the words 'if you are willing' dispel all my fear; and, moreover, a god seems to have recalled something to my mind.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">109</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I remember to have heard long ago certain discussions about pleasure and wisdom, whether awake or in a dream I cannot tell; they were to the effect that neither the one nor the other of them was the good, but some third thing, which was different from them, and better than either.</div><div class="sentence"> If this be clearly established, then pleasure will lose the victory, for the good will cease to be identified with her: âAm I not right?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">111</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And there will cease to be any need of distinguishing the kinds of pleasures, as I am inclined to think, but this will appear more clearly as we proceed.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">119</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And no one can deny that all percipient beings desire and hunt after good, and are eager to catch and have the good about them, and care not for the attainment of anything which is not accompanied by good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">120</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is undeniable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">121</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Now let us part off the life of pleasure from the life of wisdom, and pass them in review.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">129</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Would you choose, Protarchus, to live all your life long in the enjoyment of the greatest pleasures?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">137</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if you had neither mind, nor memory, nor knowledge, nor true opinion, you would in the first place be utterly ignorant of whether you were pleased or not, because you would be entirely devoid of intelligence.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">142</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I cannot answer you, Socrates; the argument has taken away from me the power of speech.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">143</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We must keep up our spirits;âlet us now take the life of mind and examine it in turn.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">144</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  And what is this life of mind?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">145</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I want to know whether any one of us would consent to live, having wisdom and mind and knowledge and memory of all things, but having no sense of pleasure or pain, and wholly unaffected by these and the like feelings?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">146</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Neither life, Socrates, appears eligible to me, nor is likely, as I should imagine, to be chosen by any one else.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">147</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What would you say, Protarchus, to both of these in one, or to one that was made out of the union of the two?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">149</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, that is the life which I mean.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">150</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  There can be no difference of opinion; not some but all would surely choose this third rather than either of the other two, and in addition to them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">151</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But do you see the consequence?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">152</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure I do.</div><div class="sentence"> The consequence is, that two out of the three lives which have been proposed are neither sufficient nor eligible for man or for animal.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">153</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then now there can be no doubt that neither of them has the good, for the one which had would certainly have been sufficient and perfect and eligible for every living creature or thing that was able to live such a life; and if any of us had chosen any other, he would have chosen contrary to the nature of the truly eligible, and not of his own free will, but either through ignorance or from some unhappy necessity.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">154</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly that seems to be true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">155</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now have I not sufficiently shown that Philebus' goddess is not to be regarded as identical with the good?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">156</span><div class="speaker">PHILEBUS</div><div class="sentence">  Neither is your 'mind' the good, Socrates, for that will be open to the same objections.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">157</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Perhaps, Philebus, you may be right in saying so of my 'mind'; but of the true, which is also the divine mind, far otherwise.</div><div class="sentence"> However, I will not at present claim the first place for mind as against the mixed life; but we must come to some understanding about the second place.</div><div class="sentence"> For you might affirm pleasure and I mind to be the cause of the mixed life; and in that case although neither of them would be the good, one of them might be imagined to be the cause of the good.</div><div class="sentence"> And I might proceed further to argue in opposition to Philebus, that the element which makes this mixed life eligible and good, is more akin and more similar to mind than to pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> And if this is true, pleasure cannot be truly said to share either in the first or second place, and does not, if I may trust my own mind, attain even to the third.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">158</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Truly, Socrates, pleasure appears to me to have had a fall; in fighting for the palm, she has been smitten by the argument, and is laid low.</div><div class="sentence"> I must say that mind would have fallen too, and may therefore be thought to show discretion in not putting forward a similar claim.</div><div class="sentence"> And if pleasure were deprived not only of the first but of the second place, she would be terribly damaged in the eyes of her admirers, for not even to them would she still appear as fair as before.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">159</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but had we not better leave her now, and not pain her by applying the crucial test, and finally detecting her?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">160</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Nonsense, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">161</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why?</div><div class="sentence"> because I said that we had better not pain pleasure, which is an impossibility?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">162</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, and more than that, because you do not seem to be aware that none of us will let you go home until you have finished the argument.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">163</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Heavens!</div><div class="sentence"> Protarchus, that will be a tedious business, and just at present not at all an easy one.</div><div class="sentence"> For in going to war in the cause of mind, who is aspiring to the second prize, I ought to have weapons of another make from those which I used before; some, however, of the old ones may do again.</div><div class="sentence"> And must I then finish the argument?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">164</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course you must.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">165</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us be very careful in laying the foundation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">166</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">167</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us divide all existing things into two, or rather, if you do not object, into three classes.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">169</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us take some of our newly-found notions.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">170</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Which of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">171</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Were we not saying that God revealed a finite element of existence, and also an infinite?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">172</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">173</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us assume these two principles, and also a third, which is compounded out of them; but I fear that I am ridiculously clumsy at these processes of division and enumeration.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">175</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I say that a fourth class is still wanted.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">177</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Find the cause of the third or compound, and add this as a fourth class to the three others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">178</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  And would you like to have a fifth class or cause of resolution as well as a cause of composition?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">179</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Not, I think, at present; but if I want a fifth at some future time you shall allow me to have it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">180</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">181</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us begin with the first three; and as we find two out of the three greatly divided and dispersed, let us endeavour to reunite them, and see how in each of them there is a one and many.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">182</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  If you would explain to me a little more about them, perhaps I might be able to follow you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">183</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, the two classes are the same which I mentioned before, one the finite, and the other the infinite; I will first show that the infinite is in a certain sense many, and the finite may be hereafter discussed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">184</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">185</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now consider well; for the question to which I invite your attention is difficult and controverted.</div><div class="sentence"> When you speak of hotter and colder, can you conceive any limit in those qualities?</div><div class="sentence"> Does not the more and less, which dwells in their very nature, prevent their having any end?</div><div class="sentence"> for if they had an end, the more and less would themselves have an end.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">186</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">187</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Ever, as we say, into the hotter and the colder there enters a more and a less.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">189</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, says the argument, there is never any end of them, and being endless they must also be infinite.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">190</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates, that is exceedingly true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">191</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, my dear Protarchus, and your answer reminds me that such an expression as 'exceedingly,' which you have just uttered, and also the term 'gently,' have the same significance as more or less; for whenever they occur they do not allow of the existence of quantityâthey are always introducing degrees into actions, instituting a comparison of a more or a less excessive or a more or a less gentle, and at each creation of more or less, quantity disappears.</div><div class="sentence"> For, as I was just now saying, if quantity and measure did not disappear, but were allowed to intrude in the sphere of more and less and the other comparatives, these last would be driven out of their own domain.</div><div class="sentence"> When definite quantity is once admitted, there can be no longer a 'hotter' or a 'colder' (for these are always progressing, and are never in one stay); but definite quantity is at rest, and has ceased to progress.</div><div class="sentence"> Which proves that comparatives, such as the hotter and the colder, are to be ranked in the class of the infinite.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">192</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Your remark certainly has the look of truth, Socrates; but these subjects, as you were saying, are difficult to follow at first.</div><div class="sentence"> I think however, that if I could hear the argument repeated by you once or twice, there would be a substantial agreement between us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">193</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, and I will try to meet your wish; but, as I would rather not waste time in the enumeration of endless particulars, let me know whether I may not assume as a note of the infiniteâ</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">194</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">195</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I want to know whether such things as appear to us to admit of more or less, or are denoted by the words 'exceedingly,' 'gently,' 'extremely,' and the like, may not be referred to the class of the infinite, which is their unity, for, as was asserted in the previous argument, all things that were divided and dispersed should be brought together, and have the mark or seal of some one nature, if possible, set upon themâdo you remember?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">196</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">197</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And all things which do not admit of more or less, but admit their opposites, that is to say, first of all, equality, and the equal, or again, the double, or any other ratio of number and measureâall these may, I think, be rightly reckoned by us in the class of the limited or finite; what do you say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">198</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Excellent, Socrates.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">200</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  You, I think, will have to tell me that.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">203</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I am thinking, Protarchus, and I believe that some God has befriended us.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">212</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is the other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">213</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The class of the finite which we ought to have brought together as we did the infinite; but, perhaps, it will come to the same thing if we do so now;âwhen the two are combined, a third will appear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">214</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean by the class of the finite?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">215</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The class of the equal and the double, and any class which puts an end to difference and opposition, and by introducing number creates harmony and proportion among the different elements.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">249</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the creator or cause of them has been satisfactorily proven to be distinct from them,âand may therefore be called a fourth principle?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">250</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  So let us call it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">251</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Quite right; but now, having distinguished the four, I think that we had better refresh our memories by recapitulating each of them in order.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">252</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">253</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then the first I will call the infinite or unlimited, and the second the finite or limited; then follows the third, an essence compound and generated; and I do not think that I shall be far wrong in speaking of the cause of mixture and generation as the fourth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">254</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">255</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now what is the next question, and how came we hither?</div><div class="sentence"> Were we not enquiring whether the second place belonged to pleasure or wisdom?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">256</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  We were.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">257</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now, having determined these points, shall we not be better able to decide about the first and second place, which was the original subject of dispute?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">258</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I dare say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">259</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We said, if you remember, that the mixed life of pleasure and wisdom was the conquerorâdid we not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">260</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">261</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And we see what is the place and nature of this life and to what class it is to be assigned?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">262</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Beyond a doubt.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">263</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  This is evidently comprehended in the third or mixed class; which is not composed of any two particular ingredients, but of all the elements of infinity, bound down by the finite, and may therefore be truly said to comprehend the conqueror life.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">264</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">265</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And what shall we say, Philebus, of your life which is all sweetness; and in which of the aforesaid classes is that to be placed?</div><div class="sentence"> Perhaps you will allow me to ask you a question before you answer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">266</span><div class="speaker">PHILEBUS</div><div class="sentence">  Let me hear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">267</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Have pleasure and pain a limit, or do they belong to the class which admits of more and less?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">268</span><div class="speaker">PHILEBUS</div><div class="sentence">  They belong to the class which admits of more, Socrates; for pleasure would not be perfectly good if she were not infinite in quantity and degree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">269</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Nor would pain, Philebus, be perfectly evil.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore the infinite cannot be that element which imparts to pleasure some degree of good.</div><div class="sentence"> But nowâadmitting, if you like, that pleasure is of the nature of the infiniteâin which of the aforesaid classes, O Protarchus and Philebus, can we without irreverence place wisdom and knowledge and mind?</div><div class="sentence"> And let us be careful, for I think that the danger will be very serious if we err on this point.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">270</span><div class="speaker">PHILEBUS</div><div class="sentence">  You magnify, Socrates, the importance of your favourite god.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">271</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And you, my friend, are also magnifying your favourite goddess; but still I must beg you to answer the question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">272</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Socrates is quite right, Philebus, and we must submit to him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">273</span><div class="speaker">PHILEBUS</div><div class="sentence">  And did not you, Protarchus, propose to answer in my place?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">274</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly I did; but I am now in a great strait, and I must entreat you, Socrates, to be our spokesman, and then we shall not say anything wrong or disrespectful of your favourite.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">275</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I must obey you, Protarchus; nor is the task which you impose a difficult one; but did I really, as Philebus implies, disconcert you with my playful solemnity, when I asked the question to what class mind and knowledge belong?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">276</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  You did, indeed, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">277</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yet the answer is easy, since all philosophers assert with one voice that mind is the king of heaven and earthâin reality they are magnifying themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> And perhaps they are right.</div><div class="sentence"> But still I should like to consider the class of mind, if you do not object, a little more fully.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">278</span><div class="speaker">PHILEBUS</div><div class="sentence">  Take your own course, Socrates, and never mind length; we shall not tire of you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">279</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good; let us begin then, Protarchus, by asking a question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">280</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What question?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">281</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Whether all this which they call the universe is left to the guidance of unreason and chance medley, or, on the contrary, as our fathers have declared, ordered and governed by a marvellous intelligence and wisdom.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">282</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Wide asunder are the two assertions, illustrious Socrates, for that which you were just now saying to me appears to be blasphemy; but the other assertion, that mind orders all things, is worthy of the aspect of the world, and of the sun, and of the moon, and of the stars and of the whole circle of the heavens; and never will I say or think otherwise.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">283</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Shall we then agree with them of old time in maintaining this doctrine,ânot merely reasserting the notions of others, without risk to ourselves,âbut shall we share in the danger, and take our part of the reproach which will await us, when an ingenious individual declares that all is disorder?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">284</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  That would certainly be my wish.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">285</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then now please to consider the next stage of the argument.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">286</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Let me hear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">287</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We see that the elements which enter into the nature of the bodies of all animals, fire, water, air, and, as the storm-tossed sailor cries, 'land' (i.e., earth), reappear in the constitution of the world.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">288</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  The proverb may be applied to us; for truly the storm gathers over us, and we are at our wit's end.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">289</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There is something to be remarked about each of these elements.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">290</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">291</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Only a small fraction of any one of them exists in us, and that of a mean sort, and not in any way pure, or having any power worthy of its nature.</div><div class="sentence"> One instance will prove this of all of them; there is fire within us, and in the universe.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">292</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">293</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is not our fire small and weak and mean?</div><div class="sentence"> But the fire in the universe is wonderful in quantity and beauty, and in every power that fire has.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">294</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">295</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is the fire in the universe nourished and generated and ruled by the fire in us, or is the fire in you and me, and in other animals, dependent on the universal fire?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">296</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is a question which does not deserve an answer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">297</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Right; and you would say the same, if I am not mistaken, of the earth which is in animals and the earth which is in the universe, and you would give a similar reply about all the other elements?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">298</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Why, how could any man who gave any other be deemed in his senses?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">299</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I do not think that he couldâbut now go on to the next step.</div><div class="sentence"> When we saw those elements of which we have been speaking gathered up in one, did we not call them a body?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">300</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  We did.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">301</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the same may be said of the cosmos, which for the same reason may be considered to be a body, because made up of the same elements.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">302</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">303</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But is our body nourished wholly by this body, or is this body nourished by our body, thence deriving and having the qualities of which we were just now speaking?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">304</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  That again, Socrates, is a question which does not deserve to be asked.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">305</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, tell me, is this question worth asking?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">306</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What question?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">307</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  May our body be said to have a soul?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">308</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">309</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And whence comes that soul, my dear Protarchus, unless the body of the universe, which contains elements like those in our bodies but in every way fairer, had also a soul?</div><div class="sentence"> Can there be another source?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">310</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly, Socrates, that is the only source.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">311</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, yes, Protarchus; for surely we cannot imagine that of the four classes, the finite, the infinite, the composition of the two, and the cause, the fourth, which enters into all things, giving to our bodies souls, and the art of self-management, and of healing disease, and operating in other ways to heal and organize, having too all the attributes of wisdom;âwe cannot, I say, imagine that whereas the self-same elements exist, both in the entire heaven and in great provinces of the heaven, only fairer and purer, this last should not also in that higher sphere have designed the noblest and fairest things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">312</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Such a supposition is quite unreasonable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">313</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then if this be denied, should we not be wise in adopting the other view and maintaining that there is in the universe a mighty infinite and an adequate limit, of which we have often spoken, as well as a presiding cause of no mean power, which orders and arranges years and seasons and months, and may be justly called wisdom and mind?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">314</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most justly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">315</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And wisdom and mind cannot exist without soul?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">316</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">317</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And in the divine nature of Zeus would you not say that there is the soul and mind of a king, because there is in him the power of the cause?</div><div class="sentence"> And other gods have other attributes, by which they are pleased to be called.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">318</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">319</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do not then suppose that these words are rashly spoken by us, O Protarchus, for they are in harmony with the testimony of those who said of old time that mind rules the universe.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">320</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">321</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And they furnish an answer to my enquiry; for they imply that mind is the parent of that class of the four which we called the cause of all; and I think that you now have my answer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">322</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I have indeed, and yet I did not observe that you had answered.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">323</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  A jest is sometimes refreshing, Protarchus, when it interrupts earnest.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">324</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">325</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I think, friend, that we have now pretty clearly set forth the class to which mind belongs and what is the power of mind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">326</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">327</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the class to which pleasure belongs has also been long ago discovered?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">328</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">329</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And let us remember, too, of both of them, (1) that mind was akin to the cause and of this family; and (2) that pleasure is infinite and belongs to the class which neither has, nor ever will have in itself, a beginning, middle, or end of its own.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">330</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I shall be sure to remember.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">331</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We must next examine what is their place and under what conditions they are generated.</div><div class="sentence"> And we will begin with pleasure, since her class was first examined; and yet pleasure cannot be rightly tested apart from pain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">332</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  If this is the road, let us take it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">333</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I wonder whether you would agree with me about the origin of pleasure and pain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">334</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">335</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I mean to say that their natural seat is in the mixed class.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">336</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  And would you tell me again, sweet Socrates, which of the aforesaid classes is the mixed one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">337</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I will, my fine fellow, to the best of my ability.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">338</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">339</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us then understand the mixed class to be that which we placed third in the list of four.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">340</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  That which followed the infinite and the finite; and in which you ranked health, and, if I am not mistaken, harmony.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">341</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Capital; and now will you please to give me your best attention?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">342</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Proceed; I am attending.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">343</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I say that when the harmony in animals is dissolved, there is also a dissolution of nature and a generation of pain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">344</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is very probable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">345</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the restoration of harmony and return to nature is the source of pleasure, if I may be allowed to speak in the fewest and shortest words about matters of the greatest moment.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">346</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I believe that you are right, Socrates; but will you try to be a little plainer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">347</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do not obvious and every-day phenomena furnish the simplest illustration?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">348</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What phenomena do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">349</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Hunger, for example, is a dissolution and a pain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">350</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">351</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Whereas eating is a replenishment and a pleasure?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">352</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">353</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Thirst again is a destruction and a pain, but the effect of moisture replenishing the dry place is a pleasure:  once more, the unnatural separation and dissolution caused by heat is painful, and the natural restoration and refrigeration is pleasant.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">354</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">355</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the unnatural freezing of the moisture in an animal is pain, and the natural process of resolution and return of the elements to their original state is pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> And would not the general proposition seem to you to hold, that the destroying of the natural union of the finite and infinite, which, as I was observing before, make up the class of living beings, is pain, and that the process of return of all things to their own nature is pleasure?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">356</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Granted; what you say has a general truth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">357</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Here then is one kind of pleasures and pains originating severally in the two processes which we have described?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">358</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">359</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us next assume that in the soul herself there is an antecedent hope of pleasure which is sweet and refreshing, and an expectation of pain, fearful and anxious.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">360</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; this is another class of pleasures and pains, which is of the soul only, apart from the body, and is produced by expectation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">361</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Right; for in the analysis of these, pure, as I suppose them to be, the pleasures being unalloyed with pain and the pains with pleasure, methinks that we shall see clearly whether the whole class of pleasure is to be desired, or whether this quality of entire desirableness is not rather to be attributed to another of the classes which have been mentioned; and whether pleasure and pain, like heat and cold, and other things of the same kind, are not sometimes to be desired and sometimes not to be desired, as being not in themselves good, but only sometimes and in some instances admitting of the nature of good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">362</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  You say most truly that this is the track which the investigation should pursue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">363</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, assuming that pain ensues on the dissolution, and pleasure on the restoration of the harmony, let us now ask what will be the condition of animated beings who are neither in process of restoration nor of dissolution.</div><div class="sentence"> And mind what you say:  I ask whether any animal who is in that condition can possibly have any feeling of pleasure or pain, great or small?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">364</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">365</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then here we have a third state, over and above that of pleasure and of pain?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">366</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">367</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do not forget that there is such a state; it will make a great difference in our judgment of pleasure, whether we remember this or not.</div><div class="sentence"> And I should like to say a few words about it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">368</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What have you to say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">369</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, you know that if a man chooses the life of wisdom, there is no reason why he should not live in this neutral state.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">370</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  You mean that he may live neither rejoicing nor sorrowing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">371</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; and if I remember rightly, when the lives were compared, no degree of pleasure, whether great or small, was thought to be necessary to him who chose the life of thought and wisdom.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">372</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, certainly, we said so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">373</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then he will live without pleasure; and who knows whether this may not be the most divine of all lives?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">374</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  If so, the gods, at any rate, cannot be supposed to have either joy or sorrow.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">375</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly notâthere would be a great impropriety in the assumption of either alternative.</div><div class="sentence"> But whether the gods are or are not indifferent to pleasure is a point which may be considered hereafter if in any way relevant to the argument, and whatever is the conclusion we will place it to the account of mind in her contest for the second place, should she have to resign the first.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">376</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Just so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">377</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The other class of pleasures, which as we were saying is purely mental, is entirely derived from memory.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">378</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">379</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I must first of all analyze memory, or rather perception which is prior to memory, if the subject of our discussion is ever to be properly cleared up.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">380</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How will you proceed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">381</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us imagine affections of the body which are extinguished before they reach the soul, and leave her unaffected; and again, other affections which vibrate through both soul and body, and impart a shock to both and to each of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">382</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Granted.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">383</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the soul may be truly said to be oblivious of the first but not of the second?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">384</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">385</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  When I say oblivious, do not suppose that I mean forgetfulness in a literal sense; for forgetfulness is the exit of memory, which in this case has not yet entered; and to speak of the loss of that which is not yet in existence, and never has been, is a contradiction; do you see?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">386</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">387</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then just be so good as to change the terms.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">388</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How shall I change them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">389</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Instead of the oblivion of the soul, when you are describing the state in which she is unaffected by the shocks of the body, say unconsciousness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">390</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I see.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">391</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the union or communion of soul and body in one feeling and motion would be properly called consciousness?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">392</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">393</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then now we know the meaning of the word?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">394</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">395</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And memory may, I think, be rightly described as the preservation of consciousness?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">396</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">397</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But do we not distinguish memory from recollection?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">398</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I think so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">399</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do we not mean by recollection the power which the soul has of recovering, when by herself, some feeling which she experienced when in company with the body?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">400</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">401</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And when she recovers of herself the lost recollection of some consciousness or knowledge, the recovery is termed recollection and reminiscence?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">402</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">403</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There is a reason why I say all this.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">404</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">405</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I want to attain the plainest possible notion of pleasure and desire, as they exist in the mind only, apart from the body; and the previous analysis helps to show the nature of both.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">406</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Then now, Socrates, let us proceed to the next point.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">407</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There are certainly many things to be considered in discussing the generation and whole complexion of pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> At the outset we must determine the nature and seat of desire.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">408</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Ay; let us enquire into that, for we shall lose nothing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">409</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Nay, Protarchus, we shall surely lose the puzzle if we find the answer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">410</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  A fair retort; but let us proceed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">411</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Did we not place hunger, thirst, and the like, in the class of desires?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">412</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">413</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet they are very different; what common nature have we in view when we call them by a single name?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">414</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  By heavens, Socrates, that is a question which is not easily answered; but it must be answered.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">415</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then let us go back to our examples.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">416</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Where shall we begin?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">417</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do we mean anything when we say 'a man thirsts'?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">418</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">419</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We mean to say that he 'is empty'?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">420</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">421</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is not thirst desire?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">422</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, of drink.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">423</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Would you say of drink, or of replenishment with drink?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">424</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should say, of replenishment with drink.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">425</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then he who is empty desires, as would appear, the opposite of what he experiences; for he is empty and desires to be full?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">426</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">427</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But how can a man who is empty for the first time, attain either by perception or memory to any apprehension of replenishment, of which he has no present or past experience?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">428</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">429</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet he who desires, surely desires something?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">430</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">431</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He does not desire that which he experiences, for he experiences thirst, and thirst is emptiness; but he desires replenishment?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">432</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">433</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then there must be something in the thirsty man which in some way apprehends replenishment?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">434</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  There must.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">435</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And that cannot be the body, for the body is supposed to be emptied?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">436</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">437</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The only remaining alternative is that the soul apprehends the replenishment by the help of memory; as is obvious, for what other way can there be?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">438</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I cannot imagine any other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">439</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But do you see the consequence?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">440</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">441</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That there is no such thing as desire of the body.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">442</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Why so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">443</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, because the argument shows that the endeavour of every animal is to the reverse of his bodily state.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">444</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">445</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the impulse which leads him to the opposite of what he is experiencing proves that he has a memory of the opposite state.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">446</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">447</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the argument, having proved that memory attracts us towards the objects of desire, proves also that the impulses and the desires and the moving principle in every living being have their origin in the soul.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">448</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">449</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The argument will not allow that our body either hungers or thirsts or has any similar experience.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">450</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">451</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let me make a further observation; the argument appears to me to imply that there is a kind of life which consists in these affections.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">452</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of what affections, and of what kind of life, are you speaking?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">453</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I am speaking of being emptied and replenished, and of all that relates to the preservation and destruction of living beings, as well as of the pain which is felt in one of these states and of the pleasure which succeeds to it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">454</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">455</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And what would you say of the intermediate state?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">456</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean by 'intermediate'?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">457</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I mean when a person is in actual suffering and yet remembers past pleasures which, if they would only return, would relieve him; but as yet he has them not.</div><div class="sentence"> May we not say of him, that he is in an intermediate state?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">458</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">459</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Would you say that he was wholly pained or wholly pleased?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">460</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Nay, I should say that he has two pains; in his body there is the actual experience of pain, and in his soul longing and expectation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">461</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean, Protarchus, by the two pains?</div><div class="sentence"> May not a man who is empty have at one time a sure hope of being filled, and at other times be quite in despair?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">462</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">463</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And has he not the pleasure of memory when he is hoping to be filled, and yet in that he is empty is he not at the same time in pain?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">464</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">465</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then man and the other animals have at the same time both pleasure and pain?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">466</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">467</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But when a man is empty and has no hope of being filled, there will be the double experience of pain.</div><div class="sentence"> You observed this and inferred that the double experience was the single case possible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">468</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">469</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Shall the enquiry into these states of feeling be made the occasion of raising a question?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">470</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What question?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">471</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Whether we ought to say that the pleasures and pains of which we are speaking are true or false?</div><div class="sentence"> or some true and some false?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">472</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  But how, Socrates, can there be false pleasures and pains?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">473</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And how, Protarchus, can there be true and false fears, or true and false expectations, or true and false opinions?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">474</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I grant that opinions may be true or false, but not pleasures.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">475</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div><div class="sentence"> I am afraid that we are raising a very serious enquiry.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">476</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  There I agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">477</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet, my boy, for you are one of Philebus' boys, the point to be considered, is, whether the enquiry is relevant to the argument.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">478</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Surely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">479</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  No tedious and irrelevant discussion can be allowed; what is said should be pertinent.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">480</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">481</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I am always wondering at the question which has now been raised.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">482</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">483</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do you deny that some pleasures are false, and others true?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">484</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure I do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">485</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Would you say that no one ever seemed to rejoice and yet did not rejoice, or seemed to feel pain and yet did not feel pain, sleeping or waking, mad or lunatic?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">486</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  So we have always held, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">487</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But were you right?</div><div class="sentence"> Shall we enquire into the truth of your opinion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">488</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I think that we should.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">489</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us then put into more precise terms the question which has arisen about pleasure and opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> Is there such a thing as opinion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">490</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">491</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And such a thing as pleasure?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">492</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">493</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And an opinion must be of something?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">494</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">495</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And a man must be pleased by something?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">496</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite correct.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">497</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And whether the opinion be right or wrong, makes no difference; it will still be an opinion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">498</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">499</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And he who is pleased, whether he is rightly pleased or not, will always have a real feeling of pleasure?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">500</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; that is also quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">501</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, how can opinion be both true and false, and pleasure true only, although pleasure and opinion are both equally real?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">502</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; that is the question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">503</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You mean that opinion admits of truth and falsehood, and hence becomes not merely opinion, but opinion of a certain quality; and this is what you think should be examined?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">504</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">505</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And further, even if we admit the existence of qualities in other objects, may not pleasure and pain be simple and devoid of quality?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">506</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">507</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But there is no difficulty in seeing that pleasure and pain as well as opinion have qualities, for they are great or small, and have various degrees of intensity; as was indeed said long ago by us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">508</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">509</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if badness attaches to any of them, Protarchus, then we should speak of a bad opinion or of a bad pleasure?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">510</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">511</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if rightness attaches to any of them, should we not speak of a right opinion or right pleasure; and in like manner of the reverse of rightness?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">512</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">513</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if the thing opined be erroneous, might we not say that the opinion, being erroneous, is not right or rightly opined?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">514</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">515</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if we see a pleasure or pain which errs in respect of its object, shall we call that right or good, or by any honourable name?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">516</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Not if the pleasure is mistaken; how could we?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">517</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And surely pleasure often appears to accompany an opinion which is not true, but false?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">518</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly it does; and in that case, Socrates, as we were saying, the opinion is false, but no one could call the actual pleasure false.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">519</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How eagerly, Protarchus, do you rush to the defence of pleasure!</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">520</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Nay, Socrates, I only repeat what I hear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">521</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is there no difference, my friend, between that pleasure which is associated with right opinion and knowledge, and that which is often found in all of us associated with falsehood and ignorance?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">522</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  There must be a very great difference, between them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">523</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, now let us proceed to contemplate this difference.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">524</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Lead, and I will follow.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">525</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, my view isâ</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">526</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">527</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We agreeâdo we not?âthat there is such a thing as false, and also such a thing as true opinion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">528</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">529</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And pleasure and pain, as I was just now saying, are often consequent upon theseâupon true and false opinion, I mean.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">530</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">531</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do not opinion and the endeavour to form an opinion always spring from memory and perception?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">532</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">533</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Might we imagine the process to be something of this nature?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">534</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of what nature?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">535</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  An object may be often seen at a distance not very clearly, and the seer may want to determine what it is which he sees.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">536</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very likely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">537</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Soon he begins to interrogate himself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">538</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  In what manner?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">539</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He asks himselfâ'What is that which appears to be standing by the rock under the tree?'</div><div class="sentence"> This is the question which he may be supposed to put to himself when he sees such an appearance.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">540</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">541</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  To which he may guess the right answer, saying as if in a whisper to himselfâ'It is a man.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">542</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">543</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Or again, he may be misled, and then he will sayâ'No, it is a figure made by the shepherds.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">544</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">545</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if he has a companion, he repeats his thought to him in articulate sounds, and what was before an opinion, has now become a proposition.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">546</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">547</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if he be walking alone when these thoughts occur to him, he may not unfrequently keep them in his mind for a considerable time.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">548</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">549</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, now, I wonder whether you would agree in my explanation of this phenomenon.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">550</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is your explanation?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">551</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I think that the soul at such times is like a book.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">552</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">553</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Memory and perception meet, and they and their attendant feelings seem to almost to write down words in the soul, and when the inscribing feeling writes truly, then true opinion and true propositions which are the expressions of opinion come into our soulsâbut when the scribe within us writes falsely, the result is false.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">554</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I quite assent and agree to your statement.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">555</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I must bespeak your favour also for another artist, who is busy at the same time in the chambers of the soul.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">556</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Who is he?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">557</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The painter, who, after the scribe has done his work, draws images in the soul of the things which he has described.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">558</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  But when and how does he do this?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">559</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  When a man, besides receiving from sight or some other sense certain opinions or statements, sees in his mind the images of the subjects of them;âis not this a very common mental phenomenon?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">560</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">561</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the images answering to true opinions and words are true, and to false opinions and words false; are they not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">562</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  They are.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">563</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  If we are right so far, there arises a further question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">564</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">565</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Whether we experience the feeling of which I am speaking only in relation to the present and the past, or in relation to the future also?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">566</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should say in relation to all times alike.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">567</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Have not purely mental pleasures and pains been described already as in some cases anticipations of the bodily ones; from which we may infer that anticipatory pleasures and pains have to do with the future?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">568</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">569</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do all those writings and paintings which, as we were saying a little while ago, are produced in us, relate to the past and present only, and not to the future?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">570</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  To the future, very much.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">571</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  When you say, 'Very much,' you mean to imply that all these representations are hopes about the future, and that mankind are filled with hopes in every stage of existence?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">572</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">573</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Answer me another question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">574</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What question?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">575</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  A just and pious and good man is the friend of the gods; is he not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">576</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly he is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">577</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the unjust and utterly bad man is the reverse?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">578</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">579</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And all men, as we were saying just now, are always filled with hopes?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">580</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">581</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And these hopes, as they are termed, are propositions which exist in the minds of each of us?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">582</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">583</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the fancies of hope are also pictured in us; a man may often have a vision of a heap of gold, and pleasures ensuing, and in the picture there may be a likeness of himself mightily rejoicing over his good fortune.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">584</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">585</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And may we not say that the good, being friends of the gods, have generally true pictures presented to them, and the bad false pictures?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">586</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">587</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The bad, too, have pleasures painted in their fancy as well as the good; but I presume that they are false pleasures.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">588</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  They are.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">589</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The bad then commonly delight in false pleasures, and the good in true pleasures?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">590</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Doubtless.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">591</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then upon this view there are false pleasures in the souls of men which are a ludicrous imitation of the true, and there are pains of a similar character?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">592</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  There are.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">593</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And did we not allow that a man who had an opinion at all had a real opinion, but often about things which had no existence either in the past, present, or future?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">594</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">595</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And this was the source of false opinion and opining; am I not right?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">596</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">597</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And must we not attribute to pleasure and pain a similar real but illusory character?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">598</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">599</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I mean to say that a man must be admitted to have real pleasure who is pleased with anything or anyhow; and he may be pleased about things which neither have nor have ever had any real existence, and, more often than not, are never likely to exist.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">600</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates, that again is undeniable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">601</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And may not the same be said about fear and anger and the like; are they not often false?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">602</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">603</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And can opinions be good or bad except in as far as they are true or false?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">604</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  In no other way.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">605</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Nor can pleasures be conceived to be bad except in so far as they are false.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">606</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Nay, Socrates, that is the very opposite of truth; for no one would call pleasures and pains bad because they are false, but by reason of some other great corruption to which they are liable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">607</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, of pleasures which are corrupt and caused by corruption we will hereafter speak, if we care to continue the enquiry; for the present I would rather show by another argument that there are many false pleasures existing or coming into existence in us, because this may assist our final decision.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">608</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true; that is to say, if there are such pleasures.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">609</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I think that there are, Protarchus; but this is an opinion which should be well assured, and not rest upon a mere assertion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">610</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">611</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then now, like wrestlers, let us approach and grasp this new argument.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">612</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Proceed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">613</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We were maintaining a little while since, that when desires, as they are termed, exist in us, then the body has separate feelings apart from the soulâdo you remember?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">614</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I remember that you said so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">615</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the soul was supposed to desire the opposite of the bodily state, while the body was the source of any pleasure or pain which was experienced.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">616</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">617</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then now you may infer what happens in such cases.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">618</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What am I to infer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">619</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That in such cases pleasures and pains come simultaneously; and there is a juxtaposition of the opposite sensations which correspond to them, as has been already shown.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">620</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">621</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And there is another point to which we have agreed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">622</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">623</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That pleasure and pain both admit of more and less, and that they are of the class of infinites.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">624</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly, we said so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">625</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But how can we rightly judge of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">626</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How can we?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">627</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Is it our intention to judge of their comparative importance and intensity, measuring pleasure against pain, and pain against pain, and pleasure against pleasure?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">628</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, such is our intention, and we shall judge of them accordingly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">629</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, take the case of sight.</div><div class="sentence"> Does not the nearness or distance of magnitudes obscure their true proportions, and make us opine falsely; and do we not find the same illusion happening in the case of pleasures and pains?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">630</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates, and in a degree far greater.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">631</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then what we are now saying is the opposite of what we were saying before.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">632</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What was that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">633</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then the opinions were true and false, and infected the pleasures and pains with their own falsity.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">634</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">635</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But now it is the pleasures which are said to be true and false because they are seen at various distances, and subjected to comparison; the pleasures appear to be greater and more vehement when placed side by side with the pains, and the pains when placed side by side with the pleasures.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">636</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly, and for the reason which you mention.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">637</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And suppose you part off from pleasures and pains the element which makes them appear to be greater or less than they really are:  you will acknowledge that this element is illusory, and you will never say that the corresponding excess or defect of pleasure or pain is real or true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">638</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">639</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Next let us see whether in another direction we may not find pleasures and pains existing and appearing in living beings, which are still more false than these.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">640</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What are they, and how shall we find them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">641</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  If I am not mistaken, I have often repeated that pains and aches and suffering and uneasiness of all sorts arise out of a corruption of nature caused by concretions, and dissolutions, and repletions, and evacuations, and also by growth and decay?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">642</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, that has been often said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">643</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And we have also agreed that the restoration of the natural state is pleasure?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">644</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">645</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But now let us suppose an interval of time at which the body experiences none of these changes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">646</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  When can that be, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">647</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Your question, Protarchus, does not help the argument.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">648</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Why not, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">649</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Because it does not prevent me from repeating mine.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">650</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  And what was that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">651</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, Protarchus, admitting that there is no such interval, I may ask what would be the necessary consequence if there were?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">652</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  You mean, what would happen if the body were not changed either for good or bad?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">653</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">654</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Why then, Socrates, I should suppose that there would be neither pleasure nor pain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">655</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good; but still, if I am not mistaken, you do assert that we must always be experiencing one of them; that is what the wise tell us; for, say they, all things are ever flowing up and down.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">656</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, and their words are of no mean authority.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">657</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Of course, for they are no mean authorities themselves; and I should like to avoid the brunt of their argument.</div><div class="sentence"> Shall I tell you how I mean to escape from them?</div><div class="sentence"> And you shall be the partner of my flight.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">658</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">659</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  To them we will say:  'Good; but are we, or living things in general, always conscious of what happens to usâfor example, of our growth, or the like?</div><div class="sentence"> Are we not, on the contrary, almost wholly unconscious of this and similar phenomena?'</div><div class="sentence"> You must answer for them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">660</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  The latter alternative is the true one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">661</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then we were not right in saying, just now, that motions going up and down cause pleasures and pains?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">662</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">663</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  A better and more unexceptionable way of speaking will beâ</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">664</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">665</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  If we say that the great changes produce pleasures and pains, but that the moderate and lesser ones do neither.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">666</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  That, Socrates, is the more correct mode of speaking.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">667</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if this be true, the life to which I was just now referring again appears.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">668</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What life?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">669</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The life which we affirmed to be devoid either of pain or of joy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">670</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">671</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We may assume then that there are three lives, one pleasant, one painful, and the third which is neither; what say you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">672</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should say as you do that there are three of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">673</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if so, the negation of pain will not be the same with pleasure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">674</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">675</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then when you hear a person saying, that always to live without pain is the pleasantest of all things, what would you understand him to mean by that statement?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">676</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I think that by pleasure he must mean the negative of pain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">677</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us take any three things; or suppose that we embellish a little and call the first gold, the second silver, and there shall be a third which is neither.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">678</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">679</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Now, can that which is neither be either gold or silver?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">680</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">681</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  No more can that neutral or middle life be rightly or reasonably spoken or thought of as pleasant or painful.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">682</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">683</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet, my friend, there are, as we know, persons who say and think so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">684</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">685</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do they think that they have pleasure when they are free from pain?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">686</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  They say so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">687</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And they must think or they would not say that they have pleasure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">688</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">689</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet if pleasure and the negation of pain are of distinct natures, they are wrong.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">690</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  But they are undoubtedly of distinct natures.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">691</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then shall we take the view that they are three, as we were just now saying, or that they are two onlyâthe one being a state of pain, which is an evil, and the other a cessation of pain, which is of itself a good, and is called pleasant?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">692</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  But why, Socrates, do we ask the question at all?</div><div class="sentence"> I do not see the reason.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">693</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You, Protarchus, have clearly never heard of certain enemies of our friend Philebus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">694</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  And who may they be?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">695</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certain persons who are reputed to be masters in natural philosophy, who deny the very existence of pleasure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">696</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Indeed!</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">697</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  They say that what the school of Philebus calls pleasures are all of them only avoidances of pain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">698</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  And would you, Socrates, have us agree with them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">699</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, no, I would rather use them as a sort of diviners, who divine the truth, not by rules of art, but by an instinctive repugnance and extreme detestation which a noble nature has of the power of pleasure, in which they think that there is nothing sound, and her seductive influence is declared by them to be witchcraft, and not pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> This is the use which you may make of them.</div><div class="sentence"> And when you have considered the various grounds of their dislike, you shall hear from me what I deem to be true pleasures.</div><div class="sentence"> Having thus examined the nature of pleasure from both points of view, we will bring her up for judgment.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">700</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Well said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">701</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then let us enter into an alliance with these philosophers and follow in the track of their dislike.</div><div class="sentence"> I imagine that they would say something of this sort; they would begin at the beginning, and ask whether, if we wanted to know the nature of any quality, such as hardness, we should be more likely to discover it by looking at the hardest things, rather than at the least hard?</div><div class="sentence"> You, Protarchus, shall answer these severe gentlemen as you answer me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">702</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  By all means, and I reply to them, that you should look at the greatest instances.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">703</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then if we want to see the true nature of pleasures as a class, we should not look at the most diluted pleasures, but at the most extreme and most vehement?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">704</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  In that every one will agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">705</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the obvious instances of the greatest pleasures, as we have often said, are the pleasures of the body?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">706</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">707</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And are they felt by us to be or become greater, when we are sick or when we are in health?</div><div class="sentence"> And here we must be careful in our answer, or we shall come to grief.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">708</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How will that be?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">709</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, because we might be tempted to answer, 'When we are in health.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">710</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, that is the natural answer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">711</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but are not those pleasures the greatest of which mankind have the greatest desires?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">712</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">713</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do not people who are in a fever, or any similar illness, feel cold or thirst or other bodily affections more intensely?</div><div class="sentence"> Am I not right in saying that they have a deeper want and greater pleasure in the satisfaction of their want?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">714</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is obvious as soon as it is said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">715</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, shall we not be right in saying, that if a person would wish to see the greatest pleasures he ought to go and look, not at health, but at disease?</div><div class="sentence"> And here you must distinguish: âdo not imagine that I mean to ask whether those who are very ill have more pleasures than those who are well, but understand that I am speaking of the magnitude of pleasure; I want to know where pleasures are found to be most intense.</div><div class="sentence"> For, as I say, we have to discover what is pleasure, and what they mean by pleasure who deny her very existence.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">716</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I think I follow you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">717</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You will soon have a better opportunity of showing whether you do or not, Protarchus.</div><div class="sentence"> Answer now, and tell me whether you see, I will not say more, but more intense and excessive pleasures in wantonness than in temperance?</div><div class="sentence"> Reflect before you speak.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">718</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I understand you, and see that there is a great difference between them; the temperate are restrained by the wise man's aphorism of 'Never too much,' which is their rule, but excess of pleasure possessing the minds of fools and wantons becomes madness and makes them shout with delight.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">719</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good, and if this be true, then the greatest pleasures and pains will clearly be found in some vicious state of soul and body, and not in a virtuous state.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">720</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">721</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And ought we not to select some of these for examination, and see what makes them the greatest?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">722</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure we ought.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">723</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Take the case of the pleasures which arise out of certain disorders.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">724</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What disorders?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">725</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The pleasures of unseemly disorders, which our severe friends utterly detest.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">726</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What pleasures?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">727</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Such, for example, as the relief of itching and other ailments by scratching, which is the only remedy required.</div><div class="sentence"> For what in Heaven's name is the feeling to be called which is thus produced in us?âPleasure or pain?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">728</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  A villainous mixture of some kind, Socrates, I should say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">729</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I did not introduce the argument, O Protarchus, with any personal reference to Philebus, but because, without the consideration of these and similar pleasures, we shall not be able to determine the point at issue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">730</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Then we had better proceed to analyze this family of pleasures.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">731</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You mean the pleasures which are mingled with pain?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">732</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">733</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There are some mixtures which are of the body, and only in the body, and others which are of the soul, and only in the soul; while there are other mixtures of pleasures with pains, common both to soul and body, which in their composite state are called sometimes pleasures and sometimes pains.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">734</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">735</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Whenever, in the restoration or in the derangement of nature, a man experiences two opposite feelings; for example, when he is cold and is growing warm, or again, when he is hot and is becoming cool, and he wants to have the one and be rid of the other;âthe sweet has a bitter, as the common saying is, and both together fasten upon him and create irritation and in time drive him to distraction.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">736</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  That description is very true to nature.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">737</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And in these sorts of mixtures the pleasures and pains are sometimes equal, and sometimes one or other of them predominates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">738</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">739</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Of cases in which the pain exceeds the pleasure, an example is afforded by itching, of which we were just now speaking, and by the tingling which we feel when the boiling and fiery element is within, and the rubbing and motion only relieves the surface, and does not reach the parts affected; then if you put them to the fire, and as a last resort apply cold to them, you may often produce the most intense pleasure or pain in the inner parts, which contrasts and mingles with the pain or pleasure, as the case may be, of the outer parts; and this is due to the forcible separation of what is united, or to the union of what is separated, and to the juxtaposition of pleasure and pain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">740</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">741</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Sometimes the element of pleasure prevails in a man, and the slight undercurrent of pain makes him tingle, and causes a gentle irritation; or again, the excessive infusion of pleasure creates an excitement in him,âhe even leaps for joy, he assumes all sorts of attitudes, he changes all manner of colours, he gasps for breath, and is quite amazed, and utters the most irrational exclamations.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">742</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, indeed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">743</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He will say of himself, and others will say of him, that he is dying with these delights; and the more dissipated and good-for-nothing he is, the more vehemently he pursues them in every way; of all pleasures he declares them to be the greatest; and he reckons him who lives in the most constant enjoyment of them to be the happiest of mankind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">744</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  That, Socrates, is a very true description of the opinions of the majority about pleasures.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">745</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Protarchus, quite true of the mixed pleasures, which arise out of the communion of external and internal sensations in the body; there are also cases in which the mind contributes an opposite element to the body, whether of pleasure or pain, and the two unite and form one mixture.</div><div class="sentence"> Concerning these I have already remarked, that when a man is empty he desires to be full, and has pleasure in hope and pain in vacuity.</div><div class="sentence"> But now I must further add what I omitted before, that in all these and similar emotions in which body and mind are opposed (and they are innumerable), pleasure and pain coalesce in one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">746</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I believe that to be quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">747</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There still remains one other sort of admixture of pleasures and pains.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">748</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">749</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The union which, as we were saying, the mind often experiences of purely mental feelings.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">750</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">751</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, do we not speak of anger, fear, desire, sorrow, love, emulation, envy, and the like, as pains which belong to the soul only?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">752</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">753</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And shall we not find them also full of the most wonderful pleasures?</div><div class="sentence"> need I remind you of the anger</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">754</span> <div class="sentence">  'Which stirs even a wise man to violence, And is sweeter than honey and the honeycomb?'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">755</span> <div class="sentence">  And you remember how pleasures mingle with pains in lamentation and bereavement?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">756</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, there is a natural connexion between them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">757</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And you remember also how at the sight of tragedies the spectators smile through their tears?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">758</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly I do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">759</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And are you aware that even at a comedy the soul experiences a mixed feeling of pain and pleasure?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">760</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I do not quite understand you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">761</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I admit, Protarchus, that there is some difficulty in recognizing this mixture of feelings at a comedy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">762</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  There is, I think.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">763</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the greater the obscurity of the case the more desirable is the examination of it, because the difficulty in detecting other cases of mixed pleasures and pains will be less.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">764</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Proceed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">765</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I have just mentioned envy; would you not call that a pain of the soul?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">766</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">767</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet the envious man finds something in the misfortunes of his neighbours at which he is pleased?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">768</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">769</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And ignorance, and what is termed clownishness, are surely an evil?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">770</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">771</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  From these considerations learn to know the nature of the ridiculous.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">772</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Explain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">773</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The ridiculous is in short the specific name which is used to describe the vicious form of a certain habit; and of vice in general it is that kind which is most at variance with the inscription at Delphi.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">774</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  You mean, Socrates, 'Know thyself.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">775</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I do; and the opposite would be, 'Know not thyself.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">776</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">777</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now, O Protarchus, try to divide this into three.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">778</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Indeed I am afraid that I cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">779</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do you mean to say that I must make the division for you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">780</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, and what is more, I beg that you will.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">781</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Are there not three ways in which ignorance of self may be shown?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">782</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What are they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">783</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In the first place, about money; the ignorant may fancy himself richer than he is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">784</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, that is a very common error.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">785</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And still more often he will fancy that he is taller or fairer than he is, or that he has some other advantage of person which he really has not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">786</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">787</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet surely by far the greatest number err about the goods of the mind; they imagine themselves to be much better men than they are.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">788</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, that is by far the commonest delusion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">789</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And of all the virtues, is not wisdom the one which the mass of mankind are always claiming, and which most arouses in them a spirit of contention and lying conceit of wisdom?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">790</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">791</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And may not all this be truly called an evil condition?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">792</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very evil.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">793</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But we must pursue the division a step further, Protarchus, if we would see in envy of the childish sort a singular mixture of pleasure and pain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">794</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How can we make the further division which you suggest?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">795</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  All who are silly enough to entertain this lying conceit of themselves may of course be divided, like the rest of mankind, into two classesâone having power and might; and the other the reverse.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">796</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">797</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let this, then, be the principle of division; those of them who are weak and unable to revenge themselves, when they are laughed at, may be truly called ridiculous, but those who can defend themselves may be more truly described as strong and formidable; for ignorance in the powerful is hateful and horrible, because hurtful to others both in reality and in fiction, but powerless ignorance may be reckoned, and in truth is, ridiculous.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">798</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is very true, but I do not as yet see where is the admixture of pleasures and pains.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">799</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, let us examine the nature of envy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">800</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Proceed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">801</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Is not envy an unrighteous pleasure, and also an unrighteous pain?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">802</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">803</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There is nothing envious or wrong in rejoicing at the misfortunes of enemies?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">804</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">805</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But to feel joy instead of sorrow at the sight of our friends' misfortunesâis not that wrong?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">806</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Undoubtedly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">807</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Did we not say that ignorance was always an evil?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">808</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">809</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the three kinds of vain conceit in our friends which we enumeratedâthe vain conceit of beauty, of wisdom, and of wealth, are ridiculous if they are weak, and detestable when they are powerful:  May we not say, as I was saying before, that our friends who are in this state of mind, when harmless to others, are simply ridiculous?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">810</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  They are ridiculous.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">811</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do we not acknowledge this ignorance of theirs to be a misfortune?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">812</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">813</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do we feel pain or pleasure in laughing at it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">814</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly we feel pleasure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">815</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And was not envy the source of this pleasure which we feel at the misfortunes of friends?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">816</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">817</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then the argument shows that when we laugh at the folly of our friends, pleasure, in mingling with envy, mingles with pain, for envy has been acknowledged by us to be mental pain, and laughter is pleasant; and so we envy and laugh at the same instant.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">818</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">819</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the argument implies that there are combinations of pleasure and pain in lamentations, and in tragedy and comedy, not only on the stage, but on the greater stage of human life; and so in endless other cases.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">820</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I do not see how any one can deny what you say, Socrates, however eager he may be to assert the opposite opinion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">821</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I mentioned anger, desire, sorrow, fear, love, emulation, envy, and similar emotions, as examples in which we should find a mixture of the two elements so often named; did I not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">822</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">823</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We may observe that our conclusions hitherto have had reference only to sorrow and envy and anger.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">824</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I see.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">825</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then many other cases still remain?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">826</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">827</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And why do you suppose me to have pointed out to you the admixture which takes place in comedy?</div><div class="sentence"> Why but to convince you that there was no difficulty in showing the mixed nature of fear and love and similar affections; and I thought that when I had given you the illustration, you would have let me off, and have acknowledged as a general truth that the body without the soul, and the soul without the body, as well as the two united, are susceptible of all sorts of admixtures of pleasures and pains; and so further discussion would have been unnecessary.</div><div class="sentence"> And now I want to know whether I may depart; or will you keep me here until midnight?</div><div class="sentence"> I fancy that I may obtain my release without many words;âif I promise that to-morrow I will give you an account of all these cases.</div><div class="sentence"> But at present I would rather sail in another direction, and go to other matters which remain to be settled, before the judgment can be given which Philebus demands.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">828</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good, Socrates; in what remains take your own course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">829</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then after the mixed pleasures the unmixed should have their turn; this is the natural and necessary order.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">830</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Excellent.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">831</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  These, in turn, then, I will now endeavour to indicate; for with the maintainers of the opinion that all pleasures are a cessation of pain, I do not agree, but, as I was saying, I use them as witnesses, that there are pleasures which seem only and are not, and there are others again which have great power and appear in many forms, yet are intermingled with pains, and are partly alleviations of agony and distress, both of body and mind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">832</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Then what pleasures, Socrates, should we be right in conceiving to be true?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">833</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True pleasures are those which are given by beauty of colour and form, and most of those which arise from smells; those of sound, again, and in general those of which the want is painless and unconscious, and of which the fruition is palpable to sense and pleasant and unalloyed with pain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">834</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Once more, Socrates, I must ask what you mean.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">835</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  My meaning is certainly not obvious, and I will endeavour to be plainer.</div><div class="sentence"> I do not mean by beauty of form such beauty as that of animals or pictures, which the many would suppose to be my meaning; but, says the argument, understand me to mean straight lines and circles, and the plane or solid figures which are formed out of them by turning-lathes and rulers and measurers of angles; for these I affirm to be not only relatively beautiful, like other things, but they are eternally and absolutely beautiful, and they have peculiar pleasures, quite unlike the pleasures of scratching.</div><div class="sentence"> And there are colours which are of the same character, and have similar pleasures; now do you understand my meaning?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">836</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I am trying to understand, Socrates, and I hope that you will try to make your meaning clearer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">837</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  When sounds are smooth and clear, and have a single pure tone, then I mean to say that they are not relatively but absolutely beautiful, and have natural pleasures associated with them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">838</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, there are such pleasures.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">839</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The pleasures of smell are of a less ethereal sort, but they have no necessary admixture of pain; and all pleasures, however and wherever experienced, which are unattended by pains, I assign to an analogous class.</div><div class="sentence"> Here then are two kinds of pleasures.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">840</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I understand.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">841</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  To these may be added the pleasures of knowledge, if no hunger of knowledge and no pain caused by such hunger precede them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">842</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  And this is the case.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">843</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but if a man who is full of knowledge loses his knowledge, are there not pains of forgetting?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">844</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Not necessarily, but there may be times of reflection, when he feels grief at the loss of his knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">845</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, my friend, but at present we are enumerating only the natural perceptions, and have nothing to do with reflection.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">846</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  In that case you are right in saying that the loss of knowledge is not attended with pain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">847</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  These pleasures of knowledge, then, are unmixed with pain; and they are not the pleasures of the many but of a very few.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">848</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">849</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now, having fairly separated the pure pleasures and those which may be rightly termed impure, let us further add to our description of them, that the pleasures which are in excess have no measure, but that those which are not in excess have measure; the great, the excessive, whether more or less frequent, we shall be right in referring to the class of the infinite, and of the more and less, which pours through body and soul alike; and the others we shall refer to the class which has measure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">850</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite right, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">851</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Still there is something more to be considered about pleasures.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">852</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">853</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  When you speak of purity and clearness, or of excess, abundance, greatness and sufficiency, in what relation do these terms stand to truth?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">854</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Why do you ask, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">855</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Because, Protarchus, I should wish to test pleasure and knowledge in every possible way, in order that if there be a pure and impure element in either of them, I may present the pure element for judgment, and then they will be more easily judged of by you and by me and by all of us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">856</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">857</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us investigate all the pure kinds; first selecting for consideration a single instance.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">858</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What instance shall we select?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">859</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Suppose that we first of all take whiteness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">860</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">861</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How can there be purity in whiteness, and what purity?</div><div class="sentence"> Is that purest which is greatest or most in quantity, or that which is most unadulterated and freest from any admixture of other colours?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">862</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly that which is most unadulterated.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">863</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True, Protarchus; and so the purest white, and not the greatest or largest in quantity, is to be deemed truest and most beautiful?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">864</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">865</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And we shall be quite right in saying that a little pure white is whiter and fairer and truer than a great deal that is mixed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">866</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Perfectly right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">867</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There is no need of adducing many similar examples in illustration of the argument about pleasure; one such is sufficient to prove to us that a small pleasure or a small amount of pleasure, if pure or unalloyed with pain, is always pleasanter and truer and fairer than a great pleasure or a great amount of pleasure of another kind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">868</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Assuredly; and the instance you have given is quite sufficient.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">869</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But what do you say of another question: âhave we not heard that pleasure is always a generation, and has no true being?</div><div class="sentence"> Do not certain ingenious philosophers teach this doctrine, and ought not we to be grateful to them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">870</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do they mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">871</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I will explain to you, my dear Protarchus, what they mean, by putting a question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">872</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Ask, and I will answer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">873</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I assume that there are two natures, one self-existent, and the other ever in want of something.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">874</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What manner of natures are they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">875</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The one majestic ever, the other inferior.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">876</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  You speak riddles.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">877</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You have seen loves good and fair, and also brave lovers of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">878</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should think so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">879</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Search the universe for two terms which are like these two and are present everywhere.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">880</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yet a third time I must say, Be a little plainer, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">881</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There is no difficulty, Protarchus; the argument is only in play, and insinuates that some things are for the sake of something else (relatives), and that other things are the ends to which the former class subserve (absolutes).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">882</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Your many repetitions make me slow to understand.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">883</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  As the argument proceeds, my boy, I dare say that the meaning will become clearer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">884</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very likely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">885</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Here are two new principles.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">886</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What are they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">887</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  One is the generation of all things, and the other is essence.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">888</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I readily accept from you both generation and essence.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">889</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very right; and would you say that generation is for the sake of essence, or essence for the sake of generation?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">890</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  You want to know whether that which is called essence is, properly speaking, for the sake of generation?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">891</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">892</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  By the gods, I wish that you would repeat your question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">893</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I mean, O my Protarchus, to ask whether you would tell me that ship-building is for the sake of ships, or ships for the sake of ship-building?</div><div class="sentence"> and in all similar cases I should ask the same question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">894</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Why do you not answer yourself, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">895</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I have no objection, but you must take your part.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">896</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">897</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  My answer is, that all things instrumental, remedial, material, are given to us with a view to generation, and that each generation is relative to, or for the sake of, some being or essence, and that the whole of generation is relative to the whole of essence.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">898</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Assuredly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">899</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then pleasure, being a generation, must surely be for the sake of some essence?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">900</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">901</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And that for the sake of which something else is done must be placed in the class of good, and that which is done for the sake of something else, in some other class, my good friend.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">902</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">903</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then pleasure, being a generation, will be rightly placed in some other class than that of good?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">904</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">905</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, as I said at first, we ought to be very grateful to him who first pointed out that pleasure was a generation only, and had no true being at all; for he is clearly one who laughs at the notion of pleasure being a good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">906</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Assuredly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">907</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And he would surely laugh also at those who make generation their highest end.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">908</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of whom are you speaking, and what do they mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">909</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I am speaking of those who when they are cured of hunger or thirst or any other defect by some process of generation are delighted at the process as if it were pleasure; and they say that they would not wish to live without these and other feelings of a like kind which might be mentioned.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">910</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is certainly what they appear to think.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">911</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is not destruction universally admitted to be the opposite of generation?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">912</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">913</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then he who chooses thus, would choose generation and destruction rather than that third sort of life, in which, as we were saying, was neither pleasure nor pain, but only the purest possible thought.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">914</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  He who would make us believe pleasure to be a good is involved in great absurdities, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">915</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Great, indeed; and there is yet another of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">916</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">917</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Is there not an absurdity in arguing that there is nothing good or noble in the body, or in anything else, but that good is in the soul only, and that the only good of the soul is pleasure; and that courage or temperance or understanding, or any other good of the soul, is not really a good?âand is there not yet a further absurdity in our being compelled to say that he who has a feeling of pain and not of pleasure is bad at the time when he is suffering pain, even though he be the best of men; and again, that he who has a feeling of pleasure, in so far as he is pleased at the time when he is pleased, in that degree excels in virtue?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">918</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Nothing, Socrates, can be more irrational than all this.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">919</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now, having subjected pleasure to every sort of test, let us not appear to be too sparing of mind and knowledge:  let us ring their metal bravely, and see if there be unsoundness in any part, until we have found out what in them is of the purest nature; and then the truest elements both of pleasure and knowledge may be brought up for judgment.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">920</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">921</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Knowledge has two parts,âthe one productive, and the other educational?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">922</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">924</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">925</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us separate the superior or dominant elements in each of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">926</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What are they, and how do you separate them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">927</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I mean to say, that if arithmetic, mensuration, and weighing be taken away from any art, that which remains will not be much.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">928</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Not much, certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">929</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The rest will be only conjecture, and the better use of the senses which is given by experience and practice, in addition to a certain power of guessing, which is commonly called art, and is perfected by attention and pains.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">930</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Nothing more, assuredly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">931</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Music, for instance, is full of this empiricism; for sounds are harmonized, not by measure, but by skilful conjecture; the music of the flute is always trying to guess the pitch of each vibrating note, and is therefore mixed up with much that is doubtful and has little which is certain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">932</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">933</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the same will be found to hold good of medicine and husbandry and piloting and generalship.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">934</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">935</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The art of the builder, on the other hand, which uses a number of measures and instruments, attains by their help to a greater degree of accuracy than the other arts.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">936</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">937</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In ship-building and house-building, and in other branches of the art of carpentering, the builder has his rule, lathe, compass, line, and a most ingenious machine for straightening wood.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">938</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">939</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then now let us divide the arts of which we were speaking into two kinds,âthe arts which, like music, are less exact in their results, and those which, like carpentering, are more exact.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">940</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Let us make that division.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">941</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Of the latter class, the most exact of all are those which we just now spoke of as primary.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">942</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I see that you mean arithmetic, and the kindred arts of weighing and measuring.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">943</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly, Protarchus; but are not these also distinguishable into two kinds?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">944</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What are the two kinds?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">945</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In the first place, arithmetic is of two kinds, one of which is popular, and the other philosophical.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">946</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How would you distinguish them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">947</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There is a wide difference between them, Protarchus; some arithmeticians reckon unequal units; as for example, two armies, two oxen, two very large things or two very small things.</div><div class="sentence"> The party who are opposed to them insist that every unit in ten thousand must be the same as every other unit.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">948</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Undoubtedly there is, as you say, a great difference among the votaries of the science; and there may be reasonably supposed to be two sorts of arithmetic.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">949</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And when we compare the art of mensuration which is used in building with philosophical geometry, or the art of computation which is used in trading with exact calculation, shall we say of either of the pairs that it is one or two?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">950</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  On the analogy of what has preceded, I should be of opinion that they were severally two.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">951</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Right; but do you understand why I have discussed the subject?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">952</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I think so, but I should like to be told by you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">953</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The argument has all along been seeking a parallel to pleasure, and true to that original design, has gone on to ask whether one sort of knowledge is purer than another, as one pleasure is purer than another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">954</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly; that was the intention.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">955</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And has not the argument in what has preceded, already shown that the arts have different provinces, and vary in their degrees of certainty?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">956</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">957</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And just now did not the argument first designate a particular art by a common term, thus making us believe in the unity of that art; and then again, as if speaking of two different things, proceed to enquire whether the art as pursed by philosophers, or as pursued by non-philosophers, has more of certainty and purity?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">958</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is the very question which the argument is asking.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">959</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And how, Protarchus, shall we answer the enquiry?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">960</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  O Socrates, we have reached a point at which the difference of clearness in different kinds of knowledge is enormous.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">961</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then the answer will be the easier.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">962</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly; and let us say in reply, that those arts into which arithmetic and mensuration enter, far surpass all others; and that of these the arts or sciences which are animated by the pure philosophic impulse are infinitely superior in accuracy and truth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">963</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then this is your judgment; and this is the answer which, upon your authority, we will give to all masters of the art of misinterpretation?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">964</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What answer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">965</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That there are two arts of arithmetic, and two of mensuration; and also several other arts which in like manner have this double nature, and yet only one name.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">966</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Let us boldly return this answer to the masters of whom you speak, Socrates, and hope for good luck.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">967</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We have explained what we term the most exact arts or sciences.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">968</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">969</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet, Protarchus, dialectic will refuse to acknowledge us, if we do not award to her the first place.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">970</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  And pray, what is dialectic?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">971</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly the science which has to do with all that knowledge of which we are now speaking; for I am sure that all men who have a grain of intelligence will admit that the knowledge which has to do with being and reality, and sameness and unchangeableness, is by far the truest of all.</div><div class="sentence"> But how would you decide this question, Protarchus?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">972</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I have often heard Gorgias maintain, Socrates, that the art of persuasion far surpassed every other; this, as he says, is by far the best of them all, for to it all things submit, not by compulsion, but of their own free will.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, I should not like to quarrel either with you or with him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">973</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You mean to say that you would like to desert, if you were not ashamed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">974</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  As you please.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">975</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  May I not have led you into a misapprehension?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">976</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">977</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Dear Protarchus, I never asked which was the greatest or best or usefullest of arts or sciences, but which had clearness and accuracy, and the greatest amount of truth, however humble and little useful an art.</div><div class="sentence"> And as for Gorgias, if you do not deny that his art has the advantage in usefulness to mankind, he will not quarrel with you for saying that the study of which I am speaking is superior in this particular of essential truth; as in the comparison of white colours, a little whiteness, if that little be only pure, was said to be superior in truth to a great mass which is impure.</div><div class="sentence"> And now let us give our best attention and consider well, not the comparative use or reputation of the sciences, but the power or faculty, if there be such, which the soul has of loving the truth, and of doing all things for the sake of it; let us search into the pure element of mind and intelligence, and then we shall be able to say whether the science of which I have been speaking is most likely to possess the faculty, or whether there be some other which has higher claims.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">978</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Well, I have been considering, and I can hardly think that any other science or art has a firmer grasp of the truth than this.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">979</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do you say so because you observe that the arts in general and those engaged in them make use of opinion, and are resolutely engaged in the investigation of matters of opinion?</div><div class="sentence"> Even he who supposes himself to be occupied with nature is really occupied with the things of this world, how created, how acting or acted upon.</div><div class="sentence"> Is not this the sort of enquiry in which his life is spent?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">980</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">981</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He is labouring, not after eternal being, but about things which are becoming, or which will or have become.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">982</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">983</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And can we say that any of these things which neither are nor have been nor will be unchangeable, when judged by the strict rule of truth ever become certain?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">984</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">985</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How can anything fixed be concerned with that which has no fixedness?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">986</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How indeed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">987</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then mind and science when employed about such changing things do not attain the highest truth?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">988</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should imagine not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">989</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now let us bid farewell, a long farewell, to you or me or Philebus or Gorgias, and urge on behalf of the argument a single point.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">990</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What point?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">991</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us say that the stable and pure and true and unalloyed has to do with the things which are eternal and unchangeable and unmixed, or if not, at any rate what is most akin to them has; and that all other things are to be placed in a second or inferior class.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">992</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">993</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And of the names expressing cognition, ought not the fairest to be given to the fairest things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">994</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is natural.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">995</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And are not mind and wisdom the names which are to be honoured most?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">996</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">997</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And these names may be said to have their truest and most exact application when the mind is engaged in the contemplation of true being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">998</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">999</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And these were the names which I adduced of the rivals of pleasure?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1000</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1001</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In the next place, as to the mixture, here are the ingredients, pleasure and wisdom, and we may be compared to artists who have their materials ready to their hands.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1002</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1003</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now we must begin to mix them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1004</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1005</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But had we not better have a preliminary word and refresh our memories?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1006</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Of what?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1007</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Of that which I have already mentioned.</div><div class="sentence"> Well says the proverb, that we ought to repeat twice and even thrice that which is good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1008</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1009</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well then, by Zeus, let us proceed, and I will make what I believe to be a fair summary of the argument.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1010</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Let me hear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1011</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Philebus says that pleasure is the true end of all living beings, at which all ought to aim, and moreover that it is the chief good of all, and that the two names 'good' and 'pleasant' are correctly given to one thing and one nature; Socrates, on the other hand, begins by denying this, and further says, that in nature as in name they are two, and that wisdom partakes more than pleasure of the good.</div><div class="sentence"> Is not and was not this what we were saying, Protarchus?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1012</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1013</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is there not and was there not a further point which was conceded between us?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1014</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What was it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1015</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That the good differs from all other things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1016</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  In what respect?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1017</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In that the being who possesses good always everywhere and in all things has the most perfect sufficiency, and is never in need of anything else.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1018</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1019</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And did we not endeavour to make an imaginary separation of wisdom and pleasure, assigning to each a distinct life, so that pleasure was wholly excluded from wisdom, and wisdom in like manner had no part whatever in pleasure?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1020</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  We did.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1021</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And did we think that either of them alone would be sufficient?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1022</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1023</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if we erred in any point, then let any one who will, take up the enquiry again and set us right; and assuming memory and wisdom and knowledge and true opinion to belong to the same class, let him consider whether he would desire to possess or acquire,âI will not say pleasure, however abundant or intense, if he has no real perception that he is pleased, nor any consciousness of what he feels, nor any recollection, however momentary, of the feeling,âbut would he desire to have anything at all, if these faculties were wanting to him?</div><div class="sentence"> And about wisdom I ask the same question; can you conceive that any one would choose to have all wisdom absolutely devoid of pleasure, rather than with a certain degree of pleasure, or all pleasure devoid of wisdom, rather than with a certain degree of wisdom?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1024</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not, Socrates; but why repeat such questions any more?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1025</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then the perfect and universally eligible and entirely good cannot possibly be either of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1026</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1027</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then now we must ascertain the nature of the good more or less accurately, in order, as we were saying, that the second place may be duly assigned.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1028</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1029</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Have we not found a road which leads towards the good?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1030</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What road?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1031</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Supposing that a man had to be found, and you could discover in what house he lived, would not that be a great step towards the discovery of the man himself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1032</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1033</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now reason intimates to us, as at our first beginning, that we should seek the good, not in the unmixed life but in the mixed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1034</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1035</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There is greater hope of finding that which we are seeking in the life which is well mixed than in that which is not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1036</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Far greater.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1037</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then now let us mingle, Protarchus, at the same time offering up a prayer to Dionysus or Hephaestus, or whoever is the god who presides over the ceremony of mingling.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1038</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1039</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Are not we the cup-bearers?</div><div class="sentence"> and here are two fountains which are flowing at our side:  one, which is pleasure, may be likened to a fountain of honey; the other, wisdom, a sober draught in which no wine mingles, is of water unpleasant but healthful; out of these we must seek to make the fairest of all possible mixtures.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1040</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1041</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Tell me first;âshould we be most likely to succeed if we mingled every sort of pleasure with every sort of wisdom?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1042</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Perhaps we might.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1043</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But I should be afraid of the risk, and I think that I can show a safer plan.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1044</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1045</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  One pleasure was supposed by us to be truer than another, and one art to be more exact than another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1046</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1047</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There was also supposed to be a difference in sciences; some of them regarding only the transient and perishing, and others the permanent and imperishable and everlasting and immutable; and when judged by the standard of truth, the latter, as we thought, were truer than the former.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1048</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good and right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1049</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  If, then, we were to begin by mingling the sections of each class which have the most of truth, will not the union suffice to give us the loveliest of lives, or shall we still want some elements of another kind?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1050</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I think that we ought to do what you suggest.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1053</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Will he have enough of knowledge if he is acquainted only with the divine circle and sphere, and knows nothing of our human spheres and circles, but uses only divine circles and measures in the building of a house?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1054</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  The knowledge which is only superhuman, Socrates, is ridiculous in man.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1055</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div><div class="sentence"> Do you mean that you are to throw into the cup and mingle the impure and uncertain art which uses the false measure and the false circle?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1056</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, we must, if any of us is ever to find his way home.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1057</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And am I to include music, which, as I was saying just now, is full of guesswork and imitation, and is wanting in purity?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1058</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I think that you must, if human life is to be a life at all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1059</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, suppose that I give way, and, like a doorkeeper who is pushed and overborne by the mob, I open the door wide, and let knowledge of every sort stream in, and the pure mingle with the impure?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1060</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I do not know, Socrates, that any great harm would come of having them all, if only you have the first sort.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1061</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, shall I let them all flow into what Homer poetically terms 'a meeting of the waters'?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1062</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1063</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  ThereâI have let them in, and now I must return to the fountain of pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> For we were not permitted to begin by mingling in a single stream the true portions of both according to our original intention; but the love of all knowledge constrained us to let all the sciences flow in together before the pleasures.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1064</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1065</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now the time has come for us to consider about the pleasures also, whether we shall in like manner let them go all at once, or at first only the true ones.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1066</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  It will be by far the safer course to let flow the true ones first.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1067</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let them flow, then; and now, if there are any necessary pleasures, as there were arts and sciences necessary, must we not mingle them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1068</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; the necessary pleasures should certainly be allowed to mingle.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1069</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The knowledge of the arts has been admitted to be innocent and useful always; and if we say of pleasures in like manner that all of them are good and innocent for all of us at all times, we must let them all mingle?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1070</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What shall we say about them, and what course shall we take?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1071</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do not ask me, Protarchus; but ask the daughters of pleasure and wisdom to answer for themselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1072</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1073</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Tell us, O belovedâshall we call you pleasures or by some other name?âwould you rather live with or without wisdom?</div><div class="sentence"> I am of opinion that they would certainly answer as follows:</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1074</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1075</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  They would answer, as we said before, that for any single class to be left by itself pure and isolated is not good, nor altogether possible; and that if we are to make comparisons of one class with another and choose, there is no better companion than knowledge of things in general, and likewise the perfect knowledge, if that may be, of ourselves in every respect.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1076</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  And our answer will be: âIn that ye have spoken well.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1077</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div><div class="sentence"> And now let us go back and interrogate wisdom and mind:  Would you like to have any pleasures in the mixture?</div><div class="sentence"> And they will reply: â'What pleasures do you mean?'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1078</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Likely enough.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1079</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And we shall take up our parable and say:  Do you wish to have the greatest and most vehement pleasures for your companions in addition to the true ones?</div><div class="sentence"> 'Why, Socrates,' they will say, 'how can we?</div><div class="sentence"> seeing that they are the source of ten thousand hindrances to us; they trouble the souls of men, which are our habitation, with their madness; they prevent us from coming to the birth, and are commonly the ruin of the children which are born to us, causing them to be forgotten and unheeded; but the true and pure pleasures, of which you spoke, know to be of our family, and also those pleasures which accompany health and temperance, and which every Virtue, like a goddess, has in her train to follow her about wherever she goes,âmingle these and not the others; there would be great want of sense in any one who desires to see a fair and perfect mixture, and to find in it what is the highest good in man and in the universe, and to divine what is the true form of goodâthere would be great want of sense in his allowing the pleasures, which are always in the company of folly and vice, to mingle with mind in the cup.</div><div class="sentence"> 'âIs not this a very rational and suitable reply, which mind has made, both on her own behalf, as well as on the behalf of memory and true opinion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1080</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1081</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And still there must be something more added, which is a necessary ingredient in every mixture.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1082</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1083</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Unless truth enter into the composition, nothing can truly be created or subsist.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1084</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1085</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Quite impossible; and now you and Philebus must tell me whether anything is still wanting in the mixture, for to my way of thinking the argument is now completed, and may be compared to an incorporeal law, which is going to hold fair rule over a living body.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1086</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I agree with you, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1087</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And may we not say with reason that we are now at the vestibule of the habitation of the good?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1088</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I think that we are.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1089</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What, then, is there in the mixture which is most precious, and which is the principal cause why such a state is universally beloved by all?</div><div class="sentence"> When we have discovered it, we will proceed to ask whether this omnipresent nature is more akin to pleasure or to mind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1090</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite right; in that way we shall be better able to judge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1091</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And there is no difficulty in seeing the cause which renders any mixture either of the highest value or of none at all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1092</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1093</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Every man knows it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1094</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1095</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He knows that any want of measure and symmetry in any mixture whatever must always of necessity be fatal, both to the elements and to the mixture, which is then not a mixture, but only a confused medley which brings confusion on the possessor of it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1096</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1097</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now the power of the good has retired into the region of the beautiful; for measure and symmetry are beauty and virtue all the world over.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1098</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1099</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Also we said that truth was to form an element in the mixture.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1100</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1101</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, if we are not able to hunt the good with one idea only, with three we may catch our prey; Beauty, Symmetry, Truth are the three, and these taken together we may regard as the single cause of the mixture, and the mixture as being good by reason of the infusion of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1102</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1103</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now, Protarchus, any man could decide well enough whether pleasure or wisdom is more akin to the highest good, and more honourable among gods and men.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1104</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly, and yet perhaps the argument had better be pursued to the end.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1105</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We must take each of them separately in their relation to pleasure and mind, and pronounce upon them; for we ought to see to which of the two they are severally most akin.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1106</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  You are speaking of beauty, truth, and measure?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1107</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Protarchus, take truth first, and, after passing in review mind, truth, pleasure, pause awhile and make answer to yourselfâas to whether pleasure or mind is more akin to truth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1108</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  There is no need to pause, for the difference between them is palpable; pleasure is the veriest impostor in the world; and it is said that in the pleasures of love, which appear to be the greatest, perjury is excused by the gods; for pleasures, like children, have not the least particle of reason in them; whereas mind is either the same as truth, or the most like truth, and the truest.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1109</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Shall we next consider measure, in like manner, and ask whether pleasure has more of this than wisdom, or wisdom than pleasure?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1110</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Here is another question which may be easily answered; for I imagine that nothing can ever be more immoderate than the transports of pleasure, or more in conformity with measure than mind and knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1111</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good; but there still remains the third test:  Has mind a greater share of beauty than pleasure, and is mind or pleasure the fairer of the two?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1112</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  No one, Socrates, either awake or dreaming, ever saw or imagined mind or wisdom to be in aught unseemly, at any time, past, present, or future.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1113</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1114</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  But when we see some one indulging in pleasures, perhaps in the greatest of pleasures, the ridiculous or disgraceful nature of the action makes us ashamed; and so we put them out of sight, and consign them to darkness, under the idea that they ought not to meet the eye of day.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1115</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, Protarchus, you will proclaim everywhere, by word of mouth to this company, and by messengers bearing the tidings far and wide, that pleasure is not the first of possessions, nor yet the second, but that in measure, and the mean, and the suitable, and the like, the eternal nature has been found.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1116</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, that seems to be the result of what has been now said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1117</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In the second class is contained the symmetrical and beautiful and perfect or sufficient, and all which are of that family.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1118</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1119</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if you reckon in the third class mind and wisdom, you will not be far wrong, if I divine aright.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1120</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I dare say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1121</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And would you not put in the fourth class the goods which we were affirming to appertain specially to the soulâsciences and arts and true opinions as we called them?</div><div class="sentence"> These come after the third class, and form the fourth, as they are certainly more akin to good than pleasure is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1122</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Surely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1123</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The fifth class are the pleasures which were defined by us as painless, being the pure pleasures of the soul herself, as we termed them, which accompany, some the sciences, and some the senses.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1124</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Perhaps.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1125</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now, as Orpheus says,</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1126</span> <div class="sentence">  Here, at the sixth award, let us make an end; all that remains is to set the crown on our discourse.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1127</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1128</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then let us sum up and reassert what has been said, thus offering the third libation to the saviour Zeus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1129</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  How?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1130</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Philebus affirmed that pleasure was always and absolutely the good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1131</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  I understand; this third libation, Socrates, of which you spoke, meant a recapitulation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1132</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, but listen to the sequel; convinced of what I have just been saying, and feeling indignant at the doctrine, which is maintained, not by Philebus only, but by thousands of others, I affirmed that mind was far better and far more excellent, as an element of human life, than pleasure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1133</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1134</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But, suspecting that there were other things which were also better, I went on to say that if there was anything better than either, then I would claim the second place for mind over pleasure, and pleasure would lose the second place as well as the first.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1135</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  You did.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1136</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Nothing could be more satisfactorily shown than the unsatisfactory nature of both of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1137</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1138</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The claims both of pleasure and mind to be the absolute good have been entirely disproven in this argument, because they are both wanting in self-sufficiency and also in adequacy and perfection.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1139</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1140</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But, though they must both resign in favour of another, mind is ten thousand times nearer and more akin to the nature of the conqueror than pleasure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1141</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1142</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And, according to the judgment which has now been given, pleasure will rank fifth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1143</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1144</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But not first; no, not even if all the oxen and horses and animals in the world by their pursuit of enjoyment proclaim her to be so;âalthough the many trusting in them, as diviners trust in birds, determine that pleasures make up the good of life, and deem the lusts of animals to be better witnesses than the inspirations of divine philosophy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1145</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  And now, Socrates, we tell you that the truth of what you have been saying is approved by the judgment of all of us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1146</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And will you let me go?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1147</span><div class="speaker">PROTARCHUS</div><div class="sentence">  There is a little which yet remains, and I will remind you of it, for I am sure that you will not be the first to go away from an argument.</div></div>
