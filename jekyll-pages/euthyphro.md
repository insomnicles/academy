<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  In the Meno, Anytus had parted from Socrates with the significant words: 'That in any city, and particularly in the city of Athens, it is easier to do men harm than to do them good;' and Socrates was anticipating another opportunity of talking with him.</div><div class="sentence"> In the Euthyphro, Socrates is awaiting his trial for impiety.</div><div class="sentence"> But before the trial begins, Plato would like to put the world on their trial, and convince them of ignorance in that very matter touching which Socrates is accused.</div><div class="sentence"> An incident which may perhaps really have occurred in the family of Euthyphro, a learned Athenian diviner and soothsayer, furnishes the occasion of the discussion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  This Euthyphro and Socrates are represented as meeting in the porch of the King Archon.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Theaet.)</div><div class="sentence"> Both have legal business in hand.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates is defendant in a suit for impiety which Meletus has brought against him (it is remarked by the way that he is not a likely man himself to have brought a suit against another); and Euthyphro too is plaintiff in an action for murder, which he has brought against his own father.</div><div class="sentence"> The latter has originated in the following manner:—A poor dependant of the family had slain one of their domestic slaves in Naxos.</div><div class="sentence"> The guilty person was bound and thrown into a ditch by the command of Euthyphro's father, who sent to the interpreters of religion at Athens to ask what should be done with him.</div><div class="sentence"> Before the messenger came back the criminal had died from hunger and exposure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  This is the origin of the charge of murder which Euthyphro brings against his father.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates is confident that before he could have undertaken the responsibility of such a prosecution, he must have been perfectly informed of the nature of piety and impiety; and as he is going to be tried for impiety himself, he thinks that he cannot do better than learn of Euthyphro (who will be admitted by everybody, including the judges, to be an unimpeachable authority) what piety is, and what is impiety.</div><div class="sentence"> What then is piety?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  Euthyphro, who, in the abundance of his knowledge, is very willing to undertake all the responsibility, replies: That piety is doing as I do, prosecuting your father (if he is guilty) on a charge of murder; doing as the gods do—as Zeus did to Cronos, and Cronos to Uranus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates has a dislike to these tales of mythology, and he fancies that this dislike of his may be the reason why he is charged with impiety.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Are they really true?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Yes, they are;' and Euthyphro will gladly tell Socrates some more of them.</div><div class="sentence"> But Socrates would like first of all to have a more satisfactory answer to the question, 'What is piety?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Doing as I do, charging a father with murder,' may be a single instance of piety, but can hardly be regarded as a general definition.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  Euthyphro replies, that 'Piety is what is dear to the gods, and impiety is what is not dear to them.'</div><div class="sentence"> But may there not be differences of opinion, as among men, so also among the gods?</div><div class="sentence"> Especially, about good and evil, which have no fixed rule; and these are precisely the sort of differences which give rise to quarrels.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore what may be dear to one god may not be dear to another, and the same action may be both pious and impious; e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> your chastisement of your father, Euthyphro, may be dear or pleasing to Zeus (who inflicted a similar chastisement on his own father), but not equally pleasing to Cronos or Uranus (who suffered at the hands of their sons).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  Euthyphro answers that there is no difference of opinion, either among gods or men, as to the propriety of punishing a murderer.</div><div class="sentence"> Yes, rejoins Socrates, when they know him to be a murderer; but you are assuming the point at issue.</div><div class="sentence"> If all the circumstances of the case are considered, are you able to show that your father was guilty of murder, or that all the gods are agreed in approving of our prosecution of him?</div><div class="sentence"> And must you not allow that what is hated by one god may be liked by another?</div><div class="sentence"> Waiving this last, however, Socrates proposes to amend the definition, and say that 'what all the gods love is pious, and what they all hate is impious.'</div><div class="sentence"> To this Euthyphro agrees.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates proceeds to analyze the new form of the definition.</div><div class="sentence"> He shows that in other cases the act precedes the state; e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> the act of being carried, loved, etc.</div><div class="sentence"> precedes the state of being carried, loved, etc., and therefore that which is dear to the gods is dear to the gods because it is first loved of them, not loved of them because it is dear to them.</div><div class="sentence"> But the pious or holy is loved by the gods because it is pious or holy, which is equivalent to saying, that it is loved by them because it is dear to them.</div><div class="sentence"> Here then appears to be a contradiction,—Euthyphro has been giving an attribute or accident of piety only, and not the essence.</div><div class="sentence"> Euthyphro acknowledges himself that his explanations seem to walk away or go round in a circle, like the moving figures of Daedalus, the ancestor of Socrates, who has communicated his art to his descendants.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates, who is desirous of stimulating the indolent intelligence of Euthyphro, raises the question in another manner: 'Is all the pious just?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Yes.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Is all the just pious?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'No.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Then what part of justice is piety?'</div><div class="sentence"> Euthyphro replies that piety is that part of justice which 'attends' to the gods, as there is another part of justice which 'attends' to men.</div><div class="sentence"> But what is the meaning of 'attending' to the gods?</div><div class="sentence"> The word 'attending,' when applied to dogs, horses, and men, implies that in some way they are made better.</div><div class="sentence"> But how do pious or holy acts make the gods any better?</div><div class="sentence"> Euthyphro explains that he means by pious acts, acts of service or ministration.</div><div class="sentence"> Yes; but the ministrations of the husbandman, the physician, and the builder have an end.</div><div class="sentence"> To what end do we serve the gods, and what do we help them to accomplish?</div><div class="sentence"> Euthyphro replies, that all these difficult questions cannot be resolved in a short time; and he would rather say simply that piety is knowing how to please the gods in word and deed, by prayers and sacrifices.</div><div class="sentence"> In other words, says Socrates, piety is 'a science of asking and giving'—asking what we want and giving what they want; in short, a mode of doing business between gods and men.</div><div class="sentence"> But although they are the givers of all good, how can we give them any good in return?</div><div class="sentence"> 'Nay, but we give them honour.'</div><div class="sentence"> Then we give them not what is beneficial, but what is pleasing or dear to them; and this is the point which has been already disproved.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates, although weary of the subterfuges and evasions of Euthyphro, remains unshaken in his conviction that he must know the nature of piety, or he would never have prosecuted his old father.</div><div class="sentence"> He is still hoping that he will condescend to instruct him.</div><div class="sentence"> But Euthyphro is in a hurry and cannot stay.</div><div class="sentence"> And Socrates' last hope of knowing the nature of piety before he is prosecuted for impiety has disappeared.</div><div class="sentence"> As in the Euthydemus the irony is carried on to the end.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span> <div class="sentence">  The Euthyphro is manifestly designed to contrast the real nature of piety and impiety with the popular conceptions of them.</div><div class="sentence"> But when the popular conceptions of them have been overthrown, Socrates does not offer any definition of his own: as in the Laches and Lysis, he prepares the way for an answer to the question which he has raised; but true to his own character, refuses to answer himself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span> <div class="sentence">  Euthyphro is a religionist, and is elsewhere spoken of, if he be the same person, as the author of a philosophy of names, by whose 'prancing steeds' Socrates in the Cratylus is carried away.</div><div class="sentence"> He has the conceit and self-confidence of a Sophist; no doubt that he is right in prosecuting his father has ever entered into his mind.</div><div class="sentence"> Like a Sophist too, he is incapable either of framing a general definition or of following the course of an argument.</div><div class="sentence"> His wrong-headedness, one-sidedness, narrowness, positiveness, are characteristic of his priestly office.</div><div class="sentence"> His failure to apprehend an argument may be compared to a similar defect which is observable in the rhapsode Ion.</div><div class="sentence"> But he is not a bad man, and he is friendly to Socrates, whose familiar sign he recognizes with interest.</div><div class="sentence"> Though unable to follow him he is very willing to be led by him, and eagerly catches at any suggestion which saves him from the trouble of thinking.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover he is the enemy of Meletus, who, as he says, is availing himself of the popular dislike to innovations in religion in order to injure Socrates; at the same time he is amusingly confident that he has weapons in his own armoury which would be more than a match for him.</div><div class="sentence"> He is quite sincere in his prosecution of his father, who has accidentally been guilty of homicide, and is not wholly free from blame.</div><div class="sentence"> To purge away the crime appears to him in the light of a duty, whoever may be the criminal.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span> <div class="sentence">  Thus begins the contrast between the religion of the letter, or of the narrow and unenlightened conscience, and the higher notion of religion which Socrates vainly endeavours to elicit from him.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Piety is doing as I do' is the idea of religion which first occurs to him, and to many others who do not say what they think with equal frankness.</div><div class="sentence"> For men are not easily persuaded that any other religion is better than their own; or that other nations, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> the Greeks in the time of Socrates, were equally serious in their religious beliefs and difficulties.</div><div class="sentence"> The chief difference between us and them is, that they were slowly learning what we are in process of forgetting.</div><div class="sentence"> Greek mythology hardly admitted of the distinction between accidental homicide and murder: that the pollution of blood was the same in both cases is also the feeling of the Athenian diviner.</div><div class="sentence"> He had not as yet learned the lesson, which philosophy was teaching, that Homer and Hesiod, if not banished from the state, or whipped out of the assembly, as Heracleitus more rudely proposed, at any rate were not to be appealed to as authorities in religion; and he is ready to defend his conduct by the examples of the gods.</div><div class="sentence"> These are the very tales which Socrates cannot abide; and his dislike of them, as he suspects, has branded him with the reputation of impiety.</div><div class="sentence"> Here is one answer to the question, 'Why Socrates was put to death,' suggested by the way.</div><div class="sentence"> Another is conveyed in the words, 'The Athenians do not care about any man being thought wise until he begins to make other men wise; and then for some reason or other they are angry:' which may be said to be the rule of popular toleration in most other countries, and not at Athens only.</div><div class="sentence"> In the course of the argument Socrates remarks that the controversial nature of morals and religion arises out of the difficulty of verifying them.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no measure or standard to which they can be referred.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span> <div class="sentence">  The next definition, 'Piety is that which is loved of the gods,' is shipwrecked on a refined distinction between the state and the act, corresponding respectively to the adjective (philon) and the participle (philoumenon), or rather perhaps to the participle and the verb (philoumenon and phileitai).</div><div class="sentence"> The act is prior to the state (as in Aristotle the energeia precedes the dunamis); and the state of being loved is preceded by the act of being loved.</div><div class="sentence"> But piety or holiness is preceded by the act of being pious, not by the act of being loved; and therefore piety and the state of being loved are different.</div><div class="sentence"> Through such subtleties of dialectic Socrates is working his way into a deeper region of thought and feeling.</div><div class="sentence"> He means to say that the words 'loved of the gods' express an attribute only, and not the essence of piety.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span> <div class="sentence">  Then follows the third and last definition, 'Piety is a part of justice.'</div><div class="sentence"> Thus far Socrates has proceeded in placing religion on a moral foundation.</div><div class="sentence"> He is seeking to realize the harmony of religion and morality, which the great poets Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Pindar had unconsciously anticipated, and which is the universal want of all men.</div><div class="sentence"> To this the soothsayer adds the ceremonial element, 'attending upon the gods.'</div><div class="sentence"> When further interrogated by Socrates as to the nature of this 'attention to the gods,' he replies, that piety is an affair of business, a science of giving and asking, and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates points out the anthropomorphism of these notions, (compare Symp.</div><div class="sentence"> ; Republic; Politicus.)</div><div class="sentence"> But when we expect him to go on and show that the true service of the gods is the service of the spirit and the co-operation with them in all things true and good, he stops short; this was a lesson which the soothsayer could not have been made to understand, and which every one must learn for himself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span> <div class="sentence">  There seem to be altogether three aims or interests in this little Dialogue: (1) the dialectical development of the idea of piety; (2) the antithesis of true and false religion, which is carried to a certain extent only; (3) the defence of Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span> <div class="sentence">  The subtle connection with the Apology and the Crito; the holding back of the conclusion, as in the Charmides, Lysis, Laches, Protagoras, and other Dialogues; the deep insight into the religious world; the dramatic power and play of the two characters; the inimitable irony, are reasons for believing that the Euthyphro is a genuine Platonic writing.</div><div class="sentence"> The spirit in which the popular representations of mythology are denounced recalls Republic II.</div><div class="sentence"> The virtue of piety has been already mentioned as one of five in the Protagoras, but is not reckoned among the four cardinal virtues of Republic IV.</div><div class="sentence"> The figure of Daedalus has occurred in the Meno; that of Proteus in the Euthydemus and Io.</div><div class="sentence"> The kingly science has already appeared in the Euthydemus, and will reappear in the Republic and Statesman.</div><div class="sentence"> But neither from these nor any other indications of similarity or difference, and still less from arguments respecting the suitableness of this little work to aid Socrates at the time of his trial or the reverse, can any evidence of the date be obtained.</div></div>

</div><div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Why have you left the Lyceum, Socrates?</div><div class="sentence"> and what are you doing in the Porch of the King Archon?</div><div class="sentence"> Surely you cannot be concerned in a suit before the King, like myself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Not in a suit, Euthyphro; impeachment is the word which the Athenians use.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  What!</div><div class="sentence"> I suppose that some one has been prosecuting you, for I cannot believe that you are the prosecutor of another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Then some one else has been prosecuting you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  And who is he?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  A young man who is little known, Euthyphro; and I hardly know him:  his name is Meletus, and he is of the deme of Pitthis.</div><div class="sentence"> Perhaps you may remember his appearance; he has a beak, and long straight hair, and a beard which is ill grown.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  No, I do not remember him, Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> But what is the charge which he brings against you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What is the charge?</div><div class="sentence"> Well, a very serious charge, which shows a good deal of character in the young man, and for which he is certainly not to be despised.</div><div class="sentence"> He says he knows how the youth are corrupted and who are their corruptors.</div><div class="sentence"> I fancy that he must be a wise man, and seeing that I am the reverse of a wise man, he has found me out, and is going to accuse me of corrupting his young friends.</div><div class="sentence"> And of this our mother the state is to be the judge.</div><div class="sentence"> Of all our political men he is the only one who seems to me to begin in the right way, with the cultivation of virtue in youth; like a good husbandman, he makes the young shoots his first care, and clears away us who are the destroyers of them.</div><div class="sentence"> This is only the first step; he will afterwards attend to the elder branches; and if he goes on as he has begun, he will be a very great public benefactor.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  I hope that he may; but I rather fear, Socrates, that the opposite will turn out to be the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> My opinion is that in attacking you he is simply aiming a blow at the foundation of the state.</div><div class="sentence"> But in what way does he say that you corrupt the young?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He brings a wonderful accusation against me, which at first hearing excites surprise:  he says that I am a poet or maker of gods, and that I invent new gods and deny the existence of old ones; this is the ground of his indictment.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  I understand, Socrates; he means to attack you about the familiar sign which occasionally, as you say, comes to you.</div><div class="sentence"> He thinks that you are a neologian, and he is going to have you up before the court for this.</div><div class="sentence"> He knows that such a charge is readily received by the world, as I myself know too well; for when I speak in the assembly about divine things, and foretell the future to them, they laugh at me and think me a madman.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet every word that I say is true.</div><div class="sentence"> But they are jealous of us all; and we must be brave and go at them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Their laughter, friend Euthyphro, is not a matter of much consequence.</div><div class="sentence"> For a man may be thought wise; but the Athenians, I suspect, do not much trouble themselves about him until he begins to impart his wisdom to others, and then for some reason or other, perhaps, as you say, from jealousy, they are angry.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  I am never likely to try their temper in this way.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I dare say not, for you are reserved in your behaviour, and seldom impart your wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> But I have a benevolent habit of pouring out myself to everybody, and would even pay for a listener, and I am afraid that the Athenians may think me too talkative.</div><div class="sentence"> Now if, as I was saying, they would only laugh at me, as you say that they laugh at you, the time might pass gaily enough in the court; but perhaps they may be in earnest, and then what the end will be you soothsayers only can predict.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  I dare say that the affair will end in nothing, Socrates, and that you will win your cause; and I think that I shall win my own.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And what is your suit, Euthyphro?</div><div class="sentence"> are you the pursuer or the defendant?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  I am the pursuer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Of whom?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  You will think me mad when I tell you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, has the fugitive wings?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Nay, he is not very volatile at his time of life.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Who is he?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  My father.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Your father!</div><div class="sentence"> my good man?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And of what is he accused?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Of murder, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  By the powers, Euthyphro!</div><div class="sentence"> how little does the common herd know of the nature of right and truth.</div><div class="sentence"> A man must be an extraordinary man, and have made great strides in wisdom, before he could have seen his way to bring such an action.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Indeed, Socrates, he must.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose that the man whom your father murdered was one of your relatives—clearly he was; for if he had been a stranger you would never have thought of prosecuting him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  I am amused, Socrates, at your making a distinction between one who is a relation and one who is not a relation; for surely the pollution is the same in either case, if you knowingly associate with the murderer when you ought to clear yourself and him by proceeding against him.</div><div class="sentence"> The real question is whether the murdered man has been justly slain.</div><div class="sentence"> If justly, then your duty is to let the matter alone; but if unjustly, then even if the murderer lives under the same roof with you and eats at the same table, proceed against him.</div><div class="sentence"> Now the man who is dead was a poor dependant of mine who worked for us as a field labourer on our farm in Naxos, and one day in a fit of drunken passion he got into a quarrel with one of our domestic servants and slew him.</div><div class="sentence"> My father bound him hand and foot and threw him into a ditch, and then sent to Athens to ask of a diviner what he should do with him.</div><div class="sentence"> Meanwhile he never attended to him and took no care about him, for he regarded him as a murderer; and thought that no great harm would be done even if he did die.</div><div class="sentence"> Now this was just what happened.</div><div class="sentence"> For such was the effect of cold and hunger and chains upon him, that before the messenger returned from the diviner, he was dead.</div><div class="sentence"> And my father and family are angry with me for taking the part of the murderer and prosecuting my father.</div><div class="sentence"> They say that he did not kill him, and that if he did, the dead man was but a murderer, and I ought not to take any notice, for that a son is impious who prosecutes a father.</div><div class="sentence"> Which shows, Socrates, how little they know what the gods think about piety and impiety.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Good heavens, Euthyphro!</div><div class="sentence"> and is your knowledge of religion and of things pious and impious so very exact, that, supposing the circumstances to be as you state them, you are not afraid lest you too may be doing an impious thing in bringing an action against your father?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  The best of Euthyphro, and that which distinguishes him, Socrates, from other men, is his exact knowledge of all such matters.</div><div class="sentence"> What should I be good for without it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Rare friend!</div><div class="sentence"> I think that I cannot do better than be your disciple.</div><div class="sentence"> Then before the trial with Meletus comes on I shall challenge him, and say that I have always had a great interest in religious questions, and now, as he charges me with rash imaginations and innovations in religion, I have become your disciple.</div><div class="sentence"> You, Meletus, as I shall say to him, acknowledge Euthyphro to be a great theologian, and sound in his opinions; and if you approve of him you ought to approve of me, and not have me into court; but if you disapprove, you should begin by indicting him who is my teacher, and who will be the ruin, not of the young, but of the old; that is to say, of myself whom he instructs, and of his old father whom he admonishes and chastises.</div><div class="sentence"> And if Meletus refuses to listen to me, but will go on, and will not shift the indictment from me to you, I cannot do better than repeat this challenge in the court.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, indeed, Socrates; and if he attempts to indict me I am mistaken if I do not find a flaw in him; the court shall have a great deal more to say to him than to me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And I, my dear friend, knowing this, am desirous of becoming your disciple.</div><div class="sentence"> For I observe that no one appears to notice you—not even this Meletus; but his sharp eyes have found me out at once, and he has indicted me for impiety.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore, I adjure you to tell me the nature of piety and impiety, which you said that you knew so well, and of murder, and of other offences against the gods.</div><div class="sentence"> What are they?</div><div class="sentence"> Is not piety in every action always the same?</div><div class="sentence"> and impiety, again—is it not always the opposite of piety, and also the same with itself, having, as impiety, one notion which includes whatever is impious?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">040</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And what is piety, and what is impiety?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Piety is doing as I am doing; that is to say, prosecuting any one who is guilty of murder, sacrilege, or of any similar crime—whether he be your father or mother, or whoever he may be—that makes no difference; and not to prosecute them is impiety.</div><div class="sentence"> And please to consider, Socrates, what a notable proof I will give you of the truth of my words, a proof which I have already given to others: —of the principle, I mean, that the impious, whoever he may be, ought not to go unpunished.</div><div class="sentence"> For do not men regard Zeus as the best and most righteous of the gods?—and yet they admit that he bound his father (Cronos) because he wickedly devoured his sons, and that he too had punished his own father (Uranus) for a similar reason, in a nameless manner.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet when I proceed against my father, they are angry with me.</div><div class="sentence"> So inconsistent are they in their way of talking when the gods are concerned, and when I am concerned.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  May not this be the reason, Euthyphro, why I am charged with impiety—that I cannot away with these stories about the gods?</div><div class="sentence"> and therefore I suppose that people think me wrong.</div><div class="sentence"> But, as you who are well informed about them approve of them, I cannot do better than assent to your superior wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> What else can I say, confessing as I do, that I know nothing about them?</div><div class="sentence"> Tell me, for the love of Zeus, whether you really believe that they are true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">043</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates; and things more wonderful still, of which the world is in ignorance.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">044</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do you really believe that the gods fought with one another, and had dire quarrels, battles, and the like, as the poets say, and as you may see represented in the works of great artists?</div><div class="sentence"> The temples are full of them; and notably the robe of Athene, which is carried up to the Acropolis at the great Panathenaea, is embroidered with them.</div><div class="sentence"> Are all these tales of the gods true, Euthyphro?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates; and, as I was saying, I can tell you, if you would like to hear them, many other things about the gods which would quite amaze you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">046</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I dare say; and you shall tell me them at some other time when I have leisure.</div><div class="sentence"> But just at present I would rather hear from you a more precise answer, which you have not as yet given, my friend, to the question, What is 'piety'?</div><div class="sentence"> When asked, you only replied, Doing as you do, charging your father with murder.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">047</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  And what I said was true, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">048</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  No doubt, Euthyphro; but you would admit that there are many other pious acts?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">049</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  There are.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">050</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Remember that I did not ask you to give me two or three examples of piety, but to explain the general idea which makes all pious things to be pious.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you not recollect that there was one idea which made the impious impious, and the pious pious?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  I remember.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Tell me what is the nature of this idea, and then I shall have a standard to which I may look, and by which I may measure actions, whether yours or those of any one else, and then I shall be able to say that such and such an action is pious, such another impious.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  I will tell you, if you like.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I should very much like.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Piety, then, is that which is dear to the gods, and impiety is that which is not dear to them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good, Euthyphro; you have now given me the sort of answer which I wanted.</div><div class="sentence"> But whether what you say is true or not I cannot as yet tell, although I make no doubt that you will prove the truth of your words.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Come, then, and let us examine what we are saying.</div><div class="sentence"> That thing or person which is dear to the gods is pious, and that thing or person which is hateful to the gods is impious, these two being the extreme opposites of one another.</div><div class="sentence"> Was not that said?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  It was.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And well said?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates, I thought so; it was certainly said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And further, Euthyphro, the gods were admitted to have enmities and hatreds and differences?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, that was also said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And what sort of difference creates enmity and anger?</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose for example that you and I, my good friend, differ about a number; do differences of this sort make us enemies and set us at variance with one another?</div><div class="sentence"> Do we not go at once to arithmetic, and put an end to them by a sum?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Or suppose that we differ about magnitudes, do we not quickly end the differences by measuring?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And we end a controversy about heavy and light by resorting to a weighing machine?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But what differences are there which cannot be thus decided, and which therefore make us angry and set us at enmity with one another?</div><div class="sentence"> I dare say the answer does not occur to you at the moment, and therefore I will suggest that these enmities arise when the matters of difference are the just and unjust, good and evil, honourable and dishonourable.</div><div class="sentence"> Are not these the points about which men differ, and about which when we are unable satisfactorily to decide our differences, you and I and all of us quarrel, when we do quarrel?</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Alcib.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates, the nature of the differences about which we quarrel is such as you describe.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the quarrels of the gods, noble Euthyphro, when they occur, are of a like nature?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly they are.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">074</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  They have differences of opinion, as you say, about good and evil, just and unjust, honourable and dishonourable:  there would have been no quarrels among them, if there had been no such differences—would there now?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  You are quite right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">076</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Does not every man love that which he deems noble and just and good, and hate the opposite of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">078</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But, as you say, people regard the same things, some as just and others as unjust,—about these they dispute; and so there arise wars and fightings among them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">079</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then the same things are hated by the gods and loved by the gods, and are both hateful and dear to them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">081</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">082</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And upon this view the same things, Euthyphro, will be pious and also impious?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">083</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  So I should suppose.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">084</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, my friend, I remark with surprise that you have not answered the question which I asked.</div><div class="sentence"> For I certainly did not ask you to tell me what action is both pious and impious:  but now it would seem that what is loved by the gods is also hated by them.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore, Euthyphro, in thus chastising your father you may very likely be doing what is agreeable to Zeus but disagreeable to Cronos or Uranus, and what is acceptable to Hephaestus but unacceptable to Here, and there may be other gods who have similar differences of opinion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">085</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  But I believe, Socrates, that all the gods would be agreed as to the propriety of punishing a murderer:  there would be no difference of opinion about that.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">086</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but speaking of men, Euthyphro, did you ever hear any one arguing that a murderer or any sort of evil-doer ought to be let off?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  I should rather say that these are the questions which they are always arguing, especially in courts of law:  they commit all sorts of crimes, and there is nothing which they will not do or say in their own defence.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">088</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But do they admit their guilt, Euthyphro, and yet say that they ought not to be punished?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  No; they do not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then there are some things which they do not venture to say and do:  for they do not venture to argue that the guilty are to be unpunished, but they deny their guilt, do they not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then they do not argue that the evil-doer should not be punished, but they argue about the fact of who the evil-doer is, and what he did and when?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">093</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the gods are in the same case, if as you assert they quarrel about just and unjust, and some of them say while others deny that injustice is done among them.</div><div class="sentence"> For surely neither God nor man will ever venture to say that the doer of injustice is not to be punished?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  That is true, Socrates, in the main.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But they join issue about the particulars—gods and men alike; and, if they dispute at all, they dispute about some act which is called in question, and which by some is affirmed to be just, by others to be unjust.</div><div class="sentence"> Is not that true?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">098</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well then, my dear friend Euthyphro, do tell me, for my better instruction and information, what proof have you that in the opinion of all the gods a servant who is guilty of murder, and is put in chains by the master of the dead man, and dies because he is put in chains before he who bound him can learn from the interpreters of the gods what he ought to do with him, dies unjustly; and that on behalf of such an one a son ought to proceed against his father and accuse him of murder.</div><div class="sentence"> How would you show that all the gods absolutely agree in approving of his act?</div><div class="sentence"> Prove to me that they do, and I will applaud your wisdom as long as I live.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  It will be a difficult task; but I could make the matter very clear indeed to you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">100</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I understand; you mean to say that I am not so quick of apprehension as the judges:  for to them you will be sure to prove that the act is unjust, and hateful to the gods.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes indeed, Socrates; at least if they will listen to me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But they will be sure to listen if they find that you are a good speaker.</div><div class="sentence"> There was a notion that came into my mind while you were speaking; I said to myself:  'Well, and what if Euthyphro does prove to me that all the gods regarded the death of the serf as unjust, how do I know anything more of the nature of piety and impiety?</div><div class="sentence"> for granting that this action may be hateful to the gods, still piety and impiety are not adequately defined by these distinctions, for that which is hateful to the gods has been shown to be also pleasing and dear to them.'</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore, Euthyphro, I do not ask you to prove this; I will suppose, if you like, that all the gods condemn and abominate such an action.</div><div class="sentence"> But I will amend the definition so far as to say that what all the gods hate is impious, and what they love pious or holy; and what some of them love and others hate is both or neither.</div><div class="sentence"> Shall this be our definition of piety and impiety?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">103</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Why not, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why not!</div><div class="sentence"> certainly, as far as I am concerned, Euthyphro, there is no reason why not.</div><div class="sentence"> But whether this admission will greatly assist you in the task of instructing me as you promised, is a matter for you to consider.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I should say that what all the gods love is pious and holy, and the opposite which they all hate, impious.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Ought we to enquire into the truth of this, Euthyphro, or simply to accept the mere statement on our own authority and that of others?</div><div class="sentence"> What do you say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  We should enquire; and I believe that the statement will stand the test of enquiry.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We shall know better, my good friend, in a little while.</div><div class="sentence"> The point which I should first wish to understand is whether the pious or holy is beloved by the gods because it is holy, or holy because it is beloved of the gods.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">109</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  I do not understand your meaning, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I will endeavour to explain:  we, speak of carrying and we speak of being carried, of leading and being led, seeing and being seen.</div><div class="sentence"> You know that in all such cases there is a difference, and you know also in what the difference lies?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">111</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  I think that I understand.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">112</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is not that which is beloved distinct from that which loves?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">113</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">114</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well; and now tell me, is that which is carried in this state of carrying because it is carried, or for some other reason?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">115</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  No; that is the reason.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">116</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the same is true of what is led and of what is seen?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">117</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">118</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And a thing is not seen because it is visible, but conversely, visible because it is seen; nor is a thing led because it is in the state of being led, or carried because it is in the state of being carried, but the converse of this.</div><div class="sentence"> And now I think, Euthyphro, that my meaning will be intelligible; and my meaning is, that any state of action or passion implies previous action or passion.</div><div class="sentence"> It does not become because it is becoming, but it is in a state of becoming because it becomes; neither does it suffer because it is in a state of suffering, but it is in a state of suffering because it suffers.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you not agree?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">119</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">120</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Is not that which is loved in some state either of becoming or suffering?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">121</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">122</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the same holds as in the previous instances; the state of being loved follows the act of being loved, and not the act the state.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">123</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">124</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And what do you say of piety, Euthyphro:  is not piety, according to your definition, loved by all the gods?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">125</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">126</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Because it is pious or holy, or for some other reason?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">127</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  No, that is the reason.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">128</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  It is loved because it is holy, not holy because it is loved?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">129</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">130</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And that which is dear to the gods is loved by them, and is in a state to be loved of them because it is loved of them?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">132</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then that which is dear to the gods, Euthyphro, is not holy, nor is that which is holy loved of God, as you affirm; but they are two different things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">133</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  How do you mean, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">134</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I mean to say that the holy has been acknowledged by us to be loved of God because it is holy, not to be holy because it is loved.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">135</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">136</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But that which is dear to the gods is dear to them because it is loved by them, not loved by them because it is dear to them.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">138</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But, friend Euthyphro, if that which is holy is the same with that which is dear to God, and is loved because it is holy, then that which is dear to God would have been loved as being dear to God; but if that which is dear to God is dear to him because loved by him, then that which is holy would have been holy because loved by him.</div><div class="sentence"> But now you see that the reverse is the case, and that they are quite different from one another.</div><div class="sentence"> For one (theophiles) is of a kind to be loved cause it is loved, and the other (osion) is loved because it is of a kind to be loved.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus you appear to me, Euthyphro, when I ask you what is the essence of holiness, to offer an attribute only, and not the essence—the attribute of being loved by all the gods.</div><div class="sentence"> But you still refuse to explain to me the nature of holiness.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore, if you please, I will ask you not to hide your treasure, but to tell me once more what holiness or piety really is, whether dear to the gods or not (for that is a matter about which we will not quarrel); and what is impiety?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">139</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  I really do not know, Socrates, how to express what I mean.</div><div class="sentence"> For somehow or other our arguments, on whatever ground we rest them, seem to turn round and walk away from us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">140</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Your words, Euthyphro, are like the handiwork of my ancestor Daedalus; and if I were the sayer or propounder of them, you might say that my arguments walk away and will not remain fixed where they are placed because I am a descendant of his.</div><div class="sentence"> But now, since these notions are your own, you must find some other gibe, for they certainly, as you yourself allow, show an inclination to be on the move.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">141</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Nay, Socrates, I shall still say that you are the Daedalus who sets arguments in motion; not I, certainly, but you make them move or go round, for they would never have stirred, as far as I am concerned.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">142</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then I must be a greater than Daedalus:  for whereas he only made his own inventions to move, I move those of other people as well.</div><div class="sentence"> And the beauty of it is, that I would rather not.</div><div class="sentence"> For I would give the wisdom of Daedalus, and the wealth of Tantalus, to be able to detain them and keep them fixed.</div><div class="sentence"> But enough of this.</div><div class="sentence"> As I perceive that you are lazy, I will myself endeavour to show you how you might instruct me in the nature of piety; and I hope that you will not grudge your labour.</div><div class="sentence"> Tell me, then—Is not that which is pious necessarily just?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">143</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">144</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is, then, all which is just pious?</div><div class="sentence"> or, is that which is pious all just, but that which is just, only in part and not all, pious?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">145</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  I do not understand you, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">146</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet I know that you are as much wiser than I am, as you are younger.</div><div class="sentence"> But, as I was saying, revered friend, the abundance of your wisdom makes you lazy.</div><div class="sentence"> Please to exert yourself, for there is no real difficulty in understanding me.</div><div class="sentence"> What I mean I may explain by an illustration of what I do not mean.</div><div class="sentence"> The poet (Stasinus) sings—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">147</span> <div class="sentence">  'Of Zeus, the author and creator of all these things, You will not tell: for where there is fear there is also reverence.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">148</span> <div class="sentence">  Now I disagree with this poet.</div><div class="sentence"> Shall I tell you in what respect?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">149</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">150</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I should not say that where there is fear there is also reverence; for I am sure that many persons fear poverty and disease, and the like evils, but I do not perceive that they reverence the objects of their fear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">151</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">152</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But where reverence is, there is fear; for he who has a feeling of reverence and shame about the commission of any action, fears and is afraid of an ill reputation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">153</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  No doubt.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">154</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then we are wrong in saying that where there is fear there is also reverence; and we should say, where there is reverence there is also fear.</div><div class="sentence"> But there is not always reverence where there is fear; for fear is a more extended notion, and reverence is a part of fear, just as the odd is a part of number, and number is a more extended notion than the odd.</div><div class="sentence"> I suppose that you follow me now?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">155</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Quite well.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">156</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That was the sort of question which I meant to raise when I asked whether the just is always the pious, or the pious always the just; and whether there may not be justice where there is not piety; for justice is the more extended notion of which piety is only a part.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you dissent?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">157</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  No, I think that you are quite right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">158</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, if piety is a part of justice, I suppose that we should enquire what part?</div><div class="sentence"> If you had pursued the enquiry in the previous cases; for instance, if you had asked me what is an even number, and what part of number the even is, I should have had no difficulty in replying, a number which represents a figure having two equal sides.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you not agree?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">159</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I quite agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">160</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In like manner, I want you to tell me what part of justice is piety or holiness, that I may be able to tell Meletus not to do me injustice, or indict me for impiety, as I am now adequately instructed by you in the nature of piety or holiness, and their opposites.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">161</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Piety or holiness, Socrates, appears to me to be that part of justice which attends to the gods, as there is the other part of justice which attends to men.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">162</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That is good, Euthyphro; yet still there is a little point about which I should like to have further information, What is the meaning of 'attention'?</div><div class="sentence"> For attention can hardly be used in the same sense when applied to the gods as when applied to other things.</div><div class="sentence"> For instance, horses are said to require attention, and not every person is able to attend to them, but only a person skilled in horsemanship.</div><div class="sentence"> Is it not so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">163</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">164</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I should suppose that the art of horsemanship is the art of attending to horses?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">165</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">166</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Nor is every one qualified to attend to dogs, but only the huntsman?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">167</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">168</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And I should also conceive that the art of the huntsman is the art of attending to dogs?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">169</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">170</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  As the art of the oxherd is the art of attending to oxen?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">171</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">172</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In like manner holiness or piety is the art of attending to the gods?—that would be your meaning, Euthyphro?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">173</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">174</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is not attention always designed for the good or benefit of that to which the attention is given?</div><div class="sentence"> As in the case of horses, you may observe that when attended to by the horseman's art they are benefited and improved, are they not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">175</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">176</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  As the dogs are benefited by the huntsman's art, and the oxen by the art of the oxherd, and all other things are tended or attended for their good and not for their hurt?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">177</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly, not for their hurt.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">178</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But for their good?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">179</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">180</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And does piety or holiness, which has been defined to be the art of attending to the gods, benefit or improve them?</div><div class="sentence"> Would you say that when you do a holy act you make any of the gods better?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">181</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  No, no; that was certainly not what I meant.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">182</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And I, Euthyphro, never supposed that you did.</div><div class="sentence"> I asked you the question about the nature of the attention, because I thought that you did not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">183</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  You do me justice, Socrates; that is not the sort of attention which I mean.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">184</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Good:  but I must still ask what is this attention to the gods which is called piety?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">185</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  It is such, Socrates, as servants show to their masters.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">186</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I understand—a sort of ministration to the gods.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">187</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">188</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Medicine is also a sort of ministration or service, having in view the attainment of some object—would you not say of health?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">189</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  I should.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">190</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Again, there is an art which ministers to the ship-builder with a view to the attainment of some result?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">191</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates, with a view to the building of a ship.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">192</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  As there is an art which ministers to the house-builder with a view to the building of a house?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">194</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now tell me, my good friend, about the art which ministers to the gods:  what work does that help to accomplish?</div><div class="sentence"> For you must surely know if, as you say, you are of all men living the one who is best instructed in religion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">195</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  And I speak the truth, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">196</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Tell me then, oh tell me—what is that fair work which the gods do by the help of our ministrations?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">197</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Many and fair, Socrates, are the works which they do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">198</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, my friend, and so are those of a general.</div><div class="sentence"> But the chief of them is easily told.</div><div class="sentence"> Would you not say that victory in war is the chief of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">199</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">200</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Many and fair, too, are the works of the husbandman, if I am not mistaken; but his chief work is the production of food from the earth?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">201</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">202</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And of the many and fair things done by the gods, which is the chief or principal one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">203</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  I have told you already, Socrates, that to learn all these things accurately will be very tiresome.</div><div class="sentence"> Let me simply say that piety or holiness is learning how to please the gods in word and deed, by prayers and sacrifices.</div><div class="sentence"> Such piety is the salvation of families and states, just as the impious, which is unpleasing to the gods, is their ruin and destruction.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">204</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I think that you could have answered in much fewer words the chief question which I asked, Euthyphro, if you had chosen.</div><div class="sentence"> But I see plainly that you are not disposed to instruct me—clearly not:  else why, when we reached the point, did you turn aside?</div><div class="sentence"> Had you only answered me I should have truly learned of you by this time the nature of piety.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, as the asker of a question is necessarily dependent on the answerer, whither he leads I must follow; and can only ask again, what is the pious, and what is piety?</div><div class="sentence"> Do you mean that they are a sort of science of praying and sacrificing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">205</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">206</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And sacrificing is giving to the gods, and prayer is asking of the gods?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">207</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">208</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Upon this view, then, piety is a science of asking and giving?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">209</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  You understand me capitally, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">210</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, my friend; the reason is that I am a votary of your science, and give my mind to it, and therefore nothing which you say will be thrown away upon me.</div><div class="sentence"> Please then to tell me, what is the nature of this service to the gods?</div><div class="sentence"> Do you mean that we prefer requests and give gifts to them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">211</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">212</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Is not the right way of asking to ask of them what we want?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">213</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">214</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the right way of giving is to give to them in return what they want of us.</div><div class="sentence"> There would be no meaning in an art which gives to any one that which he does not want.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">215</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Very true, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">216</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then piety, Euthyphro, is an art which gods and men have of doing business with one another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">217</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  That is an expression which you may use, if you like.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">218</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But I have no particular liking for anything but the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> I wish, however, that you would tell me what benefit accrues to the gods from our gifts.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no doubt about what they give to us; for there is no good thing which they do not give; but how we can give any good thing to them in return is far from being equally clear.</div><div class="sentence"> If they give everything and we give nothing, that must be an affair of business in which we have very greatly the advantage of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">219</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  And do you imagine, Socrates, that any benefit accrues to the gods from our gifts?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">220</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if not, Euthyphro, what is the meaning of gifts which are conferred by us upon the gods?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">221</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  What else, but tributes of honour; and, as I was just now saying, what pleases them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">222</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Piety, then, is pleasing to the gods, but not beneficial or dear to them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">223</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  I should say that nothing could be dearer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">224</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then once more the assertion is repeated that piety is dear to the gods?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">225</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">226</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And when you say this, can you wonder at your words not standing firm, but walking away?</div><div class="sentence"> Will you accuse me of being the Daedalus who makes them walk away, not perceiving that there is another and far greater artist than Daedalus who makes them go round in a circle, and he is yourself; for the argument, as you will perceive, comes round to the same point.</div><div class="sentence"> Were we not saying that the holy or pious was not the same with that which is loved of the gods?</div><div class="sentence"> Have you forgotten?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">227</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  I quite remember.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">228</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And are you not saying that what is loved of the gods is holy; and is not this the same as what is dear to them—do you see?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">229</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">230</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then either we were wrong in our former assertion; or, if we were right then, we are wrong now.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">231</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  One of the two must be true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">232</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then we must begin again and ask, What is piety?</div><div class="sentence"> That is an enquiry which I shall never be weary of pursuing as far as in me lies; and I entreat you not to scorn me, but to apply your mind to the utmost, and tell me the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> For, if any man knows, you are he; and therefore I must detain you, like Proteus, until you tell.</div><div class="sentence"> If you had not certainly known the nature of piety and impiety, I am confident that you would never, on behalf of a serf, have charged your aged father with murder.</div><div class="sentence"> You would not have run such a risk of doing wrong in the sight of the gods, and you would have had too much respect for the opinions of men.</div><div class="sentence"> I am sure, therefore, that you know the nature of piety and impiety.</div><div class="sentence"> Speak out then, my dear Euthyphro, and do not hide your knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">233</span><div class="speaker">EUTHYPHRO</div><div class="sentence">  Another time, Socrates; for I am in a hurry, and must go now.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">234</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Alas!</div><div class="sentence"> my companion, and will you leave me in despair?</div><div class="sentence"> I was hoping that you would instruct me in the nature of piety and impiety; and then I might have cleared myself of Meletus and his indictment.</div><div class="sentence"> I would have told him that I had been enlightened by Euthyphro, and had given up rash innovations and speculations, in which I indulged only through ignorance, and that now I am about to lead a better life.</div></div>
