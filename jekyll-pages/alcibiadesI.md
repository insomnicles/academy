<h2>APPENDIX I.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  It seems impossible to separate by any exact line the genuine writings of Plato from the spurious.</div><div class="sentence"> The only external evidence to them which is of much value is that of Aristotle; for the Alexandrian catalogues of a century later include manifest forgeries.</div><div class="sentence"> Even the value of the Aristotelian authority is a good deal impaired by the uncertainty concerning the date and authorship of the writings which are ascribed to him.</div><div class="sentence"> And several of the citations of Aristotle omit the name of Plato, and some of them omit the name of the dialogue from which they are taken.</div><div class="sentence"> Prior, however, to the enquiry about the writings of a particular author, general considerations which equally affect all evidence to the genuineness of ancient writings are the following: Shorter works are more likely to have been forged, or to have received an erroneous designation, than longer ones; and some kinds of composition, such as epistles or panegyrical orations, are more liable to suspicion than others; those, again, which have a taste of sophistry in them, or the ring of a later age, or the slighter character of a rhetorical exercise, or in which a motive or some affinity to spurious writings can be detected, or which seem to have originated in a name or statement really occurring in some classical author, are also of doubtful credit; while there is no instance of any ancient writing proved to be a forgery, which combines excellence with length.</div><div class="sentence"> A really great and original writer would have no object in fathering his works on Plato; and to the forger or imitator, the 'literary hack' of Alexandria and Athens, the Gods did not grant originality or genius.</div><div class="sentence"> Further, in attempting to balance the evidence for and against a Platonic dialogue, we must not forget that the form of the Platonic writing was common to several of his contemporaries.</div><div class="sentence"> Aeschines, Euclid, Phaedo, Antisthenes, and in the next generation Aristotle, are all said to have composed dialogues; and mistakes of names are very likely to have occurred.</div><div class="sentence"> Greek literature in the third century before Christ was almost as voluminous as our own, and without the safeguards of regular publication, or printing, or binding, or even of distinct titles.</div><div class="sentence"> An unknown writing was naturally attributed to a known writer whose works bore the same character; and the name once appended easily obtained authority.</div><div class="sentence"> A tendency may also be observed to blend the works and opinions of the master with those of his scholars.</div><div class="sentence"> To a later Platonist, the difference between Plato and his imitators was not so perceptible as to ourselves.</div><div class="sentence"> The Memorabilia of Xenophon and the Dialogues of Plato are but a part of a considerable Socratic literature which has passed away.</div><div class="sentence"> And we must consider how we should regard the question of the genuineness of a particular writing, if this lost literature had been preserved to us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  These considerations lead us to adopt the following criteria of genuineness: (1) That is most certainly Plato's which Aristotle attributes to him by name, which (2) is of considerable length, of (3) great excellence, and also (4) in harmony with the general spirit of the Platonic writings.</div><div class="sentence"> But the testimony of Aristotle cannot always be distinguished from that of a later age (see above); and has various degrees of importance.</div><div class="sentence"> Those writings which he cites without mentioning Plato, under their own names, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> the Hippias, the Funeral Oration, the Phaedo, etc., have an inferior degree of evidence in their favour.</div><div class="sentence"> They may have been supposed by him to be the writings of another, although in the case of really great works, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> the Phaedo, this is not credible; those again which are quoted but not named, are still more defective in their external credentials.</div><div class="sentence"> There may be also a possibility that Aristotle was mistaken, or may have confused the master and his scholars in the case of a short writing; but this is inconceivable about a more important work, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> the Laws, especially when we remember that he was living at Athens, and a frequenter of the groves of the Academy, during the last twenty years of Plato's life.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor must we forget that in all his numerous citations from the Platonic writings he never attributes any passage found in the extant dialogues to any one but Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> And lastly, we may remark that one or two great writings, such as the Parmenides and the Politicus, which are wholly devoid of Aristotelian (1) credentials may be fairly attributed to Plato, on the ground of (2) length, (3) excellence, and (4) accordance with the general spirit of his writings.</div><div class="sentence"> Indeed the greater part of the evidence for the genuineness of ancient Greek authors may be summed up under two heads only: (1) excellence; and (2) uniformity of tradition—a kind of evidence, which though in many cases sufficient, is of inferior value.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Proceeding upon these principles we appear to arrive at the conclusion that nineteen-twentieths of all the writings which have ever been ascribed to Plato, are undoubtedly genuine.</div><div class="sentence"> There is another portion of them, including the Epistles, the Epinomis, the dialogues rejected by the ancients themselves, namely, the Axiochus, De justo, De virtute, Demodocus, Sisyphus, Eryxias, which on grounds, both of internal and external evidence, we are able with equal certainty to reject.</div><div class="sentence"> But there still remains a small portion of which we are unable to affirm either that they are genuine or spurious.</div><div class="sentence"> They may have been written in youth, or possibly like the works of some painters, may be partly or wholly the compositions of pupils; or they may have been the writings of some contemporary transferred by accident to the more celebrated name of Plato, or of some Platonist in the next generation who aspired to imitate his master.</div><div class="sentence"> Not that on grounds either of language or philosophy we should lightly reject them.</div><div class="sentence"> Some difference of style, or inferiority of execution, or inconsistency of thought, can hardly be considered decisive of their spurious character.</div><div class="sentence"> For who always does justice to himself, or who writes with equal care at all times?</div><div class="sentence"> Certainly not Plato, who exhibits the greatest differences in dramatic power, in the formation of sentences, and in the use of words, if his earlier writings are compared with his later ones, say the Protagoras or Phaedrus with the Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> Or who can be expected to think in the same manner during a period of authorship extending over above fifty years, in an age of great intellectual activity, as well as of political and literary transition?</div><div class="sentence"> Certainly not Plato, whose earlier writings are separated from his later ones by as wide an interval of philosophical speculation as that which separates his later writings from Aristotle.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  The dialogues which have been translated in the first Appendix, and which appear to have the next claim to genuineness among the Platonic writings, are the Lesser Hippias, the Menexenus or Funeral Oration, the First Alcibiades.</div><div class="sentence"> Of these, the Lesser Hippias and the Funeral Oration are cited by Aristotle; the first in the Metaphysics, the latter in the Rhetoric.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither of them are expressly attributed to Plato, but in his citation of both of them he seems to be referring to passages in the extant dialogues.</div><div class="sentence"> From the mention of 'Hippias' in the singular by Aristotle, we may perhaps infer that he was unacquainted with a second dialogue bearing the same name.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover, the mere existence of a Greater and Lesser Hippias, and of a First and Second Alcibiades, does to a certain extent throw a doubt upon both of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Though a very clever and ingenious work, the Lesser Hippias does not appear to contain anything beyond the power of an imitator, who was also a careful student of the earlier Platonic writings, to invent.</div><div class="sentence"> The motive or leading thought of the dialogue may be detected in Xen.</div><div class="sentence"> Mem., and there is no similar instance of a 'motive' which is taken from Xenophon in an undoubted dialogue of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, the upholders of the genuineness of the dialogue will find in the Hippias a true Socratic spirit; they will compare the Ion as being akin both in subject and treatment; they will urge the authority of Aristotle; and they will detect in the treatment of the Sophist, in the satirical reasoning upon Homer, in the reductio ad absurdum of the doctrine that vice is ignorance, traces of a Platonic authorship.</div><div class="sentence"> In reference to the last point we are doubtful, as in some of the other dialogues, whether the author is asserting or overthrowing the paradox of Socrates, or merely following the argument 'whither the wind blows.'</div><div class="sentence"> That no conclusion is arrived at is also in accordance with the character of the earlier dialogues.</div><div class="sentence"> The resemblances or imitations of the Gorgias, Protagoras, and Euthydemus, which have been observed in the Hippias, cannot with certainty be adduced on either side of the argument.</div><div class="sentence"> On the whole, more may be said in favour of the genuineness of the Hippias than against it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  The Menexenus or Funeral Oration is cited by Aristotle, and is interesting as supplying an example of the manner in which the orators praised 'the Athenians among the Athenians,' falsifying persons and dates, and casting a veil over the gloomier events of Athenian history.</div><div class="sentence"> It exhibits an acquaintance with the funeral oration of Thucydides, and was, perhaps, intended to rival that great work.</div><div class="sentence"> If genuine, the proper place of the Menexenus would be at the end of the Phaedrus.</div><div class="sentence"> The satirical opening and the concluding words bear a great resemblance to the earlier dialogues; the oration itself is professedly a mimetic work, like the speeches in the Phaedrus, and cannot therefore be tested by a comparison of the other writings of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> The funeral oration of Pericles is expressly mentioned in the Phaedrus, and this may have suggested the subject, in the same manner that the Cleitophon appears to be suggested by the slight mention of Cleitophon and his attachment to Thrasymachus in the Republic; and the Theages by the mention of Theages in the Apology and Republic; or as the Second Alcibiades seems to be founded upon the text of Xenophon, Mem.</div><div class="sentence"> A similar taste for parody appears not only in the Phaedrus, but in the Protagoras, in the Symposium, and to a certain extent in the Parmenides.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  To these two doubtful writings of Plato I have added the First Alcibiades, which, of all the disputed dialogues of Plato, has the greatest merit, and is somewhat longer than any of them, though not verified by the testimony of Aristotle, and in many respects at variance with the Symposium in the description of the relations of Socrates and Alcibiades.</div><div class="sentence"> Like the Lesser Hippias and the Menexenus, it is to be compared to the earlier writings of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> The motive of the piece may, perhaps, be found in that passage of the Symposium in which Alcibiades describes himself as self-convicted by the words of Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> For the disparaging manner in which Schleiermacher has spoken of this dialogue there seems to be no sufficient foundation.</div><div class="sentence"> At the same time, the lesson imparted is simple, and the irony more transparent than in the undoubted dialogues of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> We know, too, that Alcibiades was a favourite thesis, and that at least five or six dialogues bearing this name passed current in antiquity, and are attributed to contemporaries of Socrates and Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> (1) In the entire absence of real external evidence (for the catalogues of the Alexandrian librarians cannot be regarded as trustworthy); and (2) in the absence of the highest marks either of poetical or philosophical excellence; and (3) considering that we have express testimony to the existence of contemporary writings bearing the name of Alcibiades, we are compelled to suspend our judgment on the genuineness of the extant dialogue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  Neither at this point, nor at any other, do we propose to draw an absolute line of demarcation between genuine and spurious writings of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> They fade off imperceptibly from one class to another.</div><div class="sentence"> There may have been degrees of genuineness in the dialogues themselves, as there are certainly degrees of evidence by which they are supported.</div><div class="sentence"> The traditions of the oral discourses both of Socrates and Plato may have formed the basis of semi-Platonic writings; some of them may be of the same mixed character which is apparent in Aristotle and Hippocrates, although the form of them is different.</div><div class="sentence"> But the writings of Plato, unlike the writings of Aristotle, seem never to have been confused with the writings of his disciples: this was probably due to their definite form, and to their inimitable excellence.</div><div class="sentence"> The three dialogues which we have offered in the Appendix to the criticism of the reader may be partly spurious and partly genuine; they may be altogether spurious;—that is an alternative which must be frankly admitted.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor can we maintain of some other dialogues, such as the Parmenides, and the Sophist, and Politicus, that no considerable objection can be urged against them, though greatly overbalanced by the weight (chiefly) of internal evidence in their favour.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor, on the other hand, can we exclude a bare possibility that some dialogues which are usually rejected, such as the Greater Hippias and the Cleitophon, may be genuine.</div><div class="sentence"> The nature and object of these semi-Platonic writings require more careful study and more comparison of them with one another, and with forged writings in general, than they have yet received, before we can finally decide on their character.</div><div class="sentence"> We do not consider them all as genuine until they can be proved to be spurious, as is often maintained and still more often implied in this and similar discussions; but should say of some of them, that their genuineness is neither proven nor disproven until further evidence about them can be adduced.</div><div class="sentence"> And we are as confident that the Epistles are spurious, as that the Republic, the Timaeus, and the Laws are genuine.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  On the whole, not a twentieth part of the writings which pass under the name of Plato, if we exclude the works rejected by the ancients themselves and two or three other plausible inventions, can be fairly doubted by those who are willing to allow that a considerable change and growth may have taken place in his philosophy (see above).</div><div class="sentence"> That twentieth debatable portion scarcely in any degree affects our judgment of Plato, either as a thinker or a writer, and though suggesting some interesting questions to the scholar and critic, is of little importance to the general reader.</div></div>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  The First Alcibiades is a conversation between Socrates and Alcibiades.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates is represented in the character which he attributes to himself in the Apology of a know-nothing who detects the conceit of knowledge in others.</div><div class="sentence"> The two have met already in the Protagoras and in the Symposium; in the latter dialogue, as in this, the relation between them is that of a lover and his beloved.</div><div class="sentence"> But the narrative of their loves is told differently in different places; for in the Symposium Alcibiades is depicted as the impassioned but rejected lover; here, as coldly receiving the advances of Socrates, who, for the best of purposes, lies in wait for the aspiring and ambitious youth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Alcibiades, who is described as a very young man, is about to enter on public life, having an inordinate opinion of himself, and an extravagant ambition.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates, 'who knows what is in man,' astonishes him by a revelation of his designs.</div><div class="sentence"> But has he the knowledge which is necessary for carrying them out?</div><div class="sentence"> He is going to persuade the Athenians—about what?</div><div class="sentence"> Not about any particular art, but about politics—when to fight and when to make peace.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, men should fight and make peace on just grounds, and therefore the question of justice and injustice must enter into peace and war; and he who advises the Athenians must know the difference between them.</div><div class="sentence"> Does Alcibiades know?</div><div class="sentence"> If he does, he must either have been taught by some master, or he must have discovered the nature of them himself.</div><div class="sentence"> If he has had a master, Socrates would like to be informed who he is, that he may go and learn of him also.</div><div class="sentence"> Alcibiades admits that he has never learned.</div><div class="sentence"> Then has he enquired for himself?</div><div class="sentence"> He may have, if he was ever aware of a time when he was ignorant.</div><div class="sentence"> But he never was ignorant; for when he played with other boys at dice, he charged them with cheating, and this implied a knowledge of just and unjust.</div><div class="sentence"> According to his own explanation, he had learned of the multitude.</div><div class="sentence"> Why, he asks, should he not learn of them the nature of justice, as he has learned the Greek language of them?</div><div class="sentence"> To this Socrates answers, that they can teach Greek, but they cannot teach justice; for they are agreed about the one, but they are not agreed about the other: and therefore Alcibiades, who has admitted that if he knows he must either have learned from a master or have discovered for himself the nature of justice, is convicted out of his own mouth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Alcibiades rejoins, that the Athenians debate not about what is just, but about what is expedient; and he asserts that the two principles of justice and expediency are opposed.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates, by a series of questions, compels him to admit that the just and the expedient coincide.</div><div class="sentence"> Alcibiades is thus reduced to the humiliating conclusion that he knows nothing of politics, even if, as he says, they are concerned with the expedient.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  However, he is no worse than other Athenian statesmen; and he will not need training, for others are as ignorant as he is.</div><div class="sentence"> He is reminded that he has to contend, not only with his own countrymen, but with their enemies—with the Spartan kings and with the great king of Persia; and he can only attain this higher aim of ambition by the assistance of Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> Not that Socrates himself professes to have attained the truth, but the questions which he asks bring others to a knowledge of themselves, and this is the first step in the practice of virtue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  The dialogue continues:—We wish to become as good as possible.</div><div class="sentence"> But to be good in what?</div><div class="sentence"> Alcibiades replies—'Good in transacting business.'</div><div class="sentence"> But what business?</div><div class="sentence"> 'The business of the most intelligent men at Athens.'</div><div class="sentence"> The cobbler is intelligent in shoemaking, and is therefore good in that; he is not intelligent, and therefore not good, in weaving.</div><div class="sentence"> Is he good in the sense which Alcibiades means, who is also bad?</div><div class="sentence"> 'I mean,' replies Alcibiades, 'the man who is able to command in the city.'</div><div class="sentence"> But to command what—horses or men?</div><div class="sentence"> and if men, under what circumstances?</div><div class="sentence"> 'I mean to say, that he is able to command men living in social and political relations.'</div><div class="sentence"> And what is their aim?</div><div class="sentence"> 'The better preservation of the city.'</div><div class="sentence"> But when is a city better?</div><div class="sentence"> 'When there is unanimity, such as exists between husband and wife.'</div><div class="sentence"> Then, when husbands and wives perform their own special duties, there can be no unanimity between them; nor can a city be well ordered when each citizen does his own work only.</div><div class="sentence"> Alcibiades, having stated first that goodness consists in the unanimity of the citizens, and then in each of them doing his own separate work, is brought to the required point of self-contradiction, leading him to confess his own ignorance.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  But he is not too old to learn, and may still arrive at the truth, if he is willing to be cross-examined by Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> He must know himself; that is to say, not his body, or the things of the body, but his mind, or truer self.</div><div class="sentence"> The physician knows the body, and the tradesman knows his own business, but they do not necessarily know themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> Self-knowledge can be obtained only by looking into the mind and virtue of the soul, which is the diviner part of a man, as we see our own image in another's eye.</div><div class="sentence"> And if we do not know ourselves, we cannot know what belongs to ourselves or belongs to others, and are unfit to take a part in political affairs.</div><div class="sentence"> Both for the sake of the individual and of the state, we ought to aim at justice and temperance, not at wealth or power.</div><div class="sentence"> The evil and unjust should have no power,—they should be the slaves of better men than themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> None but the virtuous are deserving of freedom.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  And are you, Alcibiades, a freeman?</div><div class="sentence"> 'I feel that I am not; but I hope, Socrates, that by your aid I may become free, and from this day forward I will never leave you.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  The Alcibiades has several points of resemblance to the undoubted dialogues of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> The process of interrogation is of the same kind with that which Socrates practises upon the youthful Cleinias in the Euthydemus; and he characteristically attributes to Alcibiades the answers which he has elicited from him.</div><div class="sentence"> The definition of good is narrowed by successive questions, and virtue is shown to be identical with knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> Here, as elsewhere, Socrates awakens the consciousness not of sin but of ignorance.</div><div class="sentence"> Self-humiliation is the first step to knowledge, even of the commonest things.</div><div class="sentence"> No man knows how ignorant he is, and no man can arrive at virtue and wisdom who has not once in his life, at least, been convicted of error.</div><div class="sentence"> The process by which the soul is elevated is not unlike that which religious writers describe under the name of 'conversion,' if we substitute the sense of ignorance for the consciousness of sin.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span> <div class="sentence">  In some respects the dialogue differs from any other Platonic composition.</div><div class="sentence"> The aim is more directly ethical and hortatory; the process by which the antagonist is undermined is simpler than in other Platonic writings, and the conclusion more decided.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a good deal of humour in the manner in which the pride of Alcibiades, and of the Greeks generally, is supposed to be taken down by the Spartan and Persian queens; and the dialogue has considerable dialectical merit.</div><div class="sentence"> But we have a difficulty in supposing that the same writer, who has given so profound and complex a notion of the characters both of Alcibiades and Socrates in the Symposium, should have treated them in so thin and superficial a manner in the Alcibiades, or that he would have ascribed to the ironical Socrates the rather unmeaning boast that Alcibiades could not attain the objects of his ambition without his help; or that he should have imagined that a mighty nature like his could have been reformed by a few not very conclusive words of Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> For the arguments by which Alcibiades is reformed are not convincing; the writer of the dialogue, whoever he was, arrives at his idealism by crooked and tortuous paths, in which many pitfalls are concealed.</div><div class="sentence"> The anachronism of making Alcibiades about twenty years old during the life of his uncle, Pericles, may be noted; and the repetition of the favourite observation, which occurs also in the Laches and Protagoras, that great Athenian statesmen, like Pericles, failed in the education of their sons.</div><div class="sentence"> There is none of the undoubted dialogues of Plato in which there is so little dramatic verisimilitude.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I will proceed; and, although no lover likes to speak with one who has no feeling of love in him (compare Symp.</div><div class="sentence"> ), I will make an effort, and tell you what I meant:  My love, Alcibiades, which I hardly like to confess, would long ago have passed away, as I flatter myself, if I saw you loving your good things, or thinking that you ought to pass life in the enjoyment of them.</div><div class="sentence"> But I shall reveal other thoughts of yours, which you keep to yourself; whereby you will know that I have always had my eye on you.</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose that at this moment some God came to you and said:  Alcibiades, will you live as you are, or die in an instant if you are forbidden to make any further acquisition?—I verily believe that you would choose death.</div><div class="sentence"> And I will tell you the hope in which you are at present living:  Before many days have elapsed, you think that you will come before the Athenian assembly, and will prove to them that you are more worthy of honour than Pericles, or any other man that ever lived, and having proved this, you will have the greatest power in the state.</div><div class="sentence"> When you have gained the greatest power among us, you will go on to other Hellenic states, and not only to Hellenes, but to all the barbarians who inhabit the same continent with us.</div><div class="sentence"> And if the God were then to say to you again:  Here in Europe is to be your seat of empire, and you must not cross over into Asia or meddle with Asiatic affairs, I do not believe that you would choose to live upon these terms; but the world, as I may say, must be filled with your power and name—no man less than Cyrus and Xerxes is of any account with you.</div><div class="sentence"> Such I know to be your hopes—I am not guessing only—and very likely you, who know that I am speaking the truth, will reply, Well, Socrates, but what have my hopes to do with the explanation which you promised of your unwillingness to leave me?</div><div class="sentence"> And that is what I am now going to tell you, sweet son of Cleinias and Dinomache.</div><div class="sentence"> The explanation is, that all these designs of yours cannot be accomplished by you without my help; so great is the power which I believe myself to have over you and your concerns; and this I conceive to be the reason why the God has hitherto forbidden me to converse with you, and I have been long expecting his permission.</div><div class="sentence"> For, as you hope to prove your own great value to the state, and having proved it, to attain at once to absolute power, so do I indulge a hope that I shall be the supreme power over you, if I am able to prove my own great value to you, and to show you that neither guardian, nor kinsman, nor any one is able to deliver into your hands the power which you desire, but I only, God being my helper.</div><div class="sentence"> When you were young (compare Symp.)</div><div class="sentence"> and your hopes were not yet matured, I should have wasted my time, and therefore, as I conceive, the God forbade me to converse with you; but now, having his permission, I will speak, for now you will listen to me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Your silence, Socrates, was always a surprise to me.</div><div class="sentence"> I never could understand why you followed me about, and now that you have begun to speak again, I am still more amazed.</div><div class="sentence"> Whether I think all this or not, is a matter about which you seem to have already made up your mind, and therefore my denial will have no effect upon you.</div><div class="sentence"> But granting, if I must, that you have perfectly divined my purposes, why is your assistance necessary to the attainment of them?</div><div class="sentence"> Can you tell me why?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You want to know whether I can make a long speech, such as you are in the habit of hearing; but that is not my way.</div><div class="sentence"> I think, however, that I can prove to you the truth of what I am saying, if you will grant me one little favour.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, if the favour which you mean be not a troublesome one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Will you be troubled at having questions to answer?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then please to answer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Ask me.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I should reply, that I was going to advise them about a matter which I do know better than they.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then you are a good adviser about the things which you know?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And would you have been willing to learn or to examine what you supposed that you knew?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then there was a time when you thought that you did not know what you are now supposed to know?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I think that I know tolerably well the extent of your acquirements; and you must tell me if I forget any of them:  according to my recollection, you learned the arts of writing, of playing on the lyre, and of wrestling; the flute you never would learn; this is the sum of your accomplishments, unless there were some which you acquired in secret; and I think that secrecy was hardly possible, as you could not have come out of your door, either by day or night, without my seeing you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, that was the whole of my schooling.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And are you going to get up in the Athenian assembly, and give them advice about writing?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then what are the deliberations in which you propose to advise them?</div><div class="sentence"> Surely not about building?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Whether he be little or great, good or ill-looking, noble or ignoble—makes no difference.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">049</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Whether their counsellor is rich or poor, is not a matter which will make any difference to the Athenians when they are deliberating about the health of the citizens; they only require that he should be a physician.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then what will be the subject of deliberation about which you will be justified in getting up and advising them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  About their own concerns, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You mean about shipbuilding, for example, when the question is what sort of ships they ought to build?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  No, I should not advise them about that.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose, because you do not understand shipbuilding: —is that the reason?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  It is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then about what concerns of theirs will you advise them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  About war, Socrates, or about peace, or about any other concerns of the state.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You mean, when they deliberate with whom they ought to make peace, and with whom they ought to go to war, and in what manner?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And they ought to go to war with those against whom it is better to go to war?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And when it is better?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And for as long a time as is better?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But suppose the Athenians to deliberate with whom they ought to close in wrestling, and whom they should grasp by the hand, would you, or the master of gymnastics, be a better adviser of them?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And can you tell me on what grounds the master of gymnastics would decide, with whom they ought or ought not to close, and when and how?</div><div class="sentence"> To take an instance:  Would he not say that they should wrestle with those against whom it is best to wrestle?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And as much as is best?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And at such times as are best?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Again; you sometimes accompany the lyre with the song and dance?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">076</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  When it is well to do so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">078</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">079</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And as much as is well?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Just so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">081</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And as you speak of an excellence or art of the best in wrestling, and of an excellence in playing the lyre, I wish you would tell me what this latter is;—the excellence of wrestling I call gymnastic, and I want to know what you call the other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">082</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I do not understand you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">083</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then try to do as I do; for the answer which I gave is universally right, and when I say right, I mean according to rule.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">084</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">085</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And was not the art of which I spoke gymnastic?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">086</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And I called the excellence in wrestling gymnastic?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">088</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  You did.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And I was right?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I think that you were.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, now,—for you should learn to argue prettily—let me ask you in return to tell me, first, what is that art of which playing and singing, and stepping properly in the dance, are parts,—what is the name of the whole?</div><div class="sentence"> I think that by this time you must be able to tell.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Indeed I cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">093</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then let me put the matter in another way:  what do you call the Goddesses who are the patronesses of art?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  The Muses do you mean, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I do; and what is the name of the art which is called after them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose that you mean music.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, that is my meaning; and what is the excellence of the art of music, as I told you truly that the excellence of wrestling was gymnastic—what is the excellence of music—to be what?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">098</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  To be musical, I suppose.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good; and now please to tell me what is the excellence of war and peace; as the more musical was the more excellent, or the more gymnastical was the more excellent, tell me, what name do you give to the more excellent in war and peace?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">100</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  But I really cannot tell you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if you were offering advice to another and said to him—This food is better than that, at this time and in this quantity, and he said to you—What do you mean, Alcibiades, by the word 'better'?</div><div class="sentence"> you would have no difficulty in replying that you meant 'more wholesome,' although you do not profess to be a physician:  and when the subject is one of which you profess to have knowledge, and about which you are ready to get up and advise as if you knew, are you not ashamed, when you are asked, not to be able to answer the question?</div><div class="sentence"> Is it not disgraceful?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Very.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">103</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, consider and try to explain what is the meaning of 'better,' in the matter of making peace and going to war with those against whom you ought to go to war?</div><div class="sentence"> To what does the word refer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I am thinking, and I cannot tell.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But you surely know what are the charges which we bring against one another, when we arrive at the point of making war, and what name we give them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, certainly; we say that deceit or violence has been employed, or that we have been defrauded.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And how does this happen?</div><div class="sentence"> Will you tell me how?</div><div class="sentence"> For there may be a difference in the manner.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Do you mean by 'how,' Socrates, whether we suffered these things justly or unjustly?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  There can be no greater difference than between just and unjust.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">111</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And would you advise the Athenians to go to war with the just or with the unjust?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">112</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  That is an awkward question; for certainly, even if a person did intend to go to war with the just, he would not admit that they were just.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">113</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He would not go to war, because it would be unlawful?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">114</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Neither lawful nor honourable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">115</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then you, too, would address them on principles of justice?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">116</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">117</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What, then, is justice but that better, of which I spoke, in going to war or not going to war with those against whom we ought or ought not, and when we ought or ought not to go to war?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">119</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But how is this, friend Alcibiades?</div><div class="sentence"> Have you forgotten that you do not know this, or have you been to the schoolmaster without my knowledge, and has he taught you to discern the just from the unjust?</div><div class="sentence"> Who is he?</div><div class="sentence"> I wish you would tell me, that I may go and learn of him—you shall introduce me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">120</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  You are mocking, Socrates.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">122</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  But, perhaps, he does not exist; may I not have acquired the knowledge of just and unjust in some other way?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">127</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; if you thought that you did not know them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">128</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  And was there not a time when I did so think?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">129</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good; and can you tell me how long it is since you thought that you did not know the nature of the just and the unjust?</div><div class="sentence"> What do you say to a year ago?</div><div class="sentence"> Were you then in a state of conscious ignorance and enquiry?</div><div class="sentence"> Or did you think that you knew?</div><div class="sentence"> And please to answer truly, that our discussion may not be in vain.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">132</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I did.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">133</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And more than four years ago you were a child—were you not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">134</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">135</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And then I am quite sure that you thought you knew.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">136</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Why are you so sure?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">137</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Because I often heard you when a child, in your teacher's house, or elsewhere, playing at dice or some other game with the boys, not hesitating at all about the nature of the just and unjust; but very confident—crying and shouting that one of the boys was a rogue and a cheat, and had been cheating.</div><div class="sentence"> Is it not true?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">138</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  But what was I to do, Socrates, when anybody cheated me?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">139</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And how can you say, 'What was I to do'?</div><div class="sentence"> if at the time you did not know whether you were wronged or not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">140</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure I knew; I was quite aware that I was being cheated.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">141</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then you suppose yourself even when a child to have known the nature of just and unjust?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">142</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly; and I did know then.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">143</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And when did you discover them—not, surely, at the time when you thought that you knew them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">144</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">145</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And when did you think that you were ignorant—if you consider, you will find that there never was such a time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">146</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Really, Socrates, I cannot say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">147</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then you did not learn them by discovering them?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">149</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But just before you said that you did not know them by learning; now, if you have neither discovered nor learned them, how and whence do you come to know them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">150</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose that I was mistaken in saying that I knew them through my own discovery of them; whereas, in truth, I learned them in the same way that other people learn.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">151</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  So you said before, and I must again ask, of whom?</div><div class="sentence"> Do tell me.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">157</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And can they teach the better who are unable to teach the worse?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">158</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I think that they can; at any rate, they can teach many far better things than to play at draughts.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">159</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">160</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, for example, I learned to speak Greek of them, and I cannot say who was my teacher, or to whom I am to attribute my knowledge of Greek, if not to those good-for-nothing teachers, as you call them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">161</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, yes, my friend; and the many are good enough teachers of Greek, and some of their instructions in that line may be justly praised.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">162</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Why is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">163</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, because they have the qualities which good teachers ought to have.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">164</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  What qualities?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">165</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, you know that knowledge is the first qualification of any teacher?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">166</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">167</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if they know, they must agree together and not differ?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">171</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then how can they teach them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">172</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  They cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">173</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but do you imagine that the many would differ about the nature of wood and stone?</div><div class="sentence"> are they not agreed if you ask them what they are?</div><div class="sentence"> and do they not run to fetch the same thing, when they want a piece of wood or a stone?</div><div class="sentence"> And so in similar cases, which I suspect to be pretty nearly all that you mean by speaking Greek.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">174</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">175</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  These, as we were saying, are matters about which they are agreed with one another and with themselves; both individuals and states use the same words about them; they do not use some one word and some another.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">177</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then they may be expected to be good teachers of these things?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">183</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And you have a sufficient proof that they do not know these things and are not the best teachers of them, inasmuch as they are never agreed about them?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">185</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And suppose that we wanted to know not only what men are like, but what healthy or diseased men are like—would the many be able to teach us?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">187</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And you would have a proof that they were bad teachers of these matters, if you saw them at variance?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">189</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but are the many agreed with themselves, or with one another, about the justice or injustice of men and things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">190</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Assuredly not, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">191</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There is no subject about which they are more at variance?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">195</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But of the quarrels about justice and injustice, even if you have never seen them, you have certainly heard from many people, including Homer; for you have heard of the Iliad and Odyssey?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">225</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then who is speaking?</div><div class="sentence"> I who put the question, or you who answer me?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">229</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Now let us put the case generally:  whenever there is a question and answer, who is the speaker,—the questioner or the answerer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">230</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I should say, Socrates, that the answerer was the speaker.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">235</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Which of us, then, was the speaker?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">236</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  The inference is, Socrates, that I was the speaker.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">237</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Did not some one say that Alcibiades, the fair son of Cleinias, not understanding about just and unjust, but thinking that he did understand, was going to the assembly to advise the Athenians about what he did not know?</div><div class="sentence"> Was not that said?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">238</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">239</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, Alcibiades, the result may be expressed in the language of Euripides.</div><div class="sentence"> I think that you have heard all this 'from yourself, and not from me'; nor did I say this, which you erroneously attribute to me, but you yourself, and what you said was very true.</div><div class="sentence"> For indeed, my dear fellow, the design which you meditate of teaching what you do not know, and have not taken any pains to learn, is downright insanity.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">240</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  But, Socrates, I think that the Athenians and the rest of the Hellenes do not often advise as to the more just or unjust; for they see no difficulty in them, and therefore they leave them, and consider which course of action will be most expedient; for there is a difference between justice and expediency.</div><div class="sentence"> Many persons have done great wrong and profited by their injustice; others have done rightly and come to no good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">241</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but granting that the just and the expedient are ever so much opposed, you surely do not imagine that you know what is expedient for mankind, or why a thing is expedient?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">242</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Why not, Socrates?—But I am not going to be asked again from whom I learned, or when I made the discovery.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">243</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What a way you have!</div><div class="sentence"> When you make a mistake which might be refuted by a previous argument, you insist on having a new and different refutation; the old argument is a worn-our garment which you will no longer put on, but some one must produce another which is clean and new.</div><div class="sentence"> Now I shall disregard this move of yours, and shall ask over again,—Where did you learn and how do you know the nature of the expedient, and who is your teacher?</div><div class="sentence"> All this I comprehend in a single question, and now you will manifestly be in the old difficulty, and will not be able to show that you know the expedient, either because you learned or because you discovered it yourself.</div><div class="sentence"> But, as I perceive that you are dainty, and dislike the taste of a stale argument, I will enquire no further into your knowledge of what is expedient or what is not expedient for the Athenian people, and simply request you to say why you do not explain whether justice and expediency are the same or different?</div><div class="sentence"> And if you like you may examine me as I have examined you, or, if you would rather, you may carry on the discussion by yourself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">244</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  But I am not certain, Socrates, whether I shall be able to discuss the matter with you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">245</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then imagine, my dear fellow, that I am the demus and the ecclesia; for in the ecclesia, too, you will have to persuade men individually.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">252</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">253</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And cannot you persuade one man about that of which you can persuade many?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">254</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">255</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And that of which you can persuade either is clearly what you know?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">257</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the only difference between one who argues as we are doing, and the orator who is addressing an assembly, is that the one seeks to persuade a number, and the other an individual, of the same things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">258</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">259</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, since the same person who can persuade a multitude can persuade individuals, try conclusions upon me, and prove to me that the just is not always expedient.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">345</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, Alcibiades, the just is expedient?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">346</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I should infer so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">347</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And all this I prove out of your own mouth, for I ask and you answer?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">349</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And having acknowledged that the just is the same as the expedient, are you not (let me ask) prepared to ridicule any one who, pretending to understand the principles of justice and injustice, gets up to advise the noble Athenians or the ignoble Peparethians, that the just may be the evil?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">350</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I solemnly declare, Socrates, that I do not know what I am saying.</div><div class="sentence"> Verily, I am in a strange state, for when you put questions to me I am of different minds in successive instants.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">351</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And are you not aware of the nature of this perplexity, my friend?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">352</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Indeed I am not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">353</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do you suppose that if some one were to ask you whether you have two eyes or three, or two hands or four, or anything of that sort, you would then be of different minds in successive instants?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">354</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I begin to distrust myself, but still I do not suppose that I should.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">355</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You would feel no doubt; and for this reason—because you would know?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">356</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">357</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the reason why you involuntarily contradict yourself is clearly that you are ignorant?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">358</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Very likely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">359</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if you are perplexed in answering about just and unjust, honourable and dishonourable, good and evil, expedient and inexpedient, the reason is that you are ignorant of them, and therefore in perplexity.</div><div class="sentence"> Is not that clear?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">360</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">361</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But is this always the case, and is a man necessarily perplexed about that of which he has no knowledge?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">362</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly he is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">363</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do you know how to ascend into heaven?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">364</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">365</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And in this case, too, is your judgment perplexed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">366</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">367</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do you see the reason why, or shall I tell you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">368</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Tell me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">369</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The reason is, that you not only do not know, my friend, but you do not think that you know.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">370</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  There again; what do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">371</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Ask yourself; are you in any perplexity about things of which you are ignorant?</div><div class="sentence"> You know, for example, that you know nothing about the preparation of food.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">372</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">373</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do you think and perplex yourself about the preparation of food:  or do you leave that to some one who understands the art?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">374</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  The latter.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">375</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Or if you were on a voyage, would you bewilder yourself by considering whether the rudder is to be drawn inwards or outwards, or do you leave that to the pilot, and do nothing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">376</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  It would be the concern of the pilot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">377</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then you are not perplexed about what you do not know, if you know that you do not know it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">378</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I imagine not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">379</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do you not see, then, that mistakes in life and practice are likewise to be attributed to the ignorance which has conceit of knowledge?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">380</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Once more, what do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">381</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose that we begin to act when we think that we know what we are doing?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">383</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But when people think that they do not know, they entrust their business to others?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">385</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And so there is a class of ignorant persons who do not make mistakes in life, because they trust others about things of which they are ignorant?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">386</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">387</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Who, then, are the persons who make mistakes?</div><div class="sentence"> They cannot, of course, be those who know?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">388</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">389</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if neither those who know, nor those who know that they do not know, make mistakes, there remain those only who do not know and think that they know.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">390</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, only those.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">391</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then this is ignorance of the disgraceful sort which is mischievous?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">392</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">393</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And most mischievous and most disgraceful when having to do with the greatest matters?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">394</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  By far.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">395</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And can there be any matters greater than the just, the honourable, the good, and the expedient?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">396</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  There cannot be.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">397</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And these, as you were saying, are what perplex you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">398</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">399</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if you are perplexed, then, as the previous argument has shown, you are not only ignorant of the greatest matters, but being ignorant you fancy that you know them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">400</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I fear that you are right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">401</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now see what has happened to you, Alcibiades!</div><div class="sentence"> I hardly like to speak of your evil case, but as we are alone I will:  My good friend, you are wedded to ignorance of the most disgraceful kind, and of this you are convicted, not by me, but out of your own mouth and by your own argument; wherefore also you rush into politics before you are educated.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither is your case to be deemed singular.</div><div class="sentence"> For I might say the same of almost all our statesmen, with the exception, perhaps of your guardian, Pericles.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">402</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates; and Pericles is said not to have got his wisdom by the light of nature, but to have associated with several of the philosophers; with Pythocleides, for example, and with Anaxagoras, and now in advanced life with Damon, in the hope of gaining wisdom.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">403</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good; but did you ever know a man wise in anything who was unable to impart his particular wisdom?</div><div class="sentence"> For example, he who taught you letters was not only wise, but he made you and any others whom he liked wise.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">404</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">405</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And you, whom he taught, can do the same?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">408</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">409</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  When a person is enabled to impart knowledge to another, he thereby gives an excellent proof of his own understanding of any matter.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">410</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">411</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, and did Pericles make any one wise; did he begin by making his sons wise?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">412</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  But, Socrates, if the two sons of Pericles were simpletons, what has that to do with the matter?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">413</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but did he make your brother, Cleinias, wise?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">414</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Cleinias is a madman; there is no use in talking of him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">415</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if Cleinias is a madman and the two sons of Pericles were simpletons, what reason can be given why he neglects you, and lets you be as you are?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">417</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But did you ever hear of any other Athenian or foreigner, bond or free, who was deemed to have grown wiser in the society of Pericles,—as I might cite Pythodorus, the son of Isolochus, and Callias, the son of Calliades, who have grown wiser in the society of Zeno, for which privilege they have each of them paid him the sum of a hundred minae (about 406 pounds sterling) to the increase of their wisdom and fame.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">418</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I certainly never did hear of any one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">419</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, and in reference to your own case, do you mean to remain as you are, or will you take some pains about yourself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">420</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  With your aid, Socrates, I will.</div><div class="sentence"> And indeed, when I hear you speak, the truth of what you are saying strikes home to me, and I agree with you, for our statesmen, all but a few, do appear to be quite uneducated.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">421</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What is the inference?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">422</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, that if they were educated they would be trained athletes, and he who means to rival them ought to have knowledge and experience when he attacks them; but now, as they have become politicians without any special training, why should I have the trouble of learning and practising?</div><div class="sentence"> For I know well that by the light of nature I shall get the better of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">423</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  My dear friend, what a sentiment!</div><div class="sentence"> And how unworthy of your noble form and your high estate!</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">424</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean, Socrates; why do you say so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">425</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I am grieved when I think of our mutual love.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">426</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  At what?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">427</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  At your fancying that the contest on which you are entering is with people here.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">428</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, what others are there?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">429</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Is that a question which a magnanimous soul should ask?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">430</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Do you mean to say that the contest is not with these?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">431</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And suppose that you were going to steer a ship into action, would you only aim at being the best pilot on board?</div><div class="sentence"> Would you not, while acknowledging that you must possess this degree of excellence, rather look to your antagonists, and not, as you are now doing, to your fellow combatants?</div><div class="sentence"> You ought to be so far above these latter, that they will not even dare to be your rivals; and, being regarded by you as inferiors, will do battle for you against the enemy; this is the kind of superiority which you must establish over them, if you mean to accomplish any noble action really worthy of yourself and of the state.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">432</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  That would certainly be my aim.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">433</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Verily, then, you have good reason to be satisfied, if you are better than the soldiers; and you need not, when you are their superior and have your thoughts and actions fixed upon them, look away to the generals of the enemy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">434</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Of whom are you speaking, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">435</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, you surely know that our city goes to war now and then with the Lacedaemonians and with the great king?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">436</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  True enough.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">437</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if you meant to be the ruler of this city, would you not be right in considering that the Lacedaemonian and Persian king were your true rivals?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">438</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I believe that you are right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">439</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Oh no, my friend, I am quite wrong, and I think that you ought rather to turn your attention to Midias the quail-breeder and others like him, who manage our politics; in whom, as the women would remark, you may still see the slaves' cut of hair, cropping out in their minds as well as on their pates; and they come with their barbarous lingo to flatter us and not to rule us.</div><div class="sentence"> To these, I say, you should look, and then you need not trouble yourself about your own fitness to contend in such a noble arena:  there is no reason why you should either learn what has to be learned, or practise what has to be practised, and only when thoroughly prepared enter on a political career.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">440</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  There, I think, Socrates, that you are right; I do not suppose, however, that the Spartan generals or the great king are really different from anybody else.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">441</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But, my dear friend, do consider what you are saying.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">442</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  What am I to consider?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">443</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In the first place, will you be more likely to take care of yourself, if you are in a wholesome fear and dread of them, or if you are not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">444</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly, if I have such a fear of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">445</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do you think that you will sustain any injury if you take care of yourself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">446</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  No, I shall be greatly benefited.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">447</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And this is one very important respect in which that notion of yours is bad.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">448</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">449</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In the next place, consider that what you say is probably false.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">450</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">451</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let me ask you whether better natures are likely to be found in noble races or not in noble races?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">452</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly in noble races.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">453</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Are not those who are well born and well bred most likely to be perfect in virtue?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">454</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">455</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then let us compare our antecedents with those of the Lacedaemonian and Persian kings; are they inferior to us in descent?</div><div class="sentence"> Have we not heard that the former are sprung from Heracles, and the latter from Achaemenes, and that the race of Heracles and the race of Achaemenes go back to Perseus, son of Zeus?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">456</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, so does mine go back to Eurysaces, and he to Zeus!</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">457</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And mine, noble Alcibiades, to Daedalus, and he to Hephaestus, son of Zeus.</div><div class="sentence"> But, for all that, we are far inferior to them.</div><div class="sentence"> For they are descended 'from Zeus,' through a line of kings—either kings of Argos and Lacedaemon, or kings of Persia, a country which the descendants of Achaemenes have always possessed, besides being at various times sovereigns of Asia, as they now are; whereas, we and our fathers were but private persons.</div><div class="sentence"> How ridiculous would you be thought if you were to make a display of your ancestors and of Salamis the island of Eurysaces, or of Aegina, the habitation of the still more ancient Aeacus, before Artaxerxes, son of Xerxes.</div><div class="sentence"> You should consider how inferior we are to them both in the derivation of our birth and in other particulars.</div><div class="sentence"> Did you never observe how great is the property of the Spartan kings?</div><div class="sentence"> And their wives are under the guardianship of the Ephori, who are public officers and watch over them, in order to preserve as far as possible the purity of the Heracleid blood.</div><div class="sentence"> Still greater is the difference among the Persians; for no one entertains a suspicion that the father of a prince of Persia can be any one but the king.</div><div class="sentence"> Such is the awe which invests the person of the queen, that any other guard is needless.</div><div class="sentence"> And when the heir of the kingdom is born, all the subjects of the king feast; and the day of his birth is for ever afterwards kept as a holiday and time of sacrifice by all Asia; whereas, when you and I were born, Alcibiades, as the comic poet says, the neighbours hardly knew of the important event.</div><div class="sentence"> After the birth of the royal child, he is tended, not by a good-for-nothing woman-nurse, but by the best of the royal eunuchs, who are charged with the care of him, and especially with the fashioning and right formation of his limbs, in order that he may be as shapely as possible; which being their calling, they are held in great honour.</div><div class="sentence"> And when the young prince is seven years old he is put upon a horse and taken to the riding-masters, and begins to go out hunting.</div><div class="sentence"> And at fourteen years of age he is handed over to the royal schoolmasters, as they are termed:  these are four chosen men, reputed to be the best among the Persians of a certain age; and one of them is the wisest, another the justest, a third the most temperate, and a fourth the most valiant.</div><div class="sentence"> The first instructs him in the magianism of Zoroaster, the son of Oromasus, which is the worship of the Gods, and teaches him also the duties of his royal office; the second, who is the justest, teaches him always to speak the truth; the third, or most temperate, forbids him to allow any pleasure to be lord over him, that he may be accustomed to be a freeman and king indeed,—lord of himself first, and not a slave; the most valiant trains him to be bold and fearless, telling him that if he fears he is to deem himself a slave; whereas Pericles gave you, Alcibiades, for a tutor Zopyrus the Thracian, a slave of his who was past all other work.</div><div class="sentence"> I might enlarge on the nurture and education of your rivals, but that would be tedious; and what I have said is a sufficient sample of what remains to be said.</div><div class="sentence"> I have only to remark, by way of contrast, that no one cares about your birth or nurture or education, or, I may say, about that of any other Athenian, unless he has a lover who looks after him.</div><div class="sentence"> And if you cast an eye on the wealth, the luxury, the garments with their flowing trains, the anointings with myrrh, the multitudes of attendants, and all the other bravery of the Persians, you will be ashamed when you discern your own inferiority; or if you look at the temperance and orderliness and ease and grace and magnanimity and courage and endurance and love of toil and desire of glory and ambition of the Lacedaemonians—in all these respects you will see that you are but a child in comparison of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Even in the matter of wealth, if you value yourself upon that, I must reveal to you how you stand; for if you form an estimate of the wealth of the Lacedaemonians, you will see that our possessions fall far short of theirs.</div><div class="sentence"> For no one here can compete with them either in the extent and fertility of their own and the Messenian territory, or in the number of their slaves, and especially of the Helots, or of their horses, or of the animals which feed on the Messenian pastures.</div><div class="sentence"> But I have said enough of this:  and as to gold and silver, there is more of them in Lacedaemon than in all the rest of Hellas, for during many generations gold has been always flowing in to them from the whole Hellenic world, and often from the barbarian also, and never going out, as in the fable of Aesop the fox said to the lion, 'The prints of the feet of those going in are distinct enough;' but who ever saw the trace of money going out of Lacedaemon?</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore you may safely infer that the inhabitants are the richest of the Hellenes in gold and silver, and that their kings are the richest of them, for they have a larger share of these things, and they have also a tribute paid to them which is very considerable.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet the Spartan wealth, though great in comparison of the wealth of the other Hellenes, is as nothing in comparison of that of the Persians and their kings.</div><div class="sentence"> Why, I have been informed by a credible person who went up to the king (at Susa), that he passed through a large tract of excellent land, extending for nearly a day's journey, which the people of the country called the queen's girdle, and another, which they called her veil; and several other fair and fertile districts, which were reserved for the adornment of the queen, and are named after her several habiliments.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, I cannot help thinking to myself, What if some one were to go to Amestris, the wife of Xerxes and mother of Artaxerxes, and say to her, There is a certain Dinomache, whose whole wardrobe is not worth fifty minae—and that will be more than the value—and she has a son who is possessed of a three-hundred acre patch at Erchiae, and he has a mind to go to war with your son—would she not wonder to what this Alcibiades trusts for success in the conflict?</div><div class="sentence"> 'He must rely,' she would say to herself, 'upon his training and wisdom—these are the things which Hellenes value.'</div><div class="sentence"> And if she heard that this Alcibiades who is making the attempt is not as yet twenty years old, and is wholly uneducated, and when his lover tells him that he ought to get education and training first, and then go and fight the king, he refuses, and says that he is well enough as he is, would she not be amazed, and ask 'On what, then, does the youth rely?'</div><div class="sentence"> And if we replied:  He relies on his beauty, and stature, and birth, and mental endowments, she would think that we were mad, Alcibiades, when she compared the advantages which you possess with those of her own people.</div><div class="sentence"> And I believe that even Lampido, the daughter of Leotychides, the wife of Archidamus and mother of Agis, all of whom were kings, would have the same feeling; if, in your present uneducated state, you were to turn your thoughts against her son, she too would be equally astonished.</div><div class="sentence"> But how disgraceful, that we should not have as high a notion of what is required in us as our enemies' wives and mothers have of the qualities which are required in their assailants!</div><div class="sentence"> O my friend, be persuaded by me, and hear the Delphian inscription, 'Know thyself'—not the men whom you think, but these kings are our rivals, and we can only overcome them by pains and skill.</div><div class="sentence"> And if you fail in the required qualities, you will fail also in becoming renowned among Hellenes and Barbarians, which you seem to desire more than any other man ever desired anything.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">458</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  I entirely believe you; but what are the sort of pains which are required, Socrates,—can you tell me?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">459</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I can; but we must take counsel together concerning the manner in which both of us may be most improved.</div><div class="sentence"> For what I am telling you of the necessity of education applies to myself as well as to you; and there is only one point in which I have an advantage over you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">460</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  What is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">461</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I have a guardian who is better and wiser than your guardian, Pericles.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">462</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Who is he, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">463</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  God, Alcibiades, who up to this day has not allowed me to converse with you; and he inspires in me the faith that I am especially designed to bring you to honour.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">464</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  You are jesting, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">465</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Perhaps, at any rate, I am right in saying that all men greatly need pains and care, and you and I above all men.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">466</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  You are not far wrong about me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">467</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And certainly not about myself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">468</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  But what can we do?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">469</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There must be no hesitation or cowardice, my friend.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">470</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  That would not become us, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">471</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  No, indeed, and we ought to take counsel together:  for do we not wish to be as good as possible?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">472</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  We do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">473</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In what sort of virtue?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">474</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Plainly, in the virtue of good men.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">475</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Who are good in what?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">726</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  There is nothing.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">785</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Did you ever observe that the face of the person looking into the eye of another is reflected as in a mirror; and in the visual organ which is over against him, and which is called the pupil, there is a sort of image of the person looking?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">883</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">884</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  By your help, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">885</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That is not well said, Alcibiades.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">886</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  What ought I to have said?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">890</span><div class="speaker">ALCIBIADES</div><div class="sentence">  Strange, but true; and henceforward I shall begin to think about justice.</div></div>
