<h2>INTRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  The awe with which Plato regarded the character of 'the great' Parmenides has extended to the dialogue which he calls by his name.</div><div class="sentence"> None of the writings of Plato have been more copiously illustrated, both in ancient and modern times, and in none of them have the interpreters been more at variance with one another.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor is this surprising.</div><div class="sentence"> For the Parmenides is more fragmentary and isolated than any other dialogue, and the design of the writer is not expressly stated.</div><div class="sentence"> The date is uncertain; the relation to the other writings of Plato is also uncertain; the connexion between the two parts is at first sight extremely obscure; and in the latter of the two we are left in doubt as to whether Plato is speaking his own sentiments by the lips of Parmenides, and overthrowing him out of his own mouth, or whether he is propounding consequences which would have been admitted by Zeno and Parmenides themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> The contradictions which follow from the hypotheses of the one and many have been regarded by some as transcendental mysteries; by others as a mere illustration, taken at random, of a new method.</div><div class="sentence"> They seem to have been inspired by a sort of dialectical frenzy, such as may be supposed to have prevailed in the Megarian School (compare Cratylus, etc.).</div><div class="sentence"> The criticism on his own doctrine of Ideas has also been considered, not as a real criticism, but as an exuberance of the metaphysical imagination which enabled Plato to go beyond himself.</div><div class="sentence"> To the latter part of the dialogue we may certainly apply the words in which he himself describes the earlier philosophers in the Sophist: 'They went on their way rather regardless of whether we understood them or not.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  The Parmenides in point of style is one of the best of the Platonic writings; the first portion of the dialogue is in no way defective in ease and grace and dramatic interest; nor in the second part, where there was no room for such qualities, is there any want of clearness or precision.</div><div class="sentence"> The latter half is an exquisite mosaic, of which the small pieces are with the utmost fineness and regularity adapted to one another.</div><div class="sentence"> Like the Protagoras, Phaedo, and others, the whole is a narrated dialogue, combining with the mere recital of the words spoken, the observations of the reciter on the effect produced by them.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus we are informed by him that Zeno and Parmenides were not altogether pleased at the request of Socrates that they would examine into the nature of the one and many in the sphere of Ideas, although they received his suggestion with approving smiles.</div><div class="sentence"> And we are glad to be told that Parmenides was 'aged but well-favoured,' and that Zeno was 'very good-looking'; also that Parmenides affected to decline the great argument, on which, as Zeno knew from experience, he was not unwilling to enter.</div><div class="sentence"> The character of Antiphon, the half-brother of Plato, who had once been inclined to philosophy, but has now shown the hereditary disposition for horses, is very naturally described.</div><div class="sentence"> He is the sole depositary of the famous dialogue; but, although he receives the strangers like a courteous gentleman, he is impatient of the trouble of reciting it.</div><div class="sentence"> As they enter, he has been giving orders to a bridle-maker; by this slight touch Plato verifies the previous description of him.</div><div class="sentence"> After a little persuasion he is induced to favour the Clazomenians, who come from a distance, with a rehearsal.</div><div class="sentence"> Respecting the visit of Zeno and Parmenides to Athens, we may observe—first, that such a visit is consistent with dates, and may possibly have occurred; secondly, that Plato is very likely to have invented the meeting ('You, Socrates, can easily invent Egyptian tales or anything else,' Phaedrus); thirdly, that no reliance can be placed on the circumstance as determining the date of Parmenides and Zeno; fourthly, that the same occasion appears to be referred to by Plato in two other places (Theaet., Soph.</div><div class="sentence"> ).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Many interpreters have regarded the Parmenides as a 'reductio ad absurdum' of the Eleatic philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> But would Plato have been likely to place this in the mouth of the great Parmenides himself, who appeared to him, in Homeric language, to be 'venerable and awful,' and to have a 'glorious depth of mind'?</div><div class="sentence"> (Theaet.).</div><div class="sentence"> It may be admitted that he has ascribed to an Eleatic stranger in the Sophist opinions which went beyond the doctrines of the Eleatics.</div><div class="sentence"> But the Eleatic stranger expressly criticises the doctrines in which he had been brought up; he admits that he is going to 'lay hands on his father Parmenides.'</div><div class="sentence"> Nothing of this kind is said of Zeno and Parmenides.</div><div class="sentence"> How then, without a word of explanation, could Plato assign to them the refutation of their own tenets?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  The conclusion at which we must arrive is that the Parmenides is not a refutation of the Eleatic philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor would such an explanation afford any satisfactory connexion of the first and second parts of the dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> And it is quite inconsistent with Plato's own relation to the Eleatics.</div><div class="sentence"> For of all the pre-Socratic philosophers, he speaks of them with the greatest respect.</div><div class="sentence"> But he could hardly have passed upon them a more unmeaning slight than to ascribe to their great master tenets the reverse of those which he actually held.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  Two preliminary remarks may be made.</div><div class="sentence"> First, that whatever latitude we may allow to Plato in bringing together by a 'tour de force,' as in the Phaedrus, dissimilar themes, yet he always in some way seeks to find a connexion for them.</div><div class="sentence"> Many threads join together in one the love and dialectic of the Phaedrus.</div><div class="sentence"> We cannot conceive that the great artist would place in juxtaposition two absolutely divided and incoherent subjects.</div><div class="sentence"> And hence we are led to make a second remark: viz.</div><div class="sentence"> that no explanation of the Parmenides can be satisfactory which does not indicate the connexion of the first and second parts.</div><div class="sentence"> To suppose that Plato would first go out of his way to make Parmenides attack the Platonic Ideas, and then proceed to a similar but more fatal assault on his own doctrine of Being, appears to be the height of absurdity.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  Perhaps there is no passage in Plato showing greater metaphysical power than that in which he assails his own theory of Ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> The arguments are nearly, if not quite, those of Aristotle; they are the objections which naturally occur to a modern student of philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> Many persons will be surprised to find Plato criticizing the very conceptions which have been supposed in after ages to be peculiarly characteristic of him.</div><div class="sentence"> How can he have placed himself so completely without them?</div><div class="sentence"> How can he have ever persisted in them after seeing the fatal objections which might be urged against them?</div><div class="sentence"> The consideration of this difficulty has led a recent critic (Ueberweg), who in general accepts the authorised canon of the Platonic writings, to condemn the Parmenides as spurious.</div><div class="sentence"> The accidental want of external evidence, at first sight, seems to favour this opinion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  In answer, it might be sufficient to say, that no ancient writing of equal length and excellence is known to be spurious.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor is the silence of Aristotle to be hastily assumed; there is at least a doubt whether his use of the same arguments does not involve the inference that he knew the work.</div><div class="sentence"> And, if the Parmenides is spurious, like Ueberweg, we are led on further than we originally intended, to pass a similar condemnation on the Theaetetus and Sophist, and therefore on the Politicus (compare Theaet., Soph.).</div><div class="sentence"> But the objection is in reality fanciful, and rests on the assumption that the doctrine of the Ideas was held by Plato throughout his life in the same form.</div><div class="sentence"> For the truth is, that the Platonic Ideas were in constant process of growth and transmutation; sometimes veiled in poetry and mythology, then again emerging as fixed Ideas, in some passages regarded as absolute and eternal, and in others as relative to the human mind, existing in and derived from external objects as well as transcending them.</div><div class="sentence"> The anamnesis of the Ideas is chiefly insisted upon in the mythical portions of the dialogues, and really occupies a very small space in the entire works of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> Their transcendental existence is not asserted, and is therefore implicitly denied in the Philebus; different forms are ascribed to them in the Republic, and they are mentioned in the Theaetetus, the Sophist, the Politicus, and the Laws, much as Universals would be spoken of in modern books.</div><div class="sentence"> Indeed, there are very faint traces of the transcendental doctrine of Ideas, that is, of their existence apart from the mind, in any of Plato's writings, with the exception of the Meno, the Phaedrus, the Phaedo, and in portions of the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> The stereotyped form which Aristotle has given to them is not found in Plato (compare Essay on the Platonic Ideas in the Introduction to the Meno.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  The full discussion of this subject involves a comprehensive survey of the philosophy of Plato, which would be out of place here.</div><div class="sentence"> But, without digressing further from the immediate subject of the Parmenides, we may remark that Plato is quite serious in his objections to his own doctrines: nor does Socrates attempt to offer any answer to them.</div><div class="sentence"> The perplexities which surround the one and many in the sphere of the Ideas are also alluded to in the Philebus, and no answer is given to them.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor have they ever been answered, nor can they be answered by any one else who separates the phenomenal from the real.</div><div class="sentence"> To suppose that Plato, at a later period of his life, reached a point of view from which he was able to answer them, is a groundless assumption.</div><div class="sentence"> The real progress of Plato's own mind has been partly concealed from us by the dogmatic statements of Aristotle, and also by the degeneracy of his own followers, with whom a doctrine of numbers quickly superseded Ideas.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span> <div class="sentence">  As a preparation for answering some of the difficulties which have been suggested, we may begin by sketching the first portion of the dialogue:—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span> <div class="sentence">  Cephalus, of Clazomenae in Ionia, the birthplace of Anaxagoras, a citizen of no mean city in the history of philosophy, who is the narrator of the dialogue, describes himself as meeting Adeimantus and Glaucon in the Agora at Athens.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Welcome, Cephalus: can we do anything for you in Athens?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Why, yes: I came to ask a favour of you.</div><div class="sentence"> First, tell me your half-brother's name, which I have forgotten—he was a mere child when I was last here;—I know his father's, which is Pyrilampes.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Yes, and the name of our brother is Antiphon.</div><div class="sentence"> But why do you ask?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Let me introduce to you some countrymen of mine, who are lovers of philosophy; they have heard that Antiphon remembers a conversation of Socrates with Parmenides and Zeno, of which the report came to him from Pythodorus, Zeno's friend.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'That is quite true.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'And can they hear the dialogue?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Nothing easier; in the days of his youth he made a careful study of the piece; at present, his thoughts have another direction: he takes after his grandfather, and has given up philosophy for horses.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span> <div class="sentence">  'We went to look for him, and found him giving instructions to a worker in brass about a bridle.</div><div class="sentence"> When he had done with him, and had learned from his brothers the purpose of our visit, he saluted me as an old acquaintance, and we asked him to repeat the dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> At first, he complained of the trouble, but he soon consented.</div><div class="sentence"> He told us that Pythodorus had described to him the appearance of Parmenides and Zeno; they had come to Athens at the great Panathenaea, the former being at the time about sixty-five years old, aged but well-favoured—Zeno, who was said to have been beloved of Parmenides in the days of his youth, about forty, and very good-looking:—that they lodged with Pythodorus at the Ceramicus outside the wall, whither Socrates, then a very young man, came to see them: Zeno was reading one of his theses, which he had nearly finished, when Pythodorus entered with Parmenides and Aristoteles, who was afterwards one of the Thirty.</div><div class="sentence"> When the recitation was completed, Socrates requested that the first thesis of the treatise might be read again.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span> <div class="sentence">  'You mean, Zeno,' said Socrates, 'to argue that being, if it is many, must be both like and unlike, which is a contradiction; and each division of your argument is intended to elicit a similar absurdity, which may be supposed to follow from the assumption that being is many.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Such is my meaning.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'I see,' said Socrates, turning to Parmenides, 'that Zeno is your second self in his writings too; you prove admirably that the all is one: he gives proofs no less convincing that the many are nought.</div><div class="sentence"> To deceive the world by saying the same thing in entirely different forms, is a strain of art beyond most of us.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Yes, Socrates,' said Zeno; 'but though you are as keen as a Spartan hound, you do not quite catch the motive of the piece, which was only intended to protect Parmenides against ridicule by showing that the hypothesis of the existence of the many involved greater absurdities than the hypothesis of the one.</div><div class="sentence"> The book was a youthful composition of mine, which was stolen from me, and therefore I had no choice about the publication.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'I quite believe you,' said Socrates; 'but will you answer me a question?</div><div class="sentence"> I should like to know, whether you would assume an idea of likeness in the abstract, which is the contradictory of unlikeness in the abstract, by participation in either or both of which things are like or unlike or partly both.</div><div class="sentence"> For the same things may very well partake of like and unlike in the concrete, though like and unlike in the abstract are irreconcilable.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor does there appear to me to be any absurdity in maintaining that the same things may partake of the one and many, though I should be indeed surprised to hear that the absolute one is also many.</div><div class="sentence"> For example, I, being many, that is to say, having many parts or members, am yet also one, and partake of the one, being one of seven who are here present (compare Philebus).</div><div class="sentence"> This is not an absurdity, but a truism.</div><div class="sentence"> But I should be amazed if there were a similar entanglement in the nature of the ideas themselves, nor can I believe that one and many, like and unlike, rest and motion, in the abstract, are capable either of admixture or of separation.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span> <div class="sentence">  Pythodorus said that in his opinion Parmenides and Zeno were not very well pleased at the questions which were raised; nevertheless, they looked at one another and smiled in seeming delight and admiration of Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Tell me,' said Parmenides, 'do you think that the abstract ideas of likeness, unity, and the rest, exist apart from individuals which partake of them?</div><div class="sentence"> and is this your own distinction?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'I think that there are such ideas.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'And would you make abstract ideas of the just, the beautiful, the good?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Yes,' he said.</div><div class="sentence"> 'And of human beings like ourselves, of water, fire, and the like?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'I am not certain.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'And would you be undecided also about ideas of which the mention will, perhaps, appear laughable: of hair, mud, filth, and other things which are base and vile?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'No, Parmenides; visible things like these are, as I believe, only what they appear to be: though I am sometimes disposed to imagine that there is nothing without an idea; but I repress any such notion, from a fear of falling into an abyss of nonsense.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'You are young, Socrates, and therefore naturally regard the opinions of men; the time will come when philosophy will have a firmer hold of you, and you will not despise even the meanest things.</div><div class="sentence"> But tell me, is your meaning that things become like by partaking of likeness, great by partaking of greatness, just and beautiful by partaking of justice and beauty, and so of other ideas?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Yes, that is my meaning.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'And do you suppose the individual to partake of the whole, or of the part?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Why not of the whole?'</div><div class="sentence"> said Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Because,' said Parmenides, 'in that case the whole, which is one, will become many.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Nay,' said Socrates, 'the whole may be like the day, which is one and in many places: in this way the ideas may be one and also many.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'In the same sort of way,' said Parmenides, 'as a sail, which is one, may be a cover to many—that is your meaning?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Yes.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'And would you say that each man is covered by the whole sail, or by a part only?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'By a part.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Then the ideas have parts, and the objects partake of a part of them only?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'That seems to follow.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'And would you like to say that the ideas are really divisible and yet remain one?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Certainly not.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Would you venture to affirm that great objects have a portion only of greatness transferred to them; or that small or equal objects are small or equal because they are only portions of smallness or equality?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Impossible.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'But how can individuals participate in ideas, except in the ways which I have mentioned?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'That is not an easy question to answer.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'I should imagine the conception of ideas to arise as follows: you see great objects pervaded by a common form or idea of greatness, which you abstract.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'That is quite true.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'And supposing you embrace in one view the idea of greatness thus gained and the individuals which it comprises, a further idea of greatness arises, which makes both great; and this may go on to infinity.'</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates replies that the ideas may be thoughts in the mind only; in this case, the consequence would no longer follow.</div><div class="sentence"> 'But must not the thought be of something which is the same in all and is the idea?</div><div class="sentence"> And if the world partakes in the ideas, and the ideas are thoughts, must not all things think?</div><div class="sentence"> Or can thought be without thought?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'I acknowledge the unmeaningness of this,' says Socrates, 'and would rather have recourse to the explanation that the ideas are types in nature, and that other things partake of them by becoming like them.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'But to become like them is to be comprehended in the same idea; and the likeness of the idea and the individuals implies another idea of likeness, and another without end.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Quite true.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'The theory, then, of participation by likeness has to be given up.</div><div class="sentence"> You have hardly yet, Socrates, found out the real difficulty of maintaining abstract ideas.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'What difficulty?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'The greatest of all perhaps is this: an opponent will argue that the ideas are not within the range of human knowledge; and you cannot disprove the assertion without a long and laborious demonstration, which he may be unable or unwilling to follow.</div><div class="sentence"> In the first place, neither you nor any one who maintains the existence of absolute ideas will affirm that they are subjective.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'That would be a contradiction.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'True; and therefore any relation in these ideas is a relation which concerns themselves only; and the objects which are named after them, are relative to one another only, and have nothing to do with the ideas themselves.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'How do you mean?'</div><div class="sentence"> said Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> 'I may illustrate my meaning in this way: one of us has a slave; and the idea of a slave in the abstract is relative to the idea of a master in the abstract; this correspondence of ideas, however, has nothing to do with the particular relation of our slave to us.—Do you see my meaning?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Perfectly.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'And absolute knowledge in the same way corresponds to absolute truth and being, and particular knowledge to particular truth and being.'</div><div class="sentence"> Clearly.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'And there is a subjective knowledge which is of subjective truth, having many kinds, general and particular.</div><div class="sentence"> But the ideas themselves are not subjective, and therefore are not within our ken.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'They are not.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Then the beautiful and the good in their own nature are unknown to us?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'It would seem so.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'There is a worse consequence yet.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'What is that?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'I think we must admit that absolute knowledge is the most exact knowledge, which we must therefore attribute to God.</div><div class="sentence"> But then see what follows: God, having this exact knowledge, can have no knowledge of human things, as we have divided the two spheres, and forbidden any passing from one to the other:—the gods have knowledge and authority in their world only, as we have in ours.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Yet, surely, to deprive God of knowledge is monstrous.</div><div class="sentence"> '—'These are some of the difficulties which are involved in the assumption of absolute ideas; the learner will find them nearly impossible to understand, and the teacher who has to impart them will require superhuman ability; there will always be a suspicion, either that they have no existence, or are beyond human knowledge.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'There I agree with you,' said Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Yet if these difficulties induce you to give up universal ideas, what becomes of the mind?</div><div class="sentence"> and where are the reasoning and reflecting powers?</div><div class="sentence"> philosophy is at an end.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'I certainly do not see my way.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'I think,' said Parmenides, 'that this arises out of your attempting to define abstractions, such as the good and the beautiful and the just, before you have had sufficient previous training; I noticed your deficiency when you were talking with Aristoteles, the day before yesterday.</div><div class="sentence"> Your enthusiasm is a wonderful gift; but I fear that unless you discipline yourself by dialectic while you are young, truth will elude your grasp.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'And what kind of discipline would you recommend?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'The training which you heard Zeno practising; at the same time, I admire your saying to him that you did not care to consider the difficulty in reference to visible objects, but only in relation to ideas.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Yes; because I think that in visible objects you may easily show any number of inconsistent consequences.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Yes; and you should consider, not only the consequences which follow from a given hypothesis, but the consequences also which follow from the denial of the hypothesis.</div><div class="sentence"> For example, what follows from the assumption of the existence of the many, and the counter-argument of what follows from the denial of the existence of the many: and similarly of likeness and unlikeness, motion, rest, generation, corruption, being and not being.</div><div class="sentence"> And the consequences must include consequences to the things supposed and to other things, in themselves and in relation to one another, to individuals whom you select, to the many, and to the all; these must be drawn out both on the affirmative and on the negative hypothesis,—that is, if you are to train yourself perfectly to the intelligence of the truth.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'What you are suggesting seems to be a tremendous process, and one of which I do not quite understand the nature,' said Socrates; 'will you give me an example?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'You must not impose such a task on a man of my years,' said Parmenides.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Then will you, Zeno?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Let us rather,' said Zeno, with a smile, 'ask Parmenides, for the undertaking is a serious one, as he truly says; nor could I urge him to make the attempt, except in a select audience of persons who will understand him.'</div><div class="sentence"> The whole party joined in the request.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span> <div class="sentence">  Here we have, first of all, an unmistakable attack made by the youthful Socrates on the paradoxes of Zeno.</div><div class="sentence"> He perfectly understands their drift, and Zeno himself is supposed to admit this.</div><div class="sentence"> But they appear to him, as he says in the Philebus also, to be rather truisms than paradoxes.</div><div class="sentence"> For every one must acknowledge the obvious fact, that the body being one has many members, and that, in a thousand ways, the like partakes of the unlike, the many of the one.</div><div class="sentence"> The real difficulty begins with the relations of ideas in themselves, whether of the one and many, or of any other ideas, to one another and to the mind.</div><div class="sentence"> But this was a problem which the Eleatic philosophers had never considered; their thoughts had not gone beyond the contradictions of matter, motion, space, and the like.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span> <div class="sentence">  It was no wonder that Parmenides and Zeno should hear the novel speculations of Socrates with mixed feelings of admiration and displeasure.</div><div class="sentence"> He was going out of the received circle of disputation into a region in which they could hardly follow him.</div><div class="sentence"> From the crude idea of Being in the abstract, he was about to proceed to universals or general notions.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no contradiction in material things partaking of the ideas of one and many; neither is there any contradiction in the ideas of one and many, like and unlike, in themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> But the contradiction arises when we attempt to conceive ideas in their connexion, or to ascertain their relation to phenomena.</div><div class="sentence"> Still he affirms the existence of such ideas; and this is the position which is now in turn submitted to the criticisms of Parmenides.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span> <div class="sentence">  To appreciate truly the character of these criticisms, we must remember the place held by Parmenides in the history of Greek philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> He is the founder of idealism, and also of dialectic, or, in modern phraseology, of metaphysics and logic (Theaet., Soph.).</div><div class="sentence"> Like Plato, he is struggling after something wider and deeper than satisfied the contemporary Pythagoreans.</div><div class="sentence"> And Plato with a true instinct recognizes him as his spiritual father, whom he 'revered and honoured more than all other philosophers together.'</div><div class="sentence"> He may be supposed to have thought more than he said, or was able to express.</div><div class="sentence"> And, although he could not, as a matter of fact, have criticized the ideas of Plato without an anachronism, the criticism is appropriately placed in the mouth of the founder of the ideal philosophy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span> <div class="sentence">  There was probably a time in the life of Plato when the ethical teaching of Socrates came into conflict with the metaphysical theories of the earlier philosophers, and he sought to supplement the one by the other.</div><div class="sentence"> The older philosophers were great and awful; and they had the charm of antiquity.</div><div class="sentence"> Something which found a response in his own mind seemed to have been lost as well as gained in the Socratic dialectic.</div><div class="sentence"> He felt no incongruity in the veteran Parmenides correcting the youthful Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> Two points in his criticism are especially deserving of notice.</div><div class="sentence"> First of all, Parmenides tries him by the test of consistency.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates is willing to assume ideas or principles of the just, the beautiful, the good, and to extend them to man (compare Phaedo); but he is reluctant to admit that there are general ideas of hair, mud, filth, etc.</div><div class="sentence"> There is an ethical universal or idea, but is there also a universal of physics?—of the meanest things in the world as well as of the greatest?</div><div class="sentence"> Parmenides rebukes this want of consistency in Socrates, which he attributes to his youth.</div><div class="sentence"> As he grows older, philosophy will take a firmer hold of him, and then he will despise neither great things nor small, and he will think less of the opinions of mankind (compare Soph.).</div><div class="sentence"> Here is lightly touched one of the most familiar principles of modern philosophy, that in the meanest operations of nature, as well as in the noblest, in mud and filth, as well as in the sun and stars, great truths are contained.</div><div class="sentence"> At the same time, we may note also the transition in the mind of Plato, to which Aristotle alludes (Met.</div><div class="sentence"> ), when, as he says, he transferred the Socratic universal of ethics to the whole of nature.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span> <div class="sentence">  The other criticism of Parmenides on Socrates attributes to him a want of practice in dialectic.</div><div class="sentence"> He has observed this deficiency in him when talking to Aristoteles on a previous occasion.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato seems to imply that there was something more in the dialectic of Zeno than in the mere interrogation of Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> Here, again, he may perhaps be describing the process which his own mind went through when he first became more intimately acquainted, whether at Megara or elsewhere, with the Eleatic and Megarian philosophers.</div><div class="sentence"> Still, Parmenides does not deny to Socrates the credit of having gone beyond them in seeking to apply the paradoxes of Zeno to ideas; and this is the application which he himself makes of them in the latter part of the dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> He then proceeds to explain to him the sort of mental gymnastic which he should practise.</div><div class="sentence"> He should consider not only what would follow from a given hypothesis, but what would follow from the denial of it, to that which is the subject of the hypothesis, and to all other things.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no trace in the Memorabilia of Xenophon of any such method being attributed to Socrates; nor is the dialectic here spoken of that 'favourite method' of proceeding by regular divisions, which is described in the Phaedrus and Philebus, and of which examples are given in the Politicus and in the Sophist.</div><div class="sentence"> It is expressly spoken of as the method which Socrates had heard Zeno practise in the days of his youth (compare Soph.</div><div class="sentence"> ).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span> <div class="sentence">  The discussion of Socrates with Parmenides is one of the most remarkable passages in Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> Few writers have ever been able to anticipate 'the criticism of the morrow' on their favourite notions.</div><div class="sentence"> But Plato may here be said to anticipate the judgment not only of the morrow, but of all after-ages on the Platonic Ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> For in some points he touches questions which have not yet received their solution in modern philosophy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span> <div class="sentence">  The first difficulty which Parmenides raises respecting the Platonic ideas relates to the manner in which individuals are connected with them.</div><div class="sentence"> Do they participate in the ideas, or do they merely resemble them?</div><div class="sentence"> Parmenides shows that objections may be urged against either of these modes of conceiving the connection.</div><div class="sentence"> Things are little by partaking of littleness, great by partaking of greatness, and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> But they cannot partake of a part of greatness, for that will not make them great, etc.</div><div class="sentence"> ; nor can each object monopolise the whole.</div><div class="sentence"> The only answer to this is, that 'partaking' is a figure of speech, really corresponding to the processes which a later logic designates by the terms 'abstraction' and 'generalization.'</div><div class="sentence"> When we have described accurately the methods or forms which the mind employs, we cannot further criticize them; at least we can only criticize them with reference to their fitness as instruments of thought to express facts.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates attempts to support his view of the ideas by the parallel of the day, which is one and in many places; but he is easily driven from his position by a counter illustration of Parmenides, who compares the idea of greatness to a sail.</div><div class="sentence"> He truly explains to Socrates that he has attained the conception of ideas by a process of generalization.</div><div class="sentence"> At the same time, he points out a difficulty, which appears to be involved—viz.</div><div class="sentence"> that the process of generalization will go on to infinity.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates meets the supposed difficulty by a flash of light, which is indeed the true answer 'that the ideas are in our minds only.'</div><div class="sentence"> Neither realism is the truth, nor nominalism is the truth, but conceptualism; and conceptualism or any other psychological theory falls very far short of the infinite subtlety of language and thought.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span> <div class="sentence">  But the realism of ancient philosophy will not admit of this answer, which is repelled by Parmenides with another truth or half-truth of later philosophy, 'Every subject or subjective must have an object.'</div><div class="sentence"> Here is the great though unconscious truth (shall we say?)</div><div class="sentence"> or error, which underlay the early Greek philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Ideas must have a real existence;' they are not mere forms or opinions, which may be changed arbitrarily by individuals.</div><div class="sentence"> But the early Greek philosopher never clearly saw that true ideas were only universal facts, and that there might be error in universals as well as in particulars.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates makes one more attempt to defend the Platonic Ideas by representing them as paradigms; this is again answered by the 'argumentum ad infinitum.'</div><div class="sentence"> We may remark, in passing, that the process which is thus described has no real existence.</div><div class="sentence"> The mind, after having obtained a general idea, does not really go on to form another which includes that, and all the individuals contained under it, and another and another without end.</div><div class="sentence"> The difficulty belongs in fact to the Megarian age of philosophy, and is due to their illogical logic, and to the general ignorance of the ancients respecting the part played by language in the process of thought.</div><div class="sentence"> No such perplexity could ever trouble a modern metaphysician, any more than the fallacy of 'calvus' or 'acervus,' or of 'Achilles and the tortoise.'</div><div class="sentence"> These 'surds' of metaphysics ought to occasion no more difficulty in speculation than a perpetually recurring fraction in arithmetic.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span> <div class="sentence">  It is otherwise with the objection which follows: How are we to bridge the chasm between human truth and absolute truth, between gods and men?</div><div class="sentence"> This is the difficulty of philosophy in all ages: How can we get beyond the circle of our own ideas, or how, remaining within them, can we have any criterion of a truth beyond and independent of them?</div><div class="sentence"> Parmenides draws out this difficulty with great clearness.</div><div class="sentence"> According to him, there are not only one but two chasms: the first, between individuals and the ideas which have a common name; the second, between the ideas in us and the ideas absolute.</div><div class="sentence"> The first of these two difficulties mankind, as we may say, a little parodying the language of the Philebus, have long agreed to treat as obsolete; the second remains a difficulty for us as well as for the Greeks of the fourth century before Christ, and is the stumbling-block of Kant's Kritik, and of the Hamiltonian adaptation of Kant, as well as of the Platonic ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> It has been said that 'you cannot criticize Revelation.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Then how do you know what is Revelation, or that there is one at all,' is the immediate rejoinder—'You know nothing of things in themselves.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'Then how do you know that there are things in themselves?'</div><div class="sentence"> In some respects, the difficulty pressed harder upon the Greek than upon ourselves.</div><div class="sentence"> For conceiving of God more under the attribute of knowledge than we do, he was more under the necessity of separating the divine from the human, as two spheres which had no communication with one another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span> <div class="sentence">  It is remarkable that Plato, speaking by the mouth of Parmenides, does not treat even this second class of difficulties as hopeless or insoluble.</div><div class="sentence"> He says only that they cannot be explained without a long and laborious demonstration: 'The teacher will require superhuman ability, and the learner will be hard of understanding.'</div><div class="sentence"> But an attempt must be made to find an answer to them; for, as Socrates and Parmenides both admit, the denial of abstract ideas is the destruction of the mind.</div><div class="sentence"> We can easily imagine that among the Greek schools of philosophy in the fourth century before Christ a panic might arise from the denial of universals, similar to that which arose in the last century from Hume's denial of our ideas of cause and effect.</div><div class="sentence"> Men do not at first recognize that thought, like digestion, will go on much the same, notwithstanding any theories which may be entertained respecting the nature of the process.</div><div class="sentence"> Parmenides attributes the difficulties in which Socrates is involved to a want of comprehensiveness in his mode of reasoning; he should consider every question on the negative as well as the positive hypothesis, with reference to the consequences which flow from the denial as well as from the assertion of a given statement.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span> <div class="sentence">  The argument which follows is the most singular in Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> It appears to be an imitation, or parody, of the Zenonian dialectic, just as the speeches in the Phaedrus are an imitation of the style of Lysias, or as the derivations in the Cratylus or the fallacies of the Euthydemus are a parody of some contemporary Sophist.</div><div class="sentence"> The interlocutor is not supposed, as in most of the other Platonic dialogues, to take a living part in the argument; he is only required to say 'Yes' and 'No' in the right places.</div><div class="sentence"> A hint has been already given that the paradoxes of Zeno admitted of a higher application.</div><div class="sentence"> This hint is the thread by which Plato connects the two parts of the dialogue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span> <div class="sentence">  The paradoxes of Parmenides seem trivial to us, because the words to which they relate have become trivial; their true nature as abstract terms is perfectly understood by us, and we are inclined to regard the treatment of them in Plato as a mere straw-splitting, or legerdemain of words.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet there was a power in them which fascinated the Neoplatonists for centuries afterwards.</div><div class="sentence"> Something that they found in them, or brought to them—some echo or anticipation of a great truth or error, exercised a wonderful influence over their minds.</div><div class="sentence"> To do the Parmenides justice, we should imagine similar aporiai raised on themes as sacred to us, as the notions of One or Being were to an ancient Eleatic.</div><div class="sentence"> 'If God is, what follows?</div><div class="sentence"> If God is not, what follows?'</div><div class="sentence"> Or again: If God is or is not the world; or if God is or is not many, or has or has not parts, or is or is not in the world, or in time; or is or is not finite or infinite.</div><div class="sentence"> Or if the world is or is not; or has or has not a beginning or end; or is or is not infinite, or infinitely divisible.</div><div class="sentence"> Or again: if God is or is not identical with his laws; or if man is or is not identical with the laws of nature.</div><div class="sentence"> We can easily see that here are many subjects for thought, and that from these and similar hypotheses questions of great interest might arise.</div><div class="sentence"> And we also remark, that the conclusions derived from either of the two alternative propositions might be equally impossible and contradictory.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span> <div class="sentence">  When we ask what is the object of these paradoxes, some have answered that they are a mere logical puzzle, while others have seen in them an Hegelian propaedeutic of the doctrine of Ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> The first of these views derives support from the manner in which Parmenides speaks of a similar method being applied to all Ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet it is hard to suppose that Plato would have furnished so elaborate an example, not of his own but of the Eleatic dialectic, had he intended only to give an illustration of method.</div><div class="sentence"> The second view has been often overstated by those who, like Hegel himself, have tended to confuse ancient with modern philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> We need not deny that Plato, trained in the school of Cratylus and Heracleitus, may have seen that a contradiction in terms is sometimes the best expression of a truth higher than either (compare Soph.).</div><div class="sentence"> But his ideal theory is not based on antinomies.</div><div class="sentence"> The correlation of Ideas was the metaphysical difficulty of the age in which he lived; and the Megarian and Cynic philosophy was a 'reductio ad absurdum' of their isolation.</div><div class="sentence"> To restore them to their natural connexion and to detect the negative element in them is the aim of Plato in the Sophist.</div><div class="sentence"> But his view of their connexion falls very far short of the Hegelian identity of Being and Not-being.</div><div class="sentence"> The Being and Not-being of Plato never merge in each other, though he is aware that 'determination is only negation.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span> <div class="sentence">  After criticizing the hypotheses of others, it may appear presumptuous to add another guess to the many which have been already offered.</div><div class="sentence"> May we say, in Platonic language, that we still seem to see vestiges of a track which has not yet been taken?</div><div class="sentence"> It is quite possible that the obscurity of the Parmenides would not have existed to a contemporary student of philosophy, and, like the similar difficulty in the Philebus, is really due to our ignorance of the mind of the age.</div><div class="sentence"> There is an obscure Megarian influence on Plato which cannot wholly be cleared up, and is not much illustrated by the doubtful tradition of his retirement to Megara after the death of Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> For Megara was within a walk of Athens (Phaedr.</div><div class="sentence"> ), and Plato might have learned the Megarian doctrines without settling there.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span> <div class="sentence">  We may begin by remarking that the theses of Parmenides are expressly said to follow the method of Zeno, and that the complex dilemma, though declared to be capable of universal application, is applied in this instance to Zeno's familiar question of the 'one and many.'</div><div class="sentence"> Here, then, is a double indication of the connexion of the Parmenides with the Eristic school.</div><div class="sentence"> The old Eleatics had asserted the existence of Being, which they at first regarded as finite, then as infinite, then as neither finite nor infinite, to which some of them had given what Aristotle calls 'a form,' others had ascribed a material nature only.</div><div class="sentence"> The tendency of their philosophy was to deny to Being all predicates.</div><div class="sentence"> The Megarians, who succeeded them, like the Cynics, affirmed that no predicate could be asserted of any subject; they also converted the idea of Being into an abstraction of Good, perhaps with the view of preserving a sort of neutrality or indifference between the mind and things.</div><div class="sentence"> As if they had said, in the language of modern philosophy: 'Being is not only neither finite nor infinite, neither at rest nor in motion, but neither subjective nor objective.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span> <div class="sentence">  This is the track along which Plato is leading us.</div><div class="sentence"> Zeno had attempted to prove the existence of the one by disproving the existence of the many, and Parmenides seems to aim at proving the existence of the subject by showing the contradictions which follow from the assertion of any predicates.</div><div class="sentence"> Take the simplest of all notions, 'unity'; you cannot even assert being or time of this without involving a contradiction.</div><div class="sentence"> But is the contradiction also the final conclusion?</div><div class="sentence"> Probably no more than of Zeno's denial of the many, or of Parmenides' assault upon the Ideas; no more than of the earlier dialogues 'of search.'</div><div class="sentence"> To us there seems to be no residuum of this long piece of dialectics.</div><div class="sentence"> But to the mind of Parmenides and Plato, 'Gott-betrunkene Menschen,' there still remained the idea of 'being' or 'good,' which could not be conceived, defined, uttered, but could not be got rid of.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither of them would have imagined that their disputation ever touched the Divine Being (compare Phil.).</div><div class="sentence"> The same difficulties about Unity and Being are raised in the Sophist; but there only as preliminary to their final solution.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span> <div class="sentence">  If this view is correct, the real aim of the hypotheses of Parmenides is to criticize the earlier Eleatic philosophy from the point of view of Zeno or the Megarians.</div><div class="sentence"> It is the same kind of criticism which Plato has extended to his own doctrine of Ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor is there any want of poetical consistency in attributing to the 'father Parmenides' the last review of the Eleatic doctrines.</div><div class="sentence"> The latest phases of all philosophies were fathered upon the founder of the school.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span> <div class="sentence">  Other critics have regarded the final conclusion of the Parmenides either as sceptical or as Heracleitean.</div><div class="sentence"> In the first case, they assume that Plato means to show the impossibility of any truth.</div><div class="sentence"> But this is not the spirit of Plato, and could not with propriety be put into the mouth of Parmenides, who, in this very dialogue, is urging Socrates, not to doubt everything, but to discipline his mind with a view to the more precise attainment of truth.</div><div class="sentence"> The same remark applies to the second of the two theories.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato everywhere ridicules (perhaps unfairly) his Heracleitean contemporaries: and if he had intended to support an Heracleitean thesis, would hardly have chosen Parmenides, the condemner of the 'undiscerning tribe who say that things both are and are not,' to be the speaker.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor, thirdly, can we easily persuade ourselves with Zeller that by the 'one' he means the Idea; and that he is seeking to prove indirectly the unity of the Idea in the multiplicity of phenomena.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span> <div class="sentence">  We may now endeavour to thread the mazes of the labyrinth which Parmenides knew so well, and trembled at the thought of them.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span> <div class="sentence">  1.a.</div><div class="sentence"> One is not many, and therefore has no parts, and therefore is not a whole, which is a sum of parts, and therefore has neither beginning, middle, nor end, and is therefore unlimited, and therefore formless, being neither round nor straight, for neither round nor straight can be defined without assuming that they have parts; and therefore is not in place, whether in another which would encircle and touch the one at many points; or in itself, because that which is self-containing is also contained, and therefore not one but two.</div><div class="sentence"> This being premised, let us consider whether one is capable either of motion or rest.</div><div class="sentence"> For motion is either change of substance, or motion on an axis, or from one place to another.</div><div class="sentence"> But the one is incapable of change of substance, which implies that it ceases to be itself, or of motion on an axis, because there would be parts around the axis; and any other motion involves change of place.</div><div class="sentence"> But existence in place has been already shown to be impossible; and yet more impossible is coming into being in place, which implies partial existence in two places at once, or entire existence neither within nor without the same; and how can this be?</div><div class="sentence"> And more impossible still is the coming into being either as a whole or parts of that which is neither a whole nor parts.</div><div class="sentence"> The one, then, is incapable of motion.</div><div class="sentence"> But neither can the one be in anything, and therefore not in the same, whether itself or some other, and is therefore incapable of rest.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither is one the same with itself or any other, or other than itself or any other.</div><div class="sentence"> For if other than itself, then other than one, and therefore not one; and, if the same with other, it would be other, and other than one.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither can one while remaining one be other than other; for other, and not one, is the other than other.</div><div class="sentence"> But if not other by virtue of being one, not by virtue of itself; and if not by virtue of itself, not itself other, and if not itself other, not other than anything.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither will one be the same with itself.</div><div class="sentence"> For the nature of the same is not that of the one, but a thing which becomes the same with anything does not become one; for example, that which becomes the same with the many becomes many and not one.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore if the one is the same with itself, the one is not one with itself; and therefore one and not one.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore one is neither other than other, nor the same with itself.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither will the one be like or unlike itself or other; for likeness is sameness of affections, and the one and the same are different.</div><div class="sentence"> And one having any affection which is other than being one would be more than one.</div><div class="sentence"> The one, then, cannot have the same affection with and therefore cannot be like itself or other; nor can the one have any other affection than its own, that is, be unlike itself or any other, for this would imply that it was more than one.</div><div class="sentence"> The one, then, is neither like nor unlike itself or other.</div><div class="sentence"> This being the case, neither can the one be equal or unequal to itself or other.</div><div class="sentence"> For equality implies sameness of measure, as inequality implies a greater or less number of measures.</div><div class="sentence"> But the one, not having sameness, cannot have sameness of measure; nor a greater or less number of measures, for that would imply parts and multitude.</div><div class="sentence"> Once more, can one be older or younger than itself or other?</div><div class="sentence"> or of the same age with itself or other?</div><div class="sentence"> That would imply likeness and unlikeness, equality and inequality.</div><div class="sentence"> Therefore one cannot be in time, because that which is in time is ever becoming older and younger than itself, (for older and younger are relative terms, and he who becomes older becomes younger,) and is also of the same age with itself.</div><div class="sentence"> None of which, or any other expressions of time, whether past, future, or present, can be affirmed of one.</div><div class="sentence"> One neither is, has been, nor will be, nor becomes, nor has, nor will become.</div><div class="sentence"> And, as these are the only modes of being, one is not, and is not one.</div><div class="sentence"> But to that which is not, there is no attribute or relative, neither name nor word nor idea nor science nor perception nor opinion appertaining.</div><div class="sentence"> One, then, is neither named, nor uttered, nor known, nor perceived, nor imagined.</div><div class="sentence"> But can all this be true?</div><div class="sentence"> 'I think not.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span> <div class="sentence">  1.b.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us, however, commence the inquiry again.</div><div class="sentence"> We have to work out all the consequences which follow on the assumption that the one is.</div><div class="sentence"> If one is, one partakes of being, which is not the same with one; the words 'being' and 'one' have different meanings.</div><div class="sentence"> Observe the consequence: In the one of being or the being of one are two parts, being and one, which form one whole.</div><div class="sentence"> And each of the two parts is also a whole, and involves the other, and may be further subdivided into one and being, and is therefore not one but two; and thus one is never one, and in this way the one, if it is, becomes many and infinite.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, let us conceive of a one which by an effort of abstraction we separate from being: will this abstract one be one or many?</div><div class="sentence"> You say one only; let us see.</div><div class="sentence"> In the first place, the being of one is other than one; and one and being, if different, are so because they both partake of the nature of other, which is therefore neither one nor being; and whether we take being and other, or being and one, or one and other, in any case we have two things which separately are called either, and together both.</div><div class="sentence"> And both are two and either of two is severally one, and if one be added to any of the pairs, the sum is three; and two is an even number, three an odd; and two units exist twice, and therefore there are twice two; and three units exist thrice, and therefore there are thrice three, and taken together they give twice three and thrice two: we have even numbers multiplied into even, and odd into even, and even into odd numbers.</div><div class="sentence"> But if one is, and both odd and even numbers are implied in one, must not every number exist?</div><div class="sentence"> And number is infinite, and therefore existence must be infinite, for all and every number partakes of being; therefore being has the greatest number of parts, and every part, however great or however small, is equally one.</div><div class="sentence"> But can one be in many places and yet be a whole?</div><div class="sentence"> If not a whole it must be divided into parts and represented by a number corresponding to the number of the parts.</div><div class="sentence"> And if so, we were wrong in saying that being has the greatest number of parts; for being is coequal and coextensive with one, and has no more parts than one; and so the abstract one broken up into parts by being is many and infinite.</div><div class="sentence"> But the parts are parts of a whole, and the whole is their containing limit, and the one is therefore limited as well as infinite in number; and that which is a whole has beginning, middle, and end, and a middle is equidistant from the extremes; and one is therefore of a certain figure, round or straight, or a combination of the two, and being a whole includes all the parts which are the whole, and is therefore self-contained.</div><div class="sentence"> But then, again, the whole is not in the parts, whether all or some.</div><div class="sentence"> Not in all, because, if in all, also in one; for, if wanting in any one, how in all?—not in some, because the greater would then be contained in the less.</div><div class="sentence"> But if not in all, nor in any, nor in some, either nowhere or in other.</div><div class="sentence"> And if nowhere, nothing; therefore in other.</div><div class="sentence"> The one as a whole, then, is in another, but regarded as a sum of parts is in itself; and is, therefore, both in itself and in another.</div><div class="sentence"> This being the case, the one is at once both at rest and in motion: at rest, because resting in itself; in motion, because it is ever in other.</div><div class="sentence"> And if there is truth in what has preceded, one is the same and not the same with itself and other.</div><div class="sentence"> For everything in relation to every other thing is either the same with it or other; or if neither the same nor other, then in the relation of part to a whole or whole to a part.</div><div class="sentence"> But one cannot be a part or whole in relation to one, nor other than one; and is therefore the same with one.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet this sameness is again contradicted by one being in another place from itself which is in the same place; this follows from one being in itself and in another; one, therefore, is other than itself.</div><div class="sentence"> But if anything is other than anything, will it not be other than other?</div><div class="sentence"> And the not one is other than the one, and the one than the not one; therefore one is other than all others.</div><div class="sentence"> But the same and the other exclude one another, and therefore the other can never be in the same; nor can the other be in anything for ever so short a time, as for that time the other will be in the same.</div><div class="sentence"> And the other, if never in the same, cannot be either in the one or in the not one.</div><div class="sentence"> And one is not other than not one, either by reason of other or of itself; and therefore they are not other than one another at all.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither can the not one partake or be part of one, for in that case it would be one; nor can the not one be number, for that also involves one.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore, not being other than the one or related to the one as a whole to parts or parts to a whole, not one is the same as one.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore the one is the same and also not the same with the others and also with itself; and is therefore like and unlike itself and the others, and just as different from the others as they are from the one, neither more nor less.</div><div class="sentence"> But if neither more nor less, equally different; and therefore the one and the others have the same relations.</div><div class="sentence"> This may be illustrated by the case of names: when you repeat the same name twice over, you mean the same thing; and when you say that the other is other than the one, or the one other than the other, this very word other (eteron), which is attributed to both, implies sameness.</div><div class="sentence"> One, then, as being other than others, and other as being other than one, are alike in that they have the relation of otherness; and likeness is similarity of relations.</div><div class="sentence"> And everything as being other of everything is also like everything.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, same and other, like and unlike, are opposites: and since in virtue of being other than the others the one is like them, in virtue of being the same it must be unlike.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, one, as having the same relations, has no difference of relation, and is therefore not unlike, and therefore like; or, as having different relations, is different and unlike.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus, one, as being the same and not the same with itself and others—for both these reasons and for either of them—is also like and unlike itself and the others.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, how far can one touch itself and the others?</div><div class="sentence"> As existing in others, it touches the others; and as existing in itself, touches only itself.</div><div class="sentence"> But from another point of view, that which touches another must be next in order of place; one, therefore, must be next in order of place to itself, and would therefore be two, and in two places.</div><div class="sentence"> But one cannot be two, and therefore cannot be in contact with itself.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor again can one touch the other.</div><div class="sentence"> Two objects are required to make one contact; three objects make two contacts; and all the objects in the world, if placed in a series, would have as many contacts as there are objects, less one.</div><div class="sentence"> But if one only exists, and not two, there is no contact.</div><div class="sentence"> And the others, being other than one, have no part in one, and therefore none in number, and therefore two has no existence, and therefore there is no contact.</div><div class="sentence"> For all which reasons, one has and has not contact with itself and the others.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span> <div class="sentence">  In a similar spirit he criticizes the Eleatic doctrine of Being, not intending to deny Ontology, but showing that the old Eleatic notion, and the very name 'Being,' is unable to maintain itself against the subtleties of the Megarians.</div><div class="sentence"> He did not mean to say that Being or Substance had no existence, but he is preparing for the development of his later view, that ideas were capable of relation.</div><div class="sentence"> The fact that contradictory consequences follow from the existence or non-existence of one or many, does not prove that they have or have not existence, but rather that some different mode of conceiving them is required.</div><div class="sentence"> Parmenides may still have thought that 'Being was,' just as Kant would have asserted the existence of 'things in themselves,' while denying the transcendental use of the Categories.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span> <div class="sentence">  Several lesser links also connect the first and second parts of the dialogue: (1) The thesis is the same as that which Zeno has been already discussing: (2) Parmenides has intimated in the first part, that the method of Zeno should, as Socrates desired, be extended to Ideas: (3) The difficulty of participating in greatness, smallness, equality is urged against the Ideas as well as against the One.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span> <div class="sentence">  II.</div><div class="sentence"> The Parmenides is not only a criticism of the Eleatic notion of Being, but also of the methods of reasoning then in existence, and in this point of view, as well as in the other, may be regarded as an introduction to the Sophist.</div><div class="sentence"> Long ago, in the Euthydemus, the vulgar application of the 'both and neither' Eristic had been subjected to a similar criticism, which there takes the form of banter and irony, here of illustration.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span> <div class="sentence">  The attack upon the Ideas is resumed in the Philebus, and is followed by a return to a more rational philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> The perplexity of the One and Many is there confined to the region of Ideas, and replaced by a theory of classification; the Good arranged in classes is also contrasted with the barren abstraction of the Megarians.</div><div class="sentence"> The war is carried on against the Eristics in all the later dialogues, sometimes with a playful irony, at other times with a sort of contempt.</div><div class="sentence"> But there is no lengthened refutation of them.</div><div class="sentence"> The Parmenides belongs to that stage of the dialogues of Plato in which he is partially under their influence, using them as a sort of 'critics or diviners' of the truth of his own, and of the Eleatic theories.</div><div class="sentence"> In the Theaetetus a similar negative dialectic is employed in the attempt to define science, which after every effort remains undefined still.</div><div class="sentence"> The same question is revived from the objective side in the Sophist: Being and Not-being are no longer exhibited in opposition, but are now reconciled; and the true nature of Not-being is discovered and made the basis of the correlation of ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> Some links are probably missing which might have been supplied if we had trustworthy accounts of Plato's oral teaching.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span> <div class="sentence">  To sum up: the Parmenides of Plato is a critique, first, of the Platonic Ideas, and secondly, of the Eleatic doctrine of Being.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither are absolutely denied.</div><div class="sentence"> But certain difficulties and consequences are shown in the assumption of either, which prove that the Platonic as well as the Eleatic doctrine must be remodelled.</div><div class="sentence"> The negation and contradiction which are involved in the conception of the One and Many are preliminary to their final adjustment.</div><div class="sentence"> The Platonic Ideas are tested by the interrogative method of Socrates; the Eleatic One or Being is tried by the severer and perhaps impossible method of hypothetical consequences, negative and affirmative.</div><div class="sentence"> In the latter we have an example of the Zenonian or Megarian dialectic, which proceeded, not 'by assailing premises, but conclusions'; this is worked out and improved by Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> When primary abstractions are used in every conceivable sense, any or every conclusion may be deduced from them.</div><div class="sentence"> The words 'one,' 'other,' 'being,' 'like,' 'same,' 'whole,' and their opposites, have slightly different meanings, as they are applied to objects of thought or objects of sense—to number, time, place, and to the higher ideas of the reason;—and out of their different meanings this 'feast' of contradictions 'has been provided.'</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span> <div class="sentence">  The Parmenides of Plato belongs to a stage of philosophy which has passed away.</div><div class="sentence"> At first we read it with a purely antiquarian or historical interest; and with difficulty throw ourselves back into a state of the human mind in which Unity and Being occupied the attention of philosophers.</div><div class="sentence"> We admire the precision of the language, in which, as in some curious puzzle, each word is exactly fitted into every other, and long trains of argument are carried out with a sort of geometrical accuracy.</div><div class="sentence"> We doubt whether any abstract notion could stand the searching cross-examination of Parmenides; and may at last perhaps arrive at the conclusion that Plato has been using an imaginary method to work out an unmeaning conclusion.</div><div class="sentence"> But the truth is, that he is carrying on a process which is not either useless or unnecessary in any age of philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> We fail to understand him, because we do not realize that the questions which he is discussing could have had any value or importance.</div><div class="sentence"> We suppose them to be like the speculations of some of the Schoolmen, which end in nothing.</div><div class="sentence"> But in truth he is trying to get rid of the stumbling-blocks of thought which beset his contemporaries.</div><div class="sentence"> Seeing that the Megarians and Cynics were making knowledge impossible, he takes their 'catch-words' and analyzes them from every conceivable point of view.</div><div class="sentence"> He is criticizing the simplest and most general of our ideas, in which, as they are the most comprehensive, the danger of error is the most serious; for, if they remain unexamined, as in a mathematical demonstration, all that flows from them is affected, and the error pervades knowledge far and wide.</div><div class="sentence"> In the beginning of philosophy this correction of human ideas was even more necessary than in our own times, because they were more bound up with words; and words when once presented to the mind exercised a greater power over thought.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a natural realism which says, 'Can there be a word devoid of meaning, or an idea which is an idea of nothing?'</div><div class="sentence"> In modern times mankind have often given too great importance to a word or idea.</div><div class="sentence"> The philosophy of the ancients was still more in slavery to them, because they had not the experience of error, which would have placed them above the illusion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span> <div class="sentence">  The method of the Parmenides may be compared with the process of purgation, which Bacon sought to introduce into philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato is warning us against two sorts of 'Idols of the Den': first, his own Ideas, which he himself having created is unable to connect in any way with the external world; secondly, against two idols in particular, 'Unity' and 'Being,' which had grown up in the pre-Socratic philosophy, and were still standing in the way of all progress and development of thought.</div><div class="sentence"> He does not say with Bacon, 'Let us make truth by experiment,' or 'From these vague and inexact notions let us turn to facts.'</div><div class="sentence"> The time has not yet arrived for a purely inductive philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> The instruments of thought must first be forged, that they may be used hereafter by modern inquirers.</div><div class="sentence"> How, while mankind were disputing about universals, could they classify phenomena?</div><div class="sentence"> How could they investigate causes, when they had not as yet learned to distinguish between a cause and an end?</div><div class="sentence"> How could they make any progress in the sciences without first arranging them?</div><div class="sentence"> These are the deficiencies which Plato is seeking to supply in an age when knowledge was a shadow of a name only.</div><div class="sentence"> In the earlier dialogues the Socratic conception of universals is illustrated by his genius; in the Phaedrus the nature of division is explained; in the Republic the law of contradiction and the unity of knowledge are asserted; in the later dialogues he is constantly engaged both with the theory and practice of classification.</div><div class="sentence"> These were the 'new weapons,' as he terms them in the Philebus, which he was preparing for the use of some who, in after ages, would be found ready enough to disown their obligations to the great master, or rather, perhaps, would be incapable of understanding them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span> <div class="sentence">  Numberless fallacies, as we are often truly told, have originated in a confusion of the 'copula,' and the 'verb of existence.'</div><div class="sentence"> Would not the distinction which Plato by the mouth of Parmenides makes between 'One is one' and 'One has being' have saved us from this and many similar confusions?</div><div class="sentence"> We see again that a long period in the history of philosophy was a barren tract, not uncultivated, but unfruitful, because there was no inquiry into the relation of language and thought, and the metaphysical imagination was incapable of supplying the missing link between words and things.</div><div class="sentence"> The famous dispute between Nominalists and Realists would never have been heard of, if, instead of transferring the Platonic Ideas into a crude Latin phraseology, the spirit of Plato had been truly understood and appreciated.</div><div class="sentence"> Upon the term substance at least two celebrated theological controversies appear to hinge, which would not have existed, or at least not in their present form, if we had 'interrogated' the word substance, as Plato has the notions of Unity and Being.</div><div class="sentence"> These weeds of philosophy have struck their roots deep into the soil, and are always tending to reappear, sometimes in new-fangled forms; while similar words, such as development, evolution, law, and the like, are constantly put in the place of facts, even by writers who profess to base truth entirely upon fact.</div><div class="sentence"> In an unmetaphysical age there is probably more metaphysics in the common sense (i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> more a priori assumption) than in any other, because there is more complete unconsciousness that we are resting on our own ideas, while we please ourselves with the conviction that we are resting on facts.</div><div class="sentence"> We do not consider how much metaphysics are required to place us above metaphysics, or how difficult it is to prevent the forms of expression which are ready made for our use from outrunning actual observation and experiment.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span> <div class="sentence">  In the last century the educated world were astonished to find that the whole fabric of their ideas was falling to pieces, because Hume amused himself by analyzing the word 'cause' into uniform sequence.</div><div class="sentence"> Then arose a philosophy which, equally regardless of the history of the mind, sought to save mankind from scepticism by assigning to our notions of 'cause and effect,' 'substance and accident,' 'whole and part,' a necessary place in human thought.</div><div class="sentence"> Without them we could have no experience, and therefore they were supposed to be prior to experience—to be incrusted on the 'I'; although in the phraseology of Kant there could be no transcendental use of them, or, in other words, they were only applicable within the range of our knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> But into the origin of these ideas, which he obtains partly by an analysis of the proposition, partly by development of the 'ego,' he never inquires—they seem to him to have a necessary existence; nor does he attempt to analyse the various senses in which the word 'cause' or 'substance' may be employed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span> <div class="sentence">  The philosophy of Berkeley could never have had any meaning, even to himself, if he had first analyzed from every point of view the conception of 'matter.'</div><div class="sentence"> This poor forgotten word (which was 'a very good word' to describe the simplest generalization of external objects) is now superseded in the vocabulary of physical philosophers by 'force,' which seems to be accepted without any rigid examination of its meaning, as if the general idea of 'force' in our minds furnished an explanation of the infinite variety of forces which exist in the universe.</div><div class="sentence"> A similar ambiguity occurs in the use of the favourite word 'law,' which is sometimes regarded as a mere abstraction, and then elevated into a real power or entity, almost taking the place of God.</div><div class="sentence"> Theology, again, is full of undefined terms which have distracted the human mind for ages.</div><div class="sentence"> Mankind have reasoned from them, but not to them; they have drawn out the conclusions without proving the premises; they have asserted the premises without examining the terms.</div><div class="sentence"> The passions of religious parties have been roused to the utmost about words of which they could have given no explanation, and which had really no distinct meaning.</div><div class="sentence"> One sort of them, faith, grace, justification, have been the symbols of one class of disputes; as the words substance, nature, person, of another, revelation, inspiration, and the like, of a third.</div><div class="sentence"> All of them have been the subject of endless reasonings and inferences; but a spell has hung over the minds of theologians or philosophers which has prevented them from examining the words themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> Either the effort to rise above and beyond their own first ideas was too great for them, or there might, perhaps, have seemed to be an irreverence in doing so.</div><div class="sentence"> About the Divine Being Himself, in whom all true theological ideas live and move, men have spoken and reasoned much, and have fancied that they instinctively know Him.</div><div class="sentence"> But they hardly suspect that under the name of God even Christians have included two characters or natures as much opposed as the good and evil principle of the Persians.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span> <div class="sentence">  To have the true use of words we must compare them with things; in using them we acknowledge that they seldom give a perfect representation of our meaning.</div><div class="sentence"> In like manner when we interrogate our ideas we find that we are not using them always in the sense which we supposed.</div><div class="sentence"> And Plato, while he criticizes the inconsistency of his own doctrine of universals and draws out the endless consequences which flow from the assertion either that 'Being is' or that 'Being is not,' by no means intends to deny the existence of universals or the unity under which they are comprehended.</div><div class="sentence"> There is nothing further from his thoughts than scepticism.</div><div class="sentence"> But before proceeding he must examine the foundations which he and others have been laying; there is nothing true which is not from some point of view untrue, nothing absolute which is not also relative (compare Republic).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span> <div class="sentence">  And so, in modern times, because we are called upon to analyze our ideas and to come to a distinct understanding about the meaning of words; because we know that the powers of language are very unequal to the subtlety of nature or of mind, we do not therefore renounce the use of them; but we replace them in their old connexion, having first tested their meaning and quality, and having corrected the error which is involved in them; or rather always remembering to make allowance for the adulteration or alloy which they contain.</div><div class="sentence"> We cannot call a new metaphysical world into existence any more than we can frame a new universal language; in thought as in speech, we are dependent on the past.</div><div class="sentence"> We know that the words 'cause' and 'effect' are very far from representing to us the continuity or the complexity of nature or the different modes or degrees in which phenomena are connected.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet we accept them as the best expression which we have of the correlation of forces or objects.</div><div class="sentence"> We see that the term 'law' is a mere abstraction, under which laws of matter and of mind, the law of nature and the law of the land are included, and some of these uses of the word are confusing, because they introduce into one sphere of thought associations which belong to another; for example, order or sequence is apt to be confounded with external compulsion and the internal workings of the mind with their material antecedents.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet none of them can be dispensed with; we can only be on our guard against the error or confusion which arises out of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus in the use of the word 'substance' we are far from supposing that there is any mysterious substratum apart from the objects which we see, and we acknowledge that the negative notion is very likely to become a positive one.</div><div class="sentence"> Still we retain the word as a convenient generalization, though not without a double sense, substance, and essence, derived from the two-fold translation of the Greek ousia.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">074</span> <div class="sentence">  So the human mind makes the reflection that God is not a person like ourselves—is not a cause like the material causes in nature, nor even an intelligent cause like a human agent—nor an individual, for He is universal; and that every possible conception which we can form of Him is limited by the human faculties.</div><div class="sentence"> We cannot by any effort of thought or exertion of faith be in and out of our own minds at the same instant.</div><div class="sentence"> How can we conceive Him under the forms of time and space, who is out of time and space?</div><div class="sentence"> How get rid of such forms and see Him as He is?</div><div class="sentence"> How can we imagine His relation to the world or to ourselves?</div><div class="sentence"> Innumerable contradictions follow from either of the two alternatives, that God is or that He is not.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet we are far from saying that we know nothing of Him, because all that we know is subject to the conditions of human thought.</div><div class="sentence"> To the old belief in Him we return, but with corrections.</div><div class="sentence"> He is a person, but not like ourselves; a mind, but not a human mind; a cause, but not a material cause, nor yet a maker or artificer.</div><div class="sentence"> The words which we use are imperfect expressions of His true nature; but we do not therefore lose faith in what is best and highest in ourselves and in the world.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span> <div class="sentence">  'A little philosophy takes us away from God; a great deal brings us back to Him.'</div><div class="sentence"> When we begin to reflect, our first thoughts respecting Him and ourselves are apt to be sceptical.</div><div class="sentence"> For we can analyze our religious as well as our other ideas; we can trace their history; we can criticize their perversion; we see that they are relative to the human mind and to one another.</div><div class="sentence"> But when we have carried our criticism to the furthest point, they still remain, a necessity of our moral nature, better known and understood by us, and less liable to be shaken, because we are more aware of their necessary imperfection.</div><div class="sentence"> They come to us with 'better opinion, better confirmation,' not merely as the inspirations either of ourselves or of another, but deeply rooted in history and in the human mind.</div></div>

<h2>PARMENIDES</h2>


<div class="description">
<div class="book_description">PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:</div> Cephalus, Adeimantus, Glaucon, Antiphon, Pythodorus, Socrates, Zeno, Parmenides, Aristoteles. 
</div><div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  Cephalus rehearses a dialogue which is supposed to have been narrated in his presence by Antiphon, the half-brother of Adeimantus and Glaucon, to certain Clazomenians.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  We had come from our home at Clazomenae to Athens, and met Adeimantus and Glaucon in the Agora.</div><div class="sentence"> Welcome, Cephalus, said Adeimantus, taking me by the hand; is there anything which we can do for you in Athens?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes; that is why I am here; I wish to ask a favour of you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  What may that be?</div><div class="sentence"> he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  I want you to tell me the name of your half brother, which I have forgotten; he was a mere child when I last came hither from Clazomenae, but that was a long time ago; his father's name, if I remember rightly, was Pyrilampes?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, he said, and the name of our brother, Antiphon; but why do you ask?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  Let me introduce some countrymen of mine, I said; they are lovers of philosophy, and have heard that Antiphon was intimate with a certain Pythodorus, a friend of Zeno, and remembers a conversation which took place between Socrates, Zeno, and Parmenides many years ago, Pythodorus having often recited it to him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span> <div class="sentence">  And could we hear it?</div><div class="sentence"> I asked.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span> <div class="sentence">  Nothing easier, he replied; when he was a youth he made a careful study of the piece; at present his thoughts run in another direction; like his grandfather Antiphon he is devoted to horses.</div><div class="sentence"> But, if that is what you want, let us go and look for him; he dwells at Melita, which is quite near, and he has only just left us to go home.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span> <div class="sentence">  Accordingly we went to look for him; he was at home, and in the act of giving a bridle to a smith to be fitted.</div><div class="sentence"> When he had done with the smith, his brothers told him the purpose of our visit; and he saluted me as an acquaintance whom he remembered from my former visit, and we asked him to repeat the dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> At first he was not very willing, and complained of the trouble, but at length he consented.</div><div class="sentence"> He told us that Pythodorus had described to him the appearance of Parmenides and Zeno; they came to Athens, as he said, at the great Panathenaea; the former was, at the time of his visit, about 65 years old, very white with age, but well favoured.</div><div class="sentence"> Zeno was nearly 40 years of age, tall and fair to look upon; in the days of his youth he was reported to have been beloved by Parmenides.</div><div class="sentence"> He said that they lodged with Pythodorus in the Ceramicus, outside the wall, whither Socrates, then a very young man, came to see them, and many others with him; they wanted to hear the writings of Zeno, which had been brought to Athens for the first time on the occasion of their visit.</div><div class="sentence"> These Zeno himself read to them in the absence of Parmenides, and had very nearly finished when Pythodorus entered, and with him Parmenides and Aristoteles who was afterwards one of the Thirty, and heard the little that remained of the dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> Pythodorus had heard Zeno repeat them before.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span> <div class="sentence">  When the recitation was completed, Socrates requested that the first thesis of the first argument might be read over again, and this having been done, he said: What is your meaning, Zeno?</div><div class="sentence"> Do you maintain that if being is many, it must be both like and unlike, and that this is impossible, for neither can the like be unlike, nor the unlike like—is that your position?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span> <div class="sentence">  Just so, said Zeno.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span> <div class="sentence">  And if the unlike cannot be like, or the like unlike, then according to you, being could not be many; for this would involve an impossibility.</div><div class="sentence"> In all that you say have you any other purpose except to disprove the being of the many?</div><div class="sentence"> and is not each division of your treatise intended to furnish a separate proof of this, there being in all as many proofs of the not-being of the many as you have composed arguments?</div><div class="sentence"> Is that your meaning, or have I misunderstood you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span> <div class="sentence">  No, said Zeno; you have correctly understood my general purpose.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span> <div class="sentence">  I see, Parmenides, said Socrates, that Zeno would like to be not only one with you in friendship but your second self in his writings too; he puts what you say in another way, and would fain make believe that he is telling us something which is new.</div><div class="sentence"> For you, in your poems, say The All is one, and of this you adduce excellent proofs; and he on the other hand says There is no many; and on behalf of this he offers overwhelming evidence.</div><div class="sentence"> You affirm unity, he denies plurality.</div><div class="sentence"> And so you deceive the world into believing that you are saying different things when really you are saying much the same.</div><div class="sentence"> This is a strain of art beyond the reach of most of us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates, said Zeno.</div><div class="sentence"> But although you are as keen as a Spartan hound in pursuing the track, you do not fully apprehend the true motive of the composition, which is not really such an artificial work as you imagine; for what you speak of was an accident; there was no pretence of a great purpose; nor any serious intention of deceiving the world.</div><div class="sentence"> The truth is, that these writings of mine were meant to protect the arguments of Parmenides against those who make fun of him and seek to show the many ridiculous and contradictory results which they suppose to follow from the affirmation of the one.</div><div class="sentence"> My answer is addressed to the partisans of the many, whose attack I return with interest by retorting upon them that their hypothesis of the being of many, if carried out, appears to be still more ridiculous than the hypothesis of the being of one.</div><div class="sentence"> Zeal for my master led me to write the book in the days of my youth, but some one stole the copy; and therefore I had no choice whether it should be published or not; the motive, however, of writing, was not the ambition of an elder man, but the pugnacity of a young one.</div><div class="sentence"> This you do not seem to see, Socrates; though in other respects, as I was saying, your notion is a very just one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span> <div class="sentence">  I understand, said Socrates, and quite accept your account.</div><div class="sentence"> But tell me, Zeno, do you not further think that there is an idea of likeness in itself, and another idea of unlikeness, which is the opposite of likeness, and that in these two, you and I and all other things to which we apply the term many, participate—things which participate in likeness become in that degree and manner like; and so far as they participate in unlikeness become in that degree unlike, or both like and unlike in the degree in which they participate in both?</div><div class="sentence"> And may not all things partake of both opposites, and be both like and unlike, by reason of this participation?—Where is the wonder?</div><div class="sentence"> Now if a person could prove the absolute like to become unlike, or the absolute unlike to become like, that, in my opinion, would indeed be a wonder; but there is nothing extraordinary, Zeno, in showing that the things which only partake of likeness and unlikeness experience both.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor, again, if a person were to show that all is one by partaking of one, and at the same time many by partaking of many, would that be very astonishing.</div><div class="sentence"> But if he were to show me that the absolute one was many, or the absolute many one, I should be truly amazed.</div><div class="sentence"> And so of all the rest: I should be surprised to hear that the natures or ideas themselves had these opposite qualities; but not if a person wanted to prove of me that I was many and also one.</div><div class="sentence"> When he wanted to show that I was many he would say that I have a right and a left side, and a front and a back, and an upper and a lower half, for I cannot deny that I partake of multitude; when, on the other hand, he wants to prove that I am one, he will say, that we who are here assembled are seven, and that I am one and partake of the one.</div><div class="sentence"> In both instances he proves his case.</div><div class="sentence"> So again, if a person shows that such things as wood, stones, and the like, being many are also one, we admit that he shows the coexistence of the one and many, but he does not show that the many are one or the one many; he is uttering not a paradox but a truism.</div><div class="sentence"> If however, as I just now suggested, some one were to abstract simple notions of like, unlike, one, many, rest, motion, and similar ideas, and then to show that these admit of admixture and separation in themselves, I should be very much astonished.</div><div class="sentence"> This part of the argument appears to be treated by you, Zeno, in a very spirited manner; but, as I was saying, I should be far more amazed if any one found in the ideas themselves which are apprehended by reason, the same puzzle and entanglement which you have shown to exist in visible objects.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span> <div class="sentence">  While Socrates was speaking, Pythodorus thought that Parmenides and Zeno were not altogether pleased at the successive steps of the argument; but still they gave the closest attention, and often looked at one another, and smiled as if in admiration of him.</div><div class="sentence"> When he had finished, Parmenides expressed their feelings in the following words:—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates, he said, I admire the bent of your mind towards philosophy; tell me now, was this your own distinction between ideas in themselves and the things which partake of them?</div><div class="sentence"> and do you think that there is an idea of likeness apart from the likeness which we possess, and of the one and many, and of the other things which Zeno mentioned?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span> <div class="sentence">  I think that there are such ideas, said Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span> <div class="sentence">  Parmenides proceeded: And would you also make absolute ideas of the just and the beautiful and the good, and of all that class?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, he said, I should.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span> <div class="sentence">  And would you make an idea of man apart from us and from all other human creatures, or of fire and water?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span> <div class="sentence">  I am often undecided, Parmenides, as to whether I ought to include them or not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span> <div class="sentence">  And would you feel equally undecided, Socrates, about things of which the mention may provoke a smile?—I mean such things as hair, mud, dirt, or anything else which is vile and paltry; would you suppose that each of these has an idea distinct from the actual objects with which we come into contact, or not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not, said Socrates; visible things like these are such as they appear to us, and I am afraid that there would be an absurdity in assuming any idea of them, although I sometimes get disturbed, and begin to think that there is nothing without an idea; but then again, when I have taken up this position, I run away, because I am afraid that I may fall into a bottomless pit of nonsense, and perish; and so I return to the ideas of which I was just now speaking, and occupy myself with them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates, said Parmenides; that is because you are still young; the time will come, if I am not mistaken, when philosophy will have a firmer grasp of you, and then you will not despise even the meanest things; at your age, you are too much disposed to regard the opinions of men.</div><div class="sentence"> But I should like to know whether you mean that there are certain ideas of which all other things partake, and from which they derive their names; that similars, for example, become similar, because they partake of similarity; and great things become great, because they partake of greatness; and that just and beautiful things become just and beautiful, because they partake of justice and beauty?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, certainly, said Socrates that is my meaning.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span> <div class="sentence">  Then each individual partakes either of the whole of the idea or else of a part of the idea?</div><div class="sentence"> Can there be any other mode of participation?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span> <div class="sentence">  There cannot be, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span> <div class="sentence">  Then do you think that the whole idea is one, and yet, being one, is in each one of the many?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span> <div class="sentence">  Why not, Parmenides?</div><div class="sentence"> said Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span> <div class="sentence">  Because one and the same thing will exist as a whole at the same time in many separate individuals, and will therefore be in a state of separation from itself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span> <div class="sentence">  Nay, but the idea may be like the day which is one and the same in many places at once, and yet continuous with itself; in this way each idea may be one and the same in all at the same time.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span> <div class="sentence">  I like your way, Socrates, of making one in many places at once.</div><div class="sentence"> You mean to say, that if I were to spread out a sail and cover a number of men, there would be one whole including many—is not that your meaning?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span> <div class="sentence">  I think so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span> <div class="sentence">  And would you say that the whole sail includes each man, or a part of it only, and different parts different men?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span> <div class="sentence">  The latter.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">040</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, Socrates, the ideas themselves will be divisible, and things which participate in them will have a part of them only and not the whole idea existing in each of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span> <div class="sentence">  That seems to follow.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span> <div class="sentence">  Then would you like to say, Socrates, that the one idea is really divisible and yet remains one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">043</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">044</span> <div class="sentence">  Suppose that you divide absolute greatness, and that of the many great things, each one is great in virtue of a portion of greatness less than absolute greatness—is that conceivable?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">046</span> <div class="sentence">  Or will each equal thing, if possessing some small portion of equality less than absolute equality, be equal to some other thing by virtue of that portion only?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">047</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">048</span> <div class="sentence">  Or suppose one of us to have a portion of smallness; this is but a part of the small, and therefore the absolutely small is greater; if the absolutely small be greater, that to which the part of the small is added will be smaller and not greater than before.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">049</span> <div class="sentence">  How absurd!</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">050</span> <div class="sentence">  Then in what way, Socrates, will all things participate in the ideas, if they are unable to participate in them either as parts or wholes?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span> <div class="sentence">  Indeed, he said, you have asked a question which is not easily answered.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, said Parmenides, and what do you say of another question?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span> <div class="sentence">  What question?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span> <div class="sentence">  I imagine that the way in which you are led to assume one idea of each kind is as follows:—You see a number of great objects, and when you look at them there seems to you to be one and the same idea (or nature) in them all; hence you conceive of greatness as one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true, said Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span> <div class="sentence">  And if you go on and allow your mind in like manner to embrace in one view the idea of greatness and of great things which are not the idea, and to compare them, will not another greatness arise, which will appear to be the source of all these?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span> <div class="sentence">  It would seem so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span> <div class="sentence">  Then another idea of greatness now comes into view over and above absolute greatness, and the individuals which partake of it; and then another, over and above all these, by virtue of which they will all be great, and so each idea instead of being one will be infinitely multiplied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span> <div class="sentence">  But may not the ideas, asked Socrates, be thoughts only, and have no proper existence except in our minds, Parmenides?</div><div class="sentence"> For in that case each idea may still be one, and not experience this infinite multiplication.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span> <div class="sentence">  And can there be individual thoughts which are thoughts of nothing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span> <div class="sentence">  The thought must be of something?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span> <div class="sentence">  Of something which is or which is not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span> <div class="sentence">  Of something which is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span> <div class="sentence">  Must it not be of a single something, which the thought recognizes as attaching to all, being a single form or nature?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span> <div class="sentence">  And will not the something which is apprehended as one and the same in all, be an idea?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span> <div class="sentence">  From that, again, there is no escape.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, said Parmenides, if you say that everything else participates in the ideas, must you not say either that everything is made up of thoughts, and that all things think; or that they are thoughts but have no thought?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span> <div class="sentence">  The latter view, Parmenides, is no more rational than the previous one.</div><div class="sentence"> In my opinion, the ideas are, as it were, patterns fixed in nature, and other things are like them, and resemblances of them—what is meant by the participation of other things in the ideas, is really assimilation to them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span> <div class="sentence">  But if, said he, the individual is like the idea, must not the idea also be like the individual, in so far as the individual is a resemblance of the idea?</div><div class="sentence"> That which is like, cannot be conceived of as other than the like of like.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">074</span> <div class="sentence">  And when two things are alike, must they not partake of the same idea?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span> <div class="sentence">  They must.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">076</span> <div class="sentence">  And will not that of which the two partake, and which makes them alike, be the idea itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">078</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the idea cannot be like the individual, or the individual like the idea; for if they are alike, some further idea of likeness will always be coming to light, and if that be like anything else, another; and new ideas will be always arising, if the idea resembles that which partakes of it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">079</span> <div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span> <div class="sentence">  The theory, then, that other things participate in the ideas by resemblance, has to be given up, and some other mode of participation devised?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">081</span> <div class="sentence">  It would seem so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">082</span> <div class="sentence">  Do you see then, Socrates, how great is the difficulty of affirming the ideas to be absolute?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">083</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, indeed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">084</span> <div class="sentence">  And, further, let me say that as yet you only understand a small part of the difficulty which is involved if you make of each thing a single idea, parting it off from other things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">085</span> <div class="sentence">  What difficulty?</div><div class="sentence"> he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">086</span> <div class="sentence">  There are many, but the greatest of all is this:—If an opponent argues that these ideas, being such as we say they ought to be, must remain unknown, no one can prove to him that he is wrong, unless he who denies their existence be a man of great ability and knowledge, and is willing to follow a long and laborious demonstration; he will remain unconvinced, and still insist that they cannot be known.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span> <div class="sentence">  What do you mean, Parmenides?</div><div class="sentence"> said Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">088</span> <div class="sentence">  In the first place, I think, Socrates, that you, or any one who maintains the existence of absolute essences, will admit that they cannot exist in us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span> <div class="sentence">  No, said Socrates; for then they would be no longer absolute.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span> <div class="sentence">  True, he said; and therefore when ideas are what they are in relation to one another, their essence is determined by a relation among themselves, and has nothing to do with the resemblances, or whatever they are to be termed, which are in our sphere, and from which we receive this or that name when we partake of them.</div><div class="sentence"> And the things which are within our sphere and have the same names with them, are likewise only relative to one another, and not to the ideas which have the same names with them, but belong to themselves and not to them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span> <div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div><div class="sentence"> said Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span> <div class="sentence">  I may illustrate my meaning in this way, said Parmenides:—A master has a slave; now there is nothing absolute in the relation between them, which is simply a relation of one man to another.</div><div class="sentence"> But there is also an idea of mastership in the abstract, which is relative to the idea of slavery in the abstract.</div><div class="sentence"> These natures have nothing to do with us, nor we with them; they are concerned with themselves only, and we with ourselves.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you see my meaning?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">093</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, said Socrates, I quite see your meaning.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span> <div class="sentence">  And will not knowledge—I mean absolute knowledge—answer to absolute truth?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span> <div class="sentence">  And each kind of absolute knowledge will answer to each kind of absolute being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">098</span> <div class="sentence">  But the knowledge which we have, will answer to the truth which we have; and again, each kind of knowledge which we have, will be a knowledge of each kind of being which we have?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">100</span> <div class="sentence">  But the ideas themselves, as you admit, we have not, and cannot have?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span> <div class="sentence">  No, we cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span> <div class="sentence">  And the absolute natures or kinds are known severally by the absolute idea of knowledge?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">103</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span> <div class="sentence">  And we have not got the idea of knowledge?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span> <div class="sentence">  Then none of the ideas are known to us, because we have no share in absolute knowledge?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span> <div class="sentence">  I suppose not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the nature of the beautiful in itself, and of the good in itself, and all other ideas which we suppose to exist absolutely, are unknown to us?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">109</span> <div class="sentence">  It would seem so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span> <div class="sentence">  I think that there is a stranger consequence still.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">111</span> <div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">112</span> <div class="sentence">  Would you, or would you not say, that absolute knowledge, if there is such a thing, must be a far more exact knowledge than our knowledge; and the same of beauty and of the rest?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">113</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">114</span> <div class="sentence">  And if there be such a thing as participation in absolute knowledge, no one is more likely than God to have this most exact knowledge?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">115</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">116</span> <div class="sentence">  But then, will God, having absolute knowledge, have a knowledge of human things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">117</span> <div class="sentence">  Why not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">118</span> <div class="sentence">  Because, Socrates, said Parmenides, we have admitted that the ideas are not valid in relation to human things; nor human things in relation to them; the relations of either are limited to their respective spheres.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">119</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, that has been admitted.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">120</span> <div class="sentence">  And if God has this perfect authority, and perfect knowledge, his authority cannot rule us, nor his knowledge know us, or any human thing; just as our authority does not extend to the gods, nor our knowledge know anything which is divine, so by parity of reason they, being gods, are not our masters, neither do they know the things of men.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">121</span> <div class="sentence">  Yet, surely, said Socrates, to deprive God of knowledge is monstrous.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">122</span> <div class="sentence">  These, Socrates, said Parmenides, are a few, and only a few of the difficulties in which we are involved if ideas really are and we determine each one of them to be an absolute unity.</div><div class="sentence"> He who hears what may be said against them will deny the very existence of them—and even if they do exist, he will say that they must of necessity be unknown to man; and he will seem to have reason on his side, and as we were remarking just now, will be very difficult to convince; a man must be gifted with very considerable ability before he can learn that everything has a class and an absolute essence; and still more remarkable will he be who discovers all these things for himself, and having thoroughly investigated them is able to teach them to others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">123</span> <div class="sentence">  I agree with you, Parmenides, said Socrates; and what you say is very much to my mind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">124</span> <div class="sentence">  And yet, Socrates, said Parmenides, if a man, fixing his attention on these and the like difficulties, does away with ideas of things and will not admit that every individual thing has its own determinate idea which is always one and the same, he will have nothing on which his mind can rest; and so he will utterly destroy the power of reasoning, as you seem to me to have particularly noted.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">125</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true, he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">126</span> <div class="sentence">  But, then, what is to become of philosophy?</div><div class="sentence"> Whither shall we turn, if the ideas are unknown?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">127</span> <div class="sentence">  I certainly do not see my way at present.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">128</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, said Parmenides; and I think that this arises, Socrates, out of your attempting to define the beautiful, the just, the good, and the ideas generally, without sufficient previous training.</div><div class="sentence"> I noticed your deficiency, when I heard you talking here with your friend Aristoteles, the day before yesterday.</div><div class="sentence"> The impulse that carries you towards philosophy is assuredly noble and divine; but there is an art which is called by the vulgar idle talking, and which is often imagined to be useless; in that you must train and exercise yourself, now that you are young, or truth will elude your grasp.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">129</span> <div class="sentence">  And what is the nature of this exercise, Parmenides, which you would recommend?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">130</span> <div class="sentence">  That which you heard Zeno practising; at the same time, I give you credit for saying to him that you did not care to examine the perplexity in reference to visible things, or to consider the question that way; but only in reference to objects of thought, and to what may be called ideas.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">131</span> <div class="sentence">  Why, yes, he said, there appears to me to be no difficulty in showing by this method that visible things are like and unlike and may experience anything.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">132</span> <div class="sentence">  Quite true, said Parmenides; but I think that you should go a step further, and consider not only the consequences which flow from a given hypothesis, but also the consequences which flow from denying the hypothesis; and that will be still better training for you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">133</span> <div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div><div class="sentence"> he said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">134</span> <div class="sentence">  I mean, for example, that in the case of this very hypothesis of Zeno's about the many, you should inquire not only what will be the consequences to the many in relation to themselves and to the one, and to the one in relation to itself and the many, on the hypothesis of the being of the many, but also what will be the consequences to the one and the many in their relation to themselves and to each other, on the opposite hypothesis.</div><div class="sentence"> Or, again, if likeness is or is not, what will be the consequences in either of these cases to the subjects of the hypothesis, and to other things, in relation both to themselves and to one another, and so of unlikeness; and the same holds good of motion and rest, of generation and destruction, and even of being and not-being.</div><div class="sentence"> In a word, when you suppose anything to be or not to be, or to be in any way affected, you must look at the consequences in relation to the thing itself, and to any other things which you choose,—to each of them singly, to more than one, and to all; and so of other things, you must look at them in relation to themselves and to anything else which you suppose either to be or not to be, if you would train yourself perfectly and see the real truth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">135</span> <div class="sentence">  That, Parmenides, is a tremendous business of which you speak, and I do not quite understand you; will you take some hypothesis and go through the steps?—then I shall apprehend you better.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">136</span> <div class="sentence">  That, Socrates, is a serious task to impose on a man of my years.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">137</span> <div class="sentence">  Then will you, Zeno?</div><div class="sentence"> said Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">138</span> <div class="sentence">  Zeno answered with a smile:—Let us make our petition to Parmenides himself, who is quite right in saying that you are hardly aware of the extent of the task which you are imposing on him; and if there were more of us I should not ask him, for these are not subjects which any one, especially at his age, can well speak of before a large audience; most people are not aware that this roundabout progress through all things is the only way in which the mind can attain truth and wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore, Parmenides, I join in the request of Socrates, that I may hear the process again which I have not heard for a long time.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">139</span> <div class="sentence">  When Zeno had thus spoken, Pythodorus, according to Antiphon's report of him, said, that he himself and Aristoteles and the whole company entreated Parmenides to give an example of the process.</div><div class="sentence"> I cannot refuse, said Parmenides; and yet I feel rather like Ibycus, who, when in his old age, against his will, he fell in love, compared himself to an old racehorse, who was about to run in a chariot race, shaking with fear at the course he knew so well—this was his simile of himself.</div><div class="sentence"> And I also experience a trembling when I remember through what an ocean of words I have to wade at my time of life.</div><div class="sentence"> But I must indulge you, as Zeno says that I ought, and we are alone.</div><div class="sentence"> Where shall I begin?</div><div class="sentence"> And what shall be our first hypothesis, if I am to attempt this laborious pastime?</div><div class="sentence"> Shall I begin with myself, and take my own hypothesis the one?</div><div class="sentence"> and consider the consequences which follow on the supposition either of the being or of the not-being of one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">140</span> <div class="sentence">  By all means, said Zeno.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">141</span> <div class="sentence">  And who will answer me?</div><div class="sentence"> he said.</div><div class="sentence"> Shall I propose the youngest?</div><div class="sentence"> He will not make difficulties and will be the most likely to say what he thinks; and his answers will give me time to breathe.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">142</span> <div class="sentence">  I am the one whom you mean, Parmenides, said Aristoteles; for I am the youngest and at your service.</div><div class="sentence"> Ask, and I will answer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">143</span> <div class="sentence">  Parmenides proceeded: 1.a.</div><div class="sentence"> If one is, he said, the one cannot be many?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">144</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">145</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one cannot have parts, and cannot be a whole?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">146</span> <div class="sentence">  Why not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">147</span> <div class="sentence">  Because every part is part of a whole; is it not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">148</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">149</span> <div class="sentence">  And what is a whole?</div><div class="sentence"> would not that of which no part is wanting be a whole?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">150</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">151</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, in either case, the one would be made up of parts; both as being a whole, and also as having parts?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">152</span> <div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">153</span> <div class="sentence">  And in either case, the one would be many, and not one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">154</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">155</span> <div class="sentence">  But, surely, it ought to be one and not many?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">156</span> <div class="sentence">  It ought.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">157</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, if the one is to remain one, it will not be a whole, and will not have parts?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">158</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">159</span> <div class="sentence">  But if it has no parts, it will have neither beginning, middle, nor end; for these would of course be parts of it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">160</span> <div class="sentence">  Right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">161</span> <div class="sentence">  But then, again, a beginning and an end are the limits of everything?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">162</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">163</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one, having neither beginning nor end, is unlimited?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">164</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, unlimited.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">165</span> <div class="sentence">  And therefore formless; for it cannot partake either of round or straight.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">166</span> <div class="sentence">  But why?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">167</span> <div class="sentence">  Why, because the round is that of which all the extreme points are equidistant from the centre?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">168</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">169</span> <div class="sentence">  And the straight is that of which the centre intercepts the view of the extremes?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">170</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">171</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one would have parts and would be many, if it partook either of a straight or of a circular form?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">172</span> <div class="sentence">  Assuredly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">173</span> <div class="sentence">  But having no parts, it will be neither straight nor round?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">174</span> <div class="sentence">  Right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">175</span> <div class="sentence">  And, being of such a nature, it cannot be in any place, for it cannot be either in another or in itself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">176</span> <div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">177</span> <div class="sentence">  Because if it were in another, it would be encircled by that in which it was, and would touch it at many places and with many parts; but that which is one and indivisible, and does not partake of a circular nature, cannot be touched all round in many places.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">178</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">179</span> <div class="sentence">  But if, on the other hand, one were in itself, it would also be contained by nothing else but itself; that is to say, if it were really in itself; for nothing can be in anything which does not contain it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">180</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">181</span> <div class="sentence">  But then, that which contains must be other than that which is contained?</div><div class="sentence"> for the same whole cannot do and suffer both at once; and if so, one will be no longer one, but two?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">182</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">183</span> <div class="sentence">  Then one cannot be anywhere, either in itself or in another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">184</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">185</span> <div class="sentence">  Further consider, whether that which is of such a nature can have either rest or motion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">186</span> <div class="sentence">  Why not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">187</span> <div class="sentence">  Why, because the one, if it were moved, would be either moved in place or changed in nature; for these are the only kinds of motion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">188</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">189</span> <div class="sentence">  And the one, when it changes and ceases to be itself, cannot be any longer one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">190</span> <div class="sentence">  It cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">191</span> <div class="sentence">  It cannot therefore experience the sort of motion which is change of nature?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">192</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">193</span> <div class="sentence">  Then can the motion of the one be in place?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">194</span> <div class="sentence">  Perhaps.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">195</span> <div class="sentence">  But if the one moved in place, must it not either move round and round in the same place, or from one place to another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">196</span> <div class="sentence">  It must.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">197</span> <div class="sentence">  And that which moves in a circle must rest upon a centre; and that which goes round upon a centre must have parts which are different from the centre; but that which has no centre and no parts cannot possibly be carried round upon a centre?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">198</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">199</span> <div class="sentence">  But perhaps the motion of the one consists in change of place?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">200</span> <div class="sentence">  Perhaps so, if it moves at all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">201</span> <div class="sentence">  And have we not already shown that it cannot be in anything?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">202</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">203</span> <div class="sentence">  Then its coming into being in anything is still more impossible; is it not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">204</span> <div class="sentence">  I do not see why.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">205</span> <div class="sentence">  Why, because anything which comes into being in anything, can neither as yet be in that other thing while still coming into being, nor be altogether out of it, if already coming into being in it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">206</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">207</span> <div class="sentence">  And therefore whatever comes into being in another must have parts, and then one part may be in, and another part out of that other; but that which has no parts can never be at one and the same time neither wholly within nor wholly without anything.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">208</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">209</span> <div class="sentence">  And is there not a still greater impossibility in that which has no parts, and is not a whole, coming into being anywhere, since it cannot come into being either as a part or as a whole?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">210</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">211</span> <div class="sentence">  Then it does not change place by revolving in the same spot, nor by going somewhere and coming into being in something; nor again, by change in itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">212</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">213</span> <div class="sentence">  Then in respect of any kind of motion the one is immoveable?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">214</span> <div class="sentence">  Immoveable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">215</span> <div class="sentence">  But neither can the one be in anything, as we affirm?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">216</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, we said so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">217</span> <div class="sentence">  Then it is never in the same?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">218</span> <div class="sentence">  Why not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">219</span> <div class="sentence">  Because if it were in the same it would be in something.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">220</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">221</span> <div class="sentence">  And we said that it could not be in itself, and could not be in other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">222</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">223</span> <div class="sentence">  Then one is never in the same place?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">224</span> <div class="sentence">  It would seem not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">225</span> <div class="sentence">  But that which is never in the same place is never quiet or at rest?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">226</span> <div class="sentence">  Never.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">227</span> <div class="sentence">  One then, as would seem, is neither at rest nor in motion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">228</span> <div class="sentence">  It certainly appears so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">229</span> <div class="sentence">  Neither will it be the same with itself or other; nor again, other than itself or other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">230</span> <div class="sentence">  How is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">231</span> <div class="sentence">  If other than itself it would be other than one, and would not be one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">232</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">233</span> <div class="sentence">  And if the same with other, it would be that other, and not itself; so that upon this supposition too, it would not have the nature of one, but would be other than one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">234</span> <div class="sentence">  It would.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">235</span> <div class="sentence">  Then it will not be the same with other, or other than itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">236</span> <div class="sentence">  It will not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">237</span> <div class="sentence">  Neither will it be other than other, while it remains one; for not one, but only other, can be other than other, and nothing else.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">238</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">239</span> <div class="sentence">  Then not by virtue of being one will it be other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">240</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">241</span> <div class="sentence">  But if not by virtue of being one, not by virtue of itself; and if not by virtue of itself, not itself, and itself not being other at all, will not be other than anything?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">242</span> <div class="sentence">  Right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">243</span> <div class="sentence">  Neither will one be the same with itself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">244</span> <div class="sentence">  How not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">245</span> <div class="sentence">  Surely the nature of the one is not the nature of the same.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">246</span> <div class="sentence">  Why not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">247</span> <div class="sentence">  It is not when anything becomes the same with anything that it becomes one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">248</span> <div class="sentence">  What of that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">249</span> <div class="sentence">  Anything which becomes the same with the many, necessarily becomes many and not one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">250</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">251</span> <div class="sentence">  But, if there were no difference between the one and the same, when a thing became the same, it would always become one; and when it became one, the same?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">252</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">253</span> <div class="sentence">  And, therefore, if one be the same with itself, it is not one with itself, and will therefore be one and also not one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">254</span> <div class="sentence">  Surely that is impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">255</span> <div class="sentence">  And therefore the one can neither be other than other, nor the same with itself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">256</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">257</span> <div class="sentence">  And thus the one can neither be the same, nor other, either in relation to itself or other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">258</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">259</span> <div class="sentence">  Neither will the one be like anything or unlike itself or other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">260</span> <div class="sentence">  Why not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">261</span> <div class="sentence">  Because likeness is sameness of affections.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">262</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">263</span> <div class="sentence">  And sameness has been shown to be of a nature distinct from oneness?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">264</span> <div class="sentence">  That has been shown.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">265</span> <div class="sentence">  But if the one had any other affection than that of being one, it would be affected in such a way as to be more than one; which is impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">266</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">267</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one can never be so affected as to be the same either with another or with itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">268</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">269</span> <div class="sentence">  Then it cannot be like another, or like itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">270</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">271</span> <div class="sentence">  Nor can it be affected so as to be other, for then it would be affected in such a way as to be more than one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">272</span> <div class="sentence">  It would.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">273</span> <div class="sentence">  That which is affected otherwise than itself or another, will be unlike itself or another, for sameness of affections is likeness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">274</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">275</span> <div class="sentence">  But the one, as appears, never being affected otherwise, is never unlike itself or other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">276</span> <div class="sentence">  Never.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">277</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one will never be either like or unlike itself or other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">278</span> <div class="sentence">  Plainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">279</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, being of this nature, it can neither be equal nor unequal either to itself or to other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">280</span> <div class="sentence">  How is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">281</span> <div class="sentence">  Why, because the one if equal must be of the same measures as that to which it is equal.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">282</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">283</span> <div class="sentence">  And if greater or less than things which are commensurable with it, the one will have more measures than that which is less, and fewer than that which is greater?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">284</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">285</span> <div class="sentence">  And so of things which are not commensurate with it, the one will have greater measures than that which is less and smaller than that which is greater.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">286</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">287</span> <div class="sentence">  But how can that which does not partake of sameness, have either the same measures or have anything else the same?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">288</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">289</span> <div class="sentence">  And not having the same measures, the one cannot be equal either with itself or with another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">290</span> <div class="sentence">  It appears so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">291</span> <div class="sentence">  But again, whether it have fewer or more measures, it will have as many parts as it has measures; and thus again the one will be no longer one but will have as many parts as measures.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">292</span> <div class="sentence">  Right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">293</span> <div class="sentence">  And if it were of one measure, it would be equal to that measure; yet it has been shown to be incapable of equality.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">294</span> <div class="sentence">  It has.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">295</span> <div class="sentence">  Then it will neither partake of one measure, nor of many, nor of few, nor of the same at all, nor be equal to itself or another; nor be greater or less than itself, or other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">296</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">297</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, and do we suppose that one can be older, or younger than anything, or of the same age with it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">298</span> <div class="sentence">  Why not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">299</span> <div class="sentence">  Why, because that which is of the same age with itself or other, must partake of equality or likeness of time; and we said that the one did not partake either of equality or of likeness?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">300</span> <div class="sentence">  We did say so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">301</span> <div class="sentence">  And we also said, that it did not partake of inequality or unlikeness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">302</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">303</span> <div class="sentence">  How then can one, being of this nature, be either older or younger than anything, or have the same age with it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">304</span> <div class="sentence">  In no way.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">305</span> <div class="sentence">  Then one cannot be older or younger, or of the same age, either with itself or with another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">306</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">307</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one, being of this nature, cannot be in time at all; for must not that which is in time, be always growing older than itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">308</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">309</span> <div class="sentence">  And that which is older, must always be older than something which is younger?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">310</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">311</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, that which becomes older than itself, also becomes at the same time younger than itself, if it is to have something to become older than.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">312</span> <div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">313</span> <div class="sentence">  I mean this:—A thing does not need to become different from another thing which is already different; it IS different, and if its different has become, it has become different; if its different will be, it will be different; but of that which is becoming different, there cannot have been, or be about to be, or yet be, a different—the only different possible is one which is becoming.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">314</span> <div class="sentence">  That is inevitable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">315</span> <div class="sentence">  But, surely, the elder is a difference relative to the younger, and to nothing else.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">316</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">317</span> <div class="sentence">  Then that which becomes older than itself must also, at the same time, become younger than itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">318</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">319</span> <div class="sentence">  But again, it is true that it cannot become for a longer or for a shorter time than itself, but it must become, and be, and have become, and be about to be, for the same time with itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">320</span> <div class="sentence">  That again is inevitable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">321</span> <div class="sentence">  Then things which are in time, and partake of time, must in every case, I suppose, be of the same age with themselves; and must also become at once older and younger than themselves?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">322</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">323</span> <div class="sentence">  But the one did not partake of those affections?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">324</span> <div class="sentence">  Not at all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">325</span> <div class="sentence">  Then it does not partake of time, and is not in any time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">326</span> <div class="sentence">  So the argument shows.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">327</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, but do not the expressions 'was,' and 'has become,' and 'was becoming,' signify a participation of past time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">328</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">329</span> <div class="sentence">  And do not 'will be,' 'will become,' 'will have become,' signify a participation of future time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">330</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">331</span> <div class="sentence">  And 'is,' or 'becomes,' signifies a participation of present time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">332</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">333</span> <div class="sentence">  And if the one is absolutely without participation in time, it never had become, or was becoming, or was at any time, or is now become or is becoming, or is, or will become, or will have become, or will be, hereafter.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">334</span> <div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">335</span> <div class="sentence">  But are there any modes of partaking of being other than these?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">336</span> <div class="sentence">  There are none.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">337</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one cannot possibly partake of being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">338</span> <div class="sentence">  That is the inference.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">339</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one is not at all?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">340</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">341</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one does not exist in such way as to be one; for if it were and partook of being, it would already be; but if the argument is to be trusted, the one neither is nor is one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">342</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">343</span> <div class="sentence">  But that which is not admits of no attribute or relation?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">344</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">345</span> <div class="sentence">  Then there is no name, nor expression, nor perception, nor opinion, nor knowledge of it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">346</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">347</span> <div class="sentence">  Then it is neither named, nor expressed, nor opined, nor known, nor does anything that is perceive it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">348</span> <div class="sentence">  So we must infer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">349</span> <div class="sentence">  But can all this be true about the one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">350</span> <div class="sentence">  I think not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">351</span> <div class="sentence">  1.b.</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose, now, that we return once more to the original hypothesis; let us see whether, on a further review, any new aspect of the question appears.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">352</span> <div class="sentence">  I shall be very happy to do so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">353</span> <div class="sentence">  We say that we have to work out together all the consequences, whatever they may be, which follow, if the one is?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">354</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">355</span> <div class="sentence">  Then we will begin at the beginning:—If one is, can one be, and not partake of being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">356</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">357</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one will have being, but its being will not be the same with the one; for if the same, it would not be the being of the one; nor would the one have participated in being, for the proposition that one is would have been identical with the proposition that one is one; but our hypothesis is not if one is one, what will follow, but if one is:—am I not right?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">358</span> <div class="sentence">  Quite right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">359</span> <div class="sentence">  We mean to say, that being has not the same significance as one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">360</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">361</span> <div class="sentence">  And when we put them together shortly, and say 'One is,' that is equivalent to saying, 'partakes of being'?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">362</span> <div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">363</span> <div class="sentence">  Once more then let us ask, if one is what will follow.</div><div class="sentence"> Does not this hypothesis necessarily imply that one is of such a nature as to have parts?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">364</span> <div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">365</span> <div class="sentence">  In this way:—If being is predicated of the one, if the one is, and one of being, if being is one; and if being and one are not the same; and since the one, which we have assumed, is, must not the whole, if it is one, itself be, and have for its parts, one and being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">366</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">367</span> <div class="sentence">  And is each of these parts—one and being—to be simply called a part, or must the word 'part' be relative to the word 'whole'?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">368</span> <div class="sentence">  The latter.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">369</span> <div class="sentence">  Then that which is one is both a whole and has a part?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">370</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">371</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, of the parts of the one, if it is—I mean being and one—does either fail to imply the other?</div><div class="sentence"> is the one wanting to being, or being to the one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">372</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">373</span> <div class="sentence">  Thus, each of the parts also has in turn both one and being, and is at the least made up of two parts; and the same principle goes on for ever, and every part whatever has always these two parts; for being always involves one, and one being; so that one is always disappearing, and becoming two.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">374</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">375</span> <div class="sentence">  And so the one, if it is, must be infinite in multiplicity?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">376</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">377</span> <div class="sentence">  Let us take another direction.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">378</span> <div class="sentence">  What direction?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">379</span> <div class="sentence">  We say that the one partakes of being and therefore it is?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">380</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">381</span> <div class="sentence">  And in this way, the one, if it has being, has turned out to be many?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">382</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">383</span> <div class="sentence">  But now, let us abstract the one which, as we say, partakes of being, and try to imagine it apart from that of which, as we say, it partakes—will this abstract one be one only or many?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">384</span> <div class="sentence">  One, I think.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">385</span> <div class="sentence">  Let us see:—Must not the being of one be other than one?</div><div class="sentence"> for the one is not being, but, considered as one, only partook of being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">386</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">387</span> <div class="sentence">  If being and the one be two different things, it is not because the one is one that it is other than being; nor because being is being that it is other than the one; but they differ from one another in virtue of otherness and difference.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">388</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">389</span> <div class="sentence">  So that the other is not the same—either with the one or with being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">390</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">391</span> <div class="sentence">  And therefore whether we take being and the other, or being and the one, or the one and the other, in every such case we take two things, which may be rightly called both.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">392</span> <div class="sentence">  How so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">393</span> <div class="sentence">  In this way—you may speak of being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">394</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">395</span> <div class="sentence">  And also of one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">396</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">397</span> <div class="sentence">  Then now we have spoken of either of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">398</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">399</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, and when I speak of being and one, I speak of them both?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">400</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">401</span> <div class="sentence">  And if I speak of being and the other, or of the one and the other,—in any such case do I not speak of both?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">402</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">403</span> <div class="sentence">  And must not that which is correctly called both, be also two?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">404</span> <div class="sentence">  Undoubtedly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">405</span> <div class="sentence">  And of two things how can either by any possibility not be one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">406</span> <div class="sentence">  It cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">407</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, if the individuals of the pair are together two, they must be severally one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">408</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">409</span> <div class="sentence">  And if each of them is one, then by the addition of any one to any pair, the whole becomes three?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">410</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">411</span> <div class="sentence">  And three are odd, and two are even?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">412</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">413</span> <div class="sentence">  And if there are two there must also be twice, and if there are three there must be thrice; that is, if twice one makes two, and thrice one three?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">414</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">415</span> <div class="sentence">  There are two, and twice, and therefore there must be twice two; and there are three, and there is thrice, and therefore there must be thrice three?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">416</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">417</span> <div class="sentence">  If there are three and twice, there is twice three; and if there are two and thrice, there is thrice two?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">418</span> <div class="sentence">  Undoubtedly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">419</span> <div class="sentence">  Here, then, we have even taken even times, and odd taken odd times, and even taken odd times, and odd taken even times.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">420</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">421</span> <div class="sentence">  And if this is so, does any number remain which has no necessity to be?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">422</span> <div class="sentence">  None whatever.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">423</span> <div class="sentence">  Then if one is, number must also be?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">424</span> <div class="sentence">  It must.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">425</span> <div class="sentence">  But if there is number, there must also be many, and infinite multiplicity of being; for number is infinite in multiplicity, and partakes also of being: am I not right?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">426</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">427</span> <div class="sentence">  And if all number participates in being, every part of number will also participate?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">428</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">429</span> <div class="sentence">  Then being is distributed over the whole multitude of things, and nothing that is, however small or however great, is devoid of it?</div><div class="sentence"> And, indeed, the very supposition of this is absurd, for how can that which is, be devoid of being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">430</span> <div class="sentence">  In no way.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">431</span> <div class="sentence">  And it is divided into the greatest and into the smallest, and into being of all sizes, and is broken up more than all things; the divisions of it have no limit.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">432</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">433</span> <div class="sentence">  Then it has the greatest number of parts?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">434</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, the greatest number.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">435</span> <div class="sentence">  Is there any of these which is a part of being, and yet no part?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">436</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">437</span> <div class="sentence">  But if it is at all and so long as it is, it must be one, and cannot be none?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">438</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">439</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one attaches to every single part of being, and does not fail in any part, whether great or small, or whatever may be the size of it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">440</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">441</span> <div class="sentence">  But reflect:—Can one, in its entirety, be in many places at the same time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">442</span> <div class="sentence">  No; I see the impossibility of that.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">443</span> <div class="sentence">  And if not in its entirety, then it is divided; for it cannot be present with all the parts of being, unless divided.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">444</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">445</span> <div class="sentence">  And that which has parts will be as many as the parts are?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">446</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">447</span> <div class="sentence">  Then we were wrong in saying just now, that being was distributed into the greatest number of parts.</div><div class="sentence"> For it is not distributed into parts more than the one, into parts equal to the one; the one is never wanting to being, or being to the one, but being two they are co-equal and co-extensive.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">448</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly that is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">449</span> <div class="sentence">  The one itself, then, having been broken up into parts by being, is many and infinite?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">450</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">451</span> <div class="sentence">  Then not only the one which has being is many, but the one itself distributed by being, must also be many?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">452</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">453</span> <div class="sentence">  Further, inasmuch as the parts are parts of a whole, the one, as a whole, will be limited; for are not the parts contained by the whole?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">454</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">455</span> <div class="sentence">  And that which contains, is a limit?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">456</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">457</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one if it has being is one and many, whole and parts, having limits and yet unlimited in number?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">458</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">459</span> <div class="sentence">  And because having limits, also having extremes?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">460</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">461</span> <div class="sentence">  And if a whole, having beginning and middle and end.</div><div class="sentence"> For can anything be a whole without these three?</div><div class="sentence"> And if any one of them is wanting to anything, will that any longer be a whole?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">462</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">463</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one, as appears, will have beginning, middle, and end.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">464</span> <div class="sentence">  It will.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">465</span> <div class="sentence">  But, again, the middle will be equidistant from the extremes; or it would not be in the middle?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">466</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">467</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one will partake of figure, either rectilinear or round, or a union of the two?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">468</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">469</span> <div class="sentence">  And if this is the case, it will be both in itself and in another too.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">470</span> <div class="sentence">  How?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">471</span> <div class="sentence">  Every part is in the whole, and none is outside the whole.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">472</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">473</span> <div class="sentence">  And all the parts are contained by the whole?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">474</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">475</span> <div class="sentence">  And the one is all its parts, and neither more nor less than all?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">476</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">477</span> <div class="sentence">  And the one is the whole?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">478</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">479</span> <div class="sentence">  But if all the parts are in the whole, and the one is all of them and the whole, and they are all contained by the whole, the one will be contained by the one; and thus the one will be in itself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">480</span> <div class="sentence">  That is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">481</span> <div class="sentence">  But then, again, the whole is not in the parts—neither in all the parts, nor in some one of them.</div><div class="sentence"> For if it is in all, it must be in one; for if there were any one in which it was not, it could not be in all the parts; for the part in which it is wanting is one of all, and if the whole is not in this, how can it be in them all?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">482</span> <div class="sentence">  It cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">483</span> <div class="sentence">  Nor can the whole be in some of the parts; for if the whole were in some of the parts, the greater would be in the less, which is impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">484</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">485</span> <div class="sentence">  But if the whole is neither in one, nor in more than one, nor in all of the parts, it must be in something else, or cease to be anywhere at all?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">486</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">487</span> <div class="sentence">  If it were nowhere, it would be nothing; but being a whole, and not being in itself, it must be in another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">488</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">489</span> <div class="sentence">  The one then, regarded as a whole, is in another, but regarded as being all its parts, is in itself; and therefore the one must be itself in itself and also in another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">490</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">491</span> <div class="sentence">  The one then, being of this nature, is of necessity both at rest and in motion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">492</span> <div class="sentence">  How?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">493</span> <div class="sentence">  The one is at rest since it is in itself, for being in one, and not passing out of this, it is in the same, which is itself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">494</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">495</span> <div class="sentence">  And that which is ever in the same, must be ever at rest?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">496</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">497</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, and must not that, on the contrary, which is ever in other, never be in the same; and if never in the same, never at rest, and if not at rest, in motion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">498</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">499</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one being always itself in itself and other, must always be both at rest and in motion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">500</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">501</span> <div class="sentence">  And must be the same with itself, and other than itself; and also the same with the others, and other than the others; this follows from its previous affections.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">502</span> <div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">503</span> <div class="sentence">  Everything in relation to every other thing, is either the same or other; or if neither the same nor other, then in the relation of a part to a whole, or of a whole to a part.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">504</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">505</span> <div class="sentence">  And is the one a part of itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">506</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">507</span> <div class="sentence">  Since it is not a part in relation to itself it cannot be related to itself as whole to part?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">508</span> <div class="sentence">  It cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">509</span> <div class="sentence">  But is the one other than one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">510</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">511</span> <div class="sentence">  And therefore not other than itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">512</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">513</span> <div class="sentence">  If then it be neither other, nor a whole, nor a part in relation to itself, must it not be the same with itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">514</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">515</span> <div class="sentence">  But then, again, a thing which is in another place from 'itself,' if this 'itself' remains in the same place with itself, must be other than 'itself,' for it will be in another place?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">516</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">517</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one has been shown to be at once in itself and in another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">518</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">519</span> <div class="sentence">  Thus, then, as appears, the one will be other than itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">520</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">521</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, then, if anything be other than anything, will it not be other than that which is other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">522</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">523</span> <div class="sentence">  And will not all things that are not one, be other than the one, and the one other than the not-one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">524</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">525</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one will be other than the others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">526</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">527</span> <div class="sentence">  But, consider:—Are not the absolute same, and the absolute other, opposites to one another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">528</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">529</span> <div class="sentence">  Then will the same ever be in the other, or the other in the same?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">530</span> <div class="sentence">  They will not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">531</span> <div class="sentence">  If then the other is never in the same, there is nothing in which the other is during any space of time; for during that space of time, however small, the other would be in the same.</div><div class="sentence"> Is not that true?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">532</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">533</span> <div class="sentence">  And since the other is never in the same, it can never be in anything that is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">534</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">535</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the other will never be either in the not-one, or in the one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">536</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">537</span> <div class="sentence">  Then not by reason of otherness is the one other than the not-one, or the not-one other than the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">538</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">539</span> <div class="sentence">  Nor by reason of themselves will they be other than one another, if not partaking of the other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">540</span> <div class="sentence">  How can they be?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">541</span> <div class="sentence">  But if they are not other, either by reason of themselves or of the other, will they not altogether escape being other than one another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">542</span> <div class="sentence">  They will.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">543</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, the not-one cannot partake of the one; otherwise it would not have been not-one, but would have been in some way one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">544</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">545</span> <div class="sentence">  Nor can the not-one be number; for having number, it would not have been not-one at all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">546</span> <div class="sentence">  It would not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">547</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, is the not-one part of the one; or rather, would it not in that case partake of the one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">548</span> <div class="sentence">  It would.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">549</span> <div class="sentence">  If then, in every point of view, the one and the not-one are distinct, then neither is the one part or whole of the not-one, nor is the not-one part or whole of the one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">550</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">551</span> <div class="sentence">  But we said that things which are neither parts nor wholes of one another, nor other than one another, will be the same with one another:—so we said?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">552</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">553</span> <div class="sentence">  Then shall we say that the one, being in this relation to the not-one, is the same with it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">554</span> <div class="sentence">  Let us say so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">555</span> <div class="sentence">  Then it is the same with itself and the others, and also other than itself and the others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">556</span> <div class="sentence">  That appears to be the inference.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">557</span> <div class="sentence">  And it will also be like and unlike itself and the others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">558</span> <div class="sentence">  Perhaps.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">559</span> <div class="sentence">  Since the one was shown to be other than the others, the others will also be other than the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">560</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">561</span> <div class="sentence">  And the one is other than the others in the same degree that the others are other than it, and neither more nor less?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">562</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">563</span> <div class="sentence">  And if neither more nor less, then in a like degree?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">564</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">565</span> <div class="sentence">  In virtue of the affection by which the one is other than others and others in like manner other than it, the one will be affected like the others and the others like the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">566</span> <div class="sentence">  How do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">567</span> <div class="sentence">  I may take as an illustration the case of names: You give a name to a thing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">568</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">569</span> <div class="sentence">  And you may say the name once or oftener?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">570</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">571</span> <div class="sentence">  And when you say it once, you mention that of which it is the name?</div><div class="sentence"> and when more than once, is it something else which you mention?</div><div class="sentence"> or must it always be the same thing of which you speak, whether you utter the name once or more than once?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">572</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course it is the same.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">573</span> <div class="sentence">  And is not 'other' a name given to a thing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">574</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">575</span> <div class="sentence">  Whenever, then, you use the word 'other,' whether once or oftener, you name that of which it is the name, and to no other do you give the name?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">576</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">577</span> <div class="sentence">  Then when we say that the others are other than the one, and the one other than the others, in repeating the word 'other' we speak of that nature to which the name is applied, and of no other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">578</span> <div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">579</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one which is other than others, and the other which is other than the one, in that the word 'other' is applied to both, will be in the same condition; and that which is in the same condition is like?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">580</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">581</span> <div class="sentence">  Then in virtue of the affection by which the one is other than the others, every thing will be like every thing, for every thing is other than every thing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">582</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">583</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, the like is opposed to the unlike?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">584</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">585</span> <div class="sentence">  And the other to the same?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">586</span> <div class="sentence">  True again.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">587</span> <div class="sentence">  And the one was also shown to be the same with the others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">588</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">589</span> <div class="sentence">  And to be the same with the others is the opposite of being other than the others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">590</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">591</span> <div class="sentence">  And in that it was other it was shown to be like?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">592</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">593</span> <div class="sentence">  But in that it was the same it will be unlike by virtue of the opposite affection to that which made it like; and this was the affection of otherness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">594</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">595</span> <div class="sentence">  The same then will make it unlike; otherwise it will not be the opposite of the other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">596</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">597</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one will be both like and unlike the others; like in so far as it is other, and unlike in so far as it is the same.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">598</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, that argument may be used.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">599</span> <div class="sentence">  And there is another argument.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">600</span> <div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">601</span> <div class="sentence">  In so far as it is affected in the same way it is not affected otherwise, and not being affected otherwise is not unlike, and not being unlike, is like; but in so far as it is affected by other it is otherwise, and being otherwise affected is unlike.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">602</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">603</span> <div class="sentence">  Then because the one is the same with the others and other than the others, on either of these two grounds, or on both of them, it will be both like and unlike the others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">604</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">605</span> <div class="sentence">  And in the same way as being other than itself and the same with itself, on either of these two grounds and on both of them, it will be like and unlike itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">606</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">607</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, how far can the one touch or not touch itself and others?—consider.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">608</span> <div class="sentence">  I am considering.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">609</span> <div class="sentence">  The one was shown to be in itself which was a whole?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">610</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">611</span> <div class="sentence">  And also in other things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">612</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">613</span> <div class="sentence">  In so far as it is in other things it would touch other things, but in so far as it is in itself it would be debarred from touching them, and would touch itself only.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">614</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">615</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the inference is that it would touch both?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">616</span> <div class="sentence">  It would.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">617</span> <div class="sentence">  But what do you say to a new point of view?</div><div class="sentence"> Must not that which is to touch another be next to that which it is to touch, and occupy the place nearest to that in which what it touches is situated?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">618</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">619</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one, if it is to touch itself, ought to be situated next to itself, and occupy the place next to that in which itself is?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">620</span> <div class="sentence">  It ought.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">621</span> <div class="sentence">  And that would require that the one should be two, and be in two places at once, and this, while it is one, will never happen.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">622</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">623</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one cannot touch itself any more than it can be two?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">624</span> <div class="sentence">  It cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">625</span> <div class="sentence">  Neither can it touch others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">626</span> <div class="sentence">  Why not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">627</span> <div class="sentence">  The reason is, that whatever is to touch another must be in separation from, and next to, that which it is to touch, and no third thing can be between them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">628</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">629</span> <div class="sentence">  Two things, then, at the least are necessary to make contact possible?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">630</span> <div class="sentence">  They are.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">631</span> <div class="sentence">  And if to the two a third be added in due order, the number of terms will be three, and the contacts two?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">632</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">633</span> <div class="sentence">  And every additional term makes one additional contact, whence it follows that the contacts are one less in number than the terms; the first two terms exceeded the number of contacts by one, and the whole number of terms exceeds the whole number of contacts by one in like manner; and for every one which is afterwards added to the number of terms, one contact is added to the contacts.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">634</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">635</span> <div class="sentence">  Whatever is the whole number of things, the contacts will be always one less.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">636</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">637</span> <div class="sentence">  But if there be only one, and not two, there will be no contact?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">638</span> <div class="sentence">  How can there be?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">639</span> <div class="sentence">  And do we not say that the others being other than the one are not one and have no part in the one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">640</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">641</span> <div class="sentence">  Then they have no number, if they have no one in them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">642</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">643</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the others are neither one nor two, nor are they called by the name of any number?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">644</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">645</span> <div class="sentence">  One, then, alone is one, and two do not exist?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">646</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">647</span> <div class="sentence">  And if there are not two, there is no contact?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">648</span> <div class="sentence">  There is not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">649</span> <div class="sentence">  Then neither does the one touch the others, nor the others the one, if there is no contact?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">650</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">651</span> <div class="sentence">  For all which reasons the one touches and does not touch itself and the others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">652</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">653</span> <div class="sentence">  Further—is the one equal and unequal to itself and others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">654</span> <div class="sentence">  How do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">655</span> <div class="sentence">  If the one were greater or less than the others, or the others greater or less than the one, they would not be greater or less than each other in virtue of their being the one and the others; but, if in addition to their being what they are they had equality, they would be equal to one another, or if the one had smallness and the others greatness, or the one had greatness and the others smallness—whichever kind had greatness would be greater, and whichever had smallness would be smaller?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">656</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">657</span> <div class="sentence">  Then there are two such ideas as greatness and smallness; for if they were not they could not be opposed to each other and be present in that which is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">658</span> <div class="sentence">  How could they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">659</span> <div class="sentence">  If, then, smallness is present in the one it will be present either in the whole or in a part of the whole?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">660</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">661</span> <div class="sentence">  Suppose the first; it will be either co-equal and co-extensive with the whole one, or will contain the one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">662</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">663</span> <div class="sentence">  If it be co-extensive with the one it will be co-equal with the one, or if containing the one it will be greater than the one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">664</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">665</span> <div class="sentence">  But can smallness be equal to anything or greater than anything, and have the functions of greatness and equality and not its own functions?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">666</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">667</span> <div class="sentence">  Then smallness cannot be in the whole of one, but, if at all, in a part only?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">668</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">669</span> <div class="sentence">  And surely not in all of a part, for then the difficulty of the whole will recur; it will be equal to or greater than any part in which it is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">670</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">671</span> <div class="sentence">  Then smallness will not be in anything, whether in a whole or in a part; nor will there be anything small but actual smallness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">672</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">673</span> <div class="sentence">  Neither will greatness be in the one, for if greatness be in anything there will be something greater other and besides greatness itself, namely, that in which greatness is; and this too when the small itself is not there, which the one, if it is great, must exceed; this, however, is impossible, seeing that smallness is wholly absent.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">674</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">675</span> <div class="sentence">  But absolute greatness is only greater than absolute smallness, and smallness is only smaller than absolute greatness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">676</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">677</span> <div class="sentence">  Then other things not greater or less than the one, if they have neither greatness nor smallness; nor have greatness or smallness any power of exceeding or being exceeded in relation to the one, but only in relation to one another; nor will the one be greater or less than them or others, if it has neither greatness nor smallness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">678</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">679</span> <div class="sentence">  Then if the one is neither greater nor less than the others, it cannot either exceed or be exceeded by them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">680</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">681</span> <div class="sentence">  And that which neither exceeds nor is exceeded, must be on an equality; and being on an equality, must be equal.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">682</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">683</span> <div class="sentence">  And this will be true also of the relation of the one to itself; having neither greatness nor smallness in itself, it will neither exceed nor be exceeded by itself, but will be on an equality with and equal to itself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">684</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">685</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one will be equal both to itself and the others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">686</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">687</span> <div class="sentence">  And yet the one, being itself in itself, will also surround and be without itself; and, as containing itself, will be greater than itself; and, as contained in itself, will be less; and will thus be greater and less than itself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">688</span> <div class="sentence">  It will.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">689</span> <div class="sentence">  Now there cannot possibly be anything which is not included in the one and the others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">690</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">691</span> <div class="sentence">  But, surely, that which is must always be somewhere?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">692</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">693</span> <div class="sentence">  But that which is in anything will be less, and that in which it is will be greater; in no other way can one thing be in another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">694</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">695</span> <div class="sentence">  And since there is nothing other or besides the one and the others, and they must be in something, must they not be in one another, the one in the others and the others in the one, if they are to be anywhere?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">696</span> <div class="sentence">  That is clear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">697</span> <div class="sentence">  But inasmuch as the one is in the others, the others will be greater than the one, because they contain the one, which will be less than the others, because it is contained in them; and inasmuch as the others are in the one, the one on the same principle will be greater than the others, and the others less than the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">698</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">699</span> <div class="sentence">  The one, then, will be equal to and greater and less than itself and the others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">700</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">701</span> <div class="sentence">  And if it be greater and less and equal, it will be of equal and more and less measures or divisions than itself and the others, and if of measures, also of parts?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">702</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">703</span> <div class="sentence">  And if of equal and more and less measures or divisions, it will be in number more or less than itself and the others, and likewise equal in number to itself and to the others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">704</span> <div class="sentence">  How is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">705</span> <div class="sentence">  It will be of more measures than those things which it exceeds, and of as many parts as measures; and so with that to which it is equal, and that than which it is less.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">706</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">707</span> <div class="sentence">  And being greater and less than itself, and equal to itself, it will be of equal measures with itself and of more and fewer measures than itself; and if of measures then also of parts?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">708</span> <div class="sentence">  It will.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">709</span> <div class="sentence">  And being of equal parts with itself, it will be numerically equal to itself; and being of more parts, more, and being of less, less than itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">710</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">711</span> <div class="sentence">  And the same will hold of its relation to other things; inasmuch as it is greater than them, it will be more in number than them; and inasmuch as it is smaller, it will be less in number; and inasmuch as it is equal in size to other things, it will be equal to them in number.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">712</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">713</span> <div class="sentence">  Once more, then, as would appear, the one will be in number both equal to and more and less than both itself and all other things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">714</span> <div class="sentence">  It will.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">715</span> <div class="sentence">  Does the one also partake of time?</div><div class="sentence"> And is it and does it become older and younger than itself and others, and again, neither younger nor older than itself and others, by virtue of participation in time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">716</span> <div class="sentence">  How do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">717</span> <div class="sentence">  If one is, being must be predicated of it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">718</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">719</span> <div class="sentence">  But to be (einai) is only participation of being in present time, and to have been is the participation of being at a past time, and to be about to be is the participation of being at a future time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">720</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">721</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one, since it partakes of being, partakes of time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">722</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">723</span> <div class="sentence">  And is not time always moving forward?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">724</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">725</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one is always becoming older than itself, since it moves forward in time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">726</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">727</span> <div class="sentence">  And do you remember that the older becomes older than that which becomes younger?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">728</span> <div class="sentence">  I remember.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">729</span> <div class="sentence">  Then since the one becomes older than itself, it becomes younger at the same time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">730</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">731</span> <div class="sentence">  Thus, then, the one becomes older as well as younger than itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">732</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">733</span> <div class="sentence">  And it is older (is it not?)</div><div class="sentence"> when in becoming, it gets to the point of time between 'was' and 'will be,' which is 'now': for surely in going from the past to the future, it cannot skip the present?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">734</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">735</span> <div class="sentence">  And when it arrives at the present it stops from becoming older, and no longer becomes, but is older, for if it went on it would never be reached by the present, for it is the nature of that which goes on, to touch both the present and the future, letting go the present and seizing the future, while in process of becoming between them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">736</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">737</span> <div class="sentence">  But that which is becoming cannot skip the present; when it reaches the present it ceases to become, and is then whatever it may happen to be becoming.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">738</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">739</span> <div class="sentence">  And so the one, when in becoming older it reaches the present, ceases to become, and is then older.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">740</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">741</span> <div class="sentence">  And it is older than that than which it was becoming older, and it was becoming older than itself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">742</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">743</span> <div class="sentence">  And that which is older is older than that which is younger?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">744</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">745</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one is younger than itself, when in becoming older it reaches the present?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">746</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">747</span> <div class="sentence">  But the present is always present with the one during all its being; for whenever it is it is always now.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">748</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">749</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one always both is and becomes older and younger than itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">750</span> <div class="sentence">  Truly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">751</span> <div class="sentence">  And is it or does it become a longer time than itself or an equal time with itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">752</span> <div class="sentence">  An equal time.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">753</span> <div class="sentence">  But if it becomes or is for an equal time with itself, it is of the same age with itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">754</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">755</span> <div class="sentence">  And that which is of the same age, is neither older nor younger?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">756</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">757</span> <div class="sentence">  The one, then, becoming and being the same time with itself, neither is nor becomes older or younger than itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">758</span> <div class="sentence">  I should say not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">759</span> <div class="sentence">  And what are its relations to other things?</div><div class="sentence"> Is it or does it become older or younger than they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">760</span> <div class="sentence">  I cannot tell you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">761</span> <div class="sentence">  You can at least tell me that others than the one are more than the one—other would have been one, but the others have multitude, and are more than one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">762</span> <div class="sentence">  They will have multitude.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">763</span> <div class="sentence">  And a multitude implies a number larger than one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">764</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">765</span> <div class="sentence">  And shall we say that the lesser or the greater is the first to come or to have come into existence?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">766</span> <div class="sentence">  The lesser.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">767</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the least is the first?</div><div class="sentence"> And that is the one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">768</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">769</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one of all things that have number is the first to come into being; but all other things have also number, being plural and not singular.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">770</span> <div class="sentence">  They have.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">771</span> <div class="sentence">  And since it came into being first it must be supposed to have come into being prior to the others, and the others later; and the things which came into being later, are younger than that which preceded them?</div><div class="sentence"> And so the other things will be younger than the one, and the one older than other things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">772</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">773</span> <div class="sentence">  What would you say of another question?</div><div class="sentence"> Can the one have come into being contrary to its own nature, or is that impossible?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">774</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">775</span> <div class="sentence">  And yet, surely, the one was shown to have parts; and if parts, then a beginning, middle and end?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">776</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">777</span> <div class="sentence">  And a beginning, both of the one itself and of all other things, comes into being first of all; and after the beginning, the others follow, until you reach the end?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">778</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">779</span> <div class="sentence">  And all these others we shall affirm to be parts of the whole and of the one, which, as soon as the end is reached, has become whole and one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">780</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes; that is what we shall say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">781</span> <div class="sentence">  But the end comes last, and the one is of such a nature as to come into being with the last; and, since the one cannot come into being except in accordance with its own nature, its nature will require that it should come into being after the others, simultaneously with the end.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">782</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">783</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one is younger than the others and the others older than the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">784</span> <div class="sentence">  That also is clear in my judgment.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">785</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, and must not a beginning or any other part of the one or of anything, if it be a part and not parts, being a part, be also of necessity one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">786</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">787</span> <div class="sentence">  And will not the one come into being together with each part—together with the first part when that comes into being, and together with the second part and with all the rest, and will not be wanting to any part, which is added to any other part until it has reached the last and become one whole; it will be wanting neither to the middle, nor to the first, nor to the last, nor to any of them, while the process of becoming is going on?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">788</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">789</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one is of the same age with all the others, so that if the one itself does not contradict its own nature, it will be neither prior nor posterior to the others, but simultaneous; and according to this argument the one will be neither older nor younger than the others, nor the others than the one, but according to the previous argument the one will be older and younger than the others and the others than the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">790</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">791</span> <div class="sentence">  After this manner then the one is and has become.</div><div class="sentence"> But as to its becoming older and younger than the others, and the others than the one, and neither older nor younger, what shall we say?</div><div class="sentence"> Shall we say as of being so also of becoming, or otherwise?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">792</span> <div class="sentence">  I cannot answer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">793</span> <div class="sentence">  But I can venture to say, that even if one thing were older or younger than another, it could not become older or younger in a greater degree than it was at first; for equals added to unequals, whether to periods of time or to anything else, leave the difference between them the same as at first.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">794</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">795</span> <div class="sentence">  Then that which is, cannot become older or younger than that which is, since the difference of age is always the same; the one is and has become older and the other younger; but they are no longer becoming so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">796</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">797</span> <div class="sentence">  And the one which is does not therefore become either older or younger than the others which are.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">798</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">799</span> <div class="sentence">  But consider whether they may not become older and younger in another way.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">800</span> <div class="sentence">  In what way?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">801</span> <div class="sentence">  Just as the one was proven to be older than the others and the others than the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">802</span> <div class="sentence">  And what of that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">803</span> <div class="sentence">  If the one is older than the others, has come into being a longer time than the others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">804</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">805</span> <div class="sentence">  But consider again; if we add equal time to a greater and a less time, will the greater differ from the less time by an equal or by a smaller portion than before?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">806</span> <div class="sentence">  By a smaller portion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">807</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the difference between the age of the one and the age of the others will not be afterwards so great as at first, but if an equal time be added to both of them they will differ less and less in age?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">808</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">809</span> <div class="sentence">  And that which differs in age from some other less than formerly, from being older will become younger in relation to that other than which it was older?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">810</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, younger.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">811</span> <div class="sentence">  And if the one becomes younger the others aforesaid will become older than they were before, in relation to the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">812</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">813</span> <div class="sentence">  Then that which had become younger becomes older relatively to that which previously had become and was older; it never really is older, but is always becoming, for the one is always growing on the side of youth and the other on the side of age.</div><div class="sentence"> And in like manner the older is always in process of becoming younger than the younger; for as they are always going in opposite directions they become in ways the opposite to one another, the younger older than the older, and the older younger than the younger.</div><div class="sentence"> They cannot, however, have become; for if they had already become they would be and not merely become.</div><div class="sentence"> But that is impossible; for they are always becoming both older and younger than one another: the one becomes younger than the others because it was seen to be older and prior, and the others become older than the one because they came into being later; and in the same way the others are in the same relation to the one, because they were seen to be older, and prior to the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">814</span> <div class="sentence">  That is clear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">815</span> <div class="sentence">  Inasmuch then, one thing does not become older or younger than another, in that they always differ from each other by an equal number, the one cannot become older or younger than the others, nor the others than the one; but inasmuch as that which came into being earlier and that which came into being later must continually differ from each other by a different portion—in this point of view the others must become older and younger than the one, and the one than the others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">816</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">817</span> <div class="sentence">  For all these reasons, then, the one is and becomes older and younger than itself and the others, and neither is nor becomes older or younger than itself or the others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">818</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">819</span> <div class="sentence">  But since the one partakes of time, and partakes of becoming older and younger, must it not also partake of the past, the present, and the future?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">820</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course it must.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">821</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one was and is and will be, and was becoming and is becoming and will become?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">822</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">823</span> <div class="sentence">  And there is and was and will be something which is in relation to it and belongs to it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">824</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">825</span> <div class="sentence">  And since we have at this moment opinion and knowledge and perception of the one, there is opinion and knowledge and perception of it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">826</span> <div class="sentence">  Quite right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">827</span> <div class="sentence">  Then there is name and expression for it, and it is named and expressed, and everything of this kind which appertains to other things appertains to the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">828</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly, that is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">829</span> <div class="sentence">  Yet once more and for the third time, let us consider: If the one is both one and many, as we have described, and is neither one nor many, and participates in time, must it not, in as far as it is one, at times partake of being, and in as far as it is not one, at times not partake of being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">830</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">831</span> <div class="sentence">  But can it partake of being when not partaking of being, or not partake of being when partaking of being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">832</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">833</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one partakes and does not partake of being at different times, for that is the only way in which it can partake and not partake of the same.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">834</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">835</span> <div class="sentence">  And is there not also a time at which it assumes being and relinquishes being—for how can it have and not have the same thing unless it receives and also gives it up at some time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">836</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">837</span> <div class="sentence">  And the assuming of being is what you would call becoming?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">838</span> <div class="sentence">  I should.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">839</span> <div class="sentence">  And the relinquishing of being you would call destruction?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">840</span> <div class="sentence">  I should.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">841</span> <div class="sentence">  The one then, as would appear, becomes and is destroyed by taking and giving up being.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">842</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">843</span> <div class="sentence">  And being one and many and in process of becoming and being destroyed, when it becomes one it ceases to be many, and when many, it ceases to be one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">844</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">845</span> <div class="sentence">  And as it becomes one and many, must it not inevitably experience separation and aggregation?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">846</span> <div class="sentence">  Inevitably.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">847</span> <div class="sentence">  And whenever it becomes like and unlike it must be assimilated and dissimilated?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">848</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">849</span> <div class="sentence">  And when it becomes greater or less or equal it must grow or diminish or be equalized?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">850</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">851</span> <div class="sentence">  And when being in motion it rests, and when being at rest it changes to motion, it can surely be in no time at all?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">852</span> <div class="sentence">  How can it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">853</span> <div class="sentence">  But that a thing which is previously at rest should be afterwards in motion, or previously in motion and afterwards at rest, without experiencing change, is impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">854</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">855</span> <div class="sentence">  And surely there cannot be a time in which a thing can be at once neither in motion nor at rest?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">856</span> <div class="sentence">  There cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">857</span> <div class="sentence">  But neither can it change without changing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">858</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">859</span> <div class="sentence">  When then does it change; for it cannot change either when at rest, or when in motion, or when in time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">860</span> <div class="sentence">  It cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">861</span> <div class="sentence">  And does this strange thing in which it is at the time of changing really exist?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">862</span> <div class="sentence">  What thing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">863</span> <div class="sentence">  The moment.</div><div class="sentence"> For the moment seems to imply a something out of which change takes place into either of two states; for the change is not from the state of rest as such, nor from the state of motion as such; but there is this curious nature which we call the moment lying between rest and motion, not being in any time; and into this and out of this what is in motion changes into rest, and what is at rest into motion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">864</span> <div class="sentence">  So it appears.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">865</span> <div class="sentence">  And the one then, since it is at rest and also in motion, will change to either, for only in this way can it be in both.</div><div class="sentence"> And in changing it changes in a moment, and when it is changing it will be in no time, and will not then be either in motion or at rest.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">866</span> <div class="sentence">  It will not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">867</span> <div class="sentence">  And it will be in the same case in relation to the other changes, when it passes from being into cessation of being, or from not-being into becoming—then it passes between certain states of motion and rest, and neither is nor is not, nor becomes nor is destroyed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">868</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">869</span> <div class="sentence">  And on the same principle, in the passage from one to many and from many to one, the one is neither one nor many, neither separated nor aggregated; and in the passage from like to unlike, and from unlike to like, it is neither like nor unlike, neither in a state of assimilation nor of dissimilation; and in the passage from small to great and equal and back again, it will be neither small nor great, nor equal, nor in a state of increase, or diminution, or equalization.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">870</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">871</span> <div class="sentence">  All these, then, are the affections of the one, if the one has being.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">872</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">873</span> <div class="sentence">  1.aa.</div><div class="sentence"> But if one is, what will happen to the others—is not that also to be considered?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">874</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">875</span> <div class="sentence">  Let us show then, if one is, what will be the affections of the others than the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">876</span> <div class="sentence">  Let us do so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">877</span> <div class="sentence">  Inasmuch as there are things other than the one, the others are not the one; for if they were they could not be other than the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">878</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">879</span> <div class="sentence">  Nor are the others altogether without the one, but in a certain way they participate in the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">880</span> <div class="sentence">  In what way?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">881</span> <div class="sentence">  Because the others are other than the one inasmuch as they have parts; for if they had no parts they would be simply one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">882</span> <div class="sentence">  Right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">883</span> <div class="sentence">  And parts, as we affirm, have relation to a whole?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">884</span> <div class="sentence">  So we say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">885</span> <div class="sentence">  And a whole must necessarily be one made up of many; and the parts will be parts of the one, for each of the parts is not a part of many, but of a whole.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">886</span> <div class="sentence">  How do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">887</span> <div class="sentence">  If anything were a part of many, being itself one of them, it will surely be a part of itself, which is impossible, and it will be a part of each one of the other parts, if of all; for if not a part of some one, it will be a part of all the others but this one, and thus will not be a part of each one; and if not a part of each, one it will not be a part of any one of the many; and not being a part of any one, it cannot be a part or anything else of all those things of none of which it is anything.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">888</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">889</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the part is not a part of the many, nor of all, but is of a certain single form, which we call a whole, being one perfect unity framed out of all—of this the part will be a part.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">890</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">891</span> <div class="sentence">  If, then, the others have parts, they will participate in the whole and in the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">892</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">893</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the others than the one must be one perfect whole, having parts.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">894</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">895</span> <div class="sentence">  And the same argument holds of each part, for the part must participate in the one; for if each of the parts is a part, this means, I suppose, that it is one separate from the rest and self-related; otherwise it is not each.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">896</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">897</span> <div class="sentence">  But when we speak of the part participating in the one, it must clearly be other than one; for if not, it would not merely have participated, but would have been one; whereas only the itself can be one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">898</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">899</span> <div class="sentence">  Both the whole and the part must participate in the one; for the whole will be one whole, of which the parts will be parts; and each part will be one part of the whole which is the whole of the part.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">900</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">901</span> <div class="sentence">  And will not the things which participate in the one, be other than it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">902</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">903</span> <div class="sentence">  And the things which are other than the one will be many; for if the things which are other than the one were neither one nor more than one, they would be nothing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">904</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">905</span> <div class="sentence">  But, seeing that the things which participate in the one as a part, and in the one as a whole, are more than one, must not those very things which participate in the one be infinite in number?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">906</span> <div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">907</span> <div class="sentence">  Let us look at the matter thus:—Is it not a fact that in partaking of the one they are not one, and do not partake of the one at the very time when they are partaking of it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">908</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">909</span> <div class="sentence">  They do so then as multitudes in which the one is not present?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">910</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">911</span> <div class="sentence">  And if we were to abstract from them in idea the very smallest fraction, must not that least fraction, if it does not partake of the one, be a multitude and not one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">912</span> <div class="sentence">  It must.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">913</span> <div class="sentence">  And if we continue to look at the other side of their nature, regarded simply, and in itself, will not they, as far as we see them, be unlimited in number?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">914</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">915</span> <div class="sentence">  And yet, when each several part becomes a part, then the parts have a limit in relation to the whole and to each other, and the whole in relation to the parts.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">916</span> <div class="sentence">  Just so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">917</span> <div class="sentence">  The result to the others than the one is that the union of themselves and the one appears to create a new element in them which gives to them limitation in relation to one another; whereas in their own nature they have no limit.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">918</span> <div class="sentence">  That is clear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">919</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the others than the one, both as whole and parts, are infinite, and also partake of limit.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">920</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">921</span> <div class="sentence">  Then they are both like and unlike one another and themselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">922</span> <div class="sentence">  How is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">923</span> <div class="sentence">  Inasmuch as they are unlimited in their own nature, they are all affected in the same way.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">924</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">925</span> <div class="sentence">  And inasmuch as they all partake of limit, they are all affected in the same way.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">926</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">927</span> <div class="sentence">  But inasmuch as their state is both limited and unlimited, they are affected in opposite ways.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">928</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">929</span> <div class="sentence">  And opposites are the most unlike of things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">930</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">931</span> <div class="sentence">  Considered, then, in regard to either one of their affections, they will be like themselves and one another; considered in reference to both of them together, most opposed and most unlike.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">932</span> <div class="sentence">  That appears to be true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">933</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the others are both like and unlike themselves and one another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">934</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">935</span> <div class="sentence">  And they are the same and also different from one another, and in motion and at rest, and experience every sort of opposite affection, as may be proved without difficulty of them, since they have been shown to have experienced the affections aforesaid?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">936</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">937</span> <div class="sentence">  1.bb.</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose, now, that we leave the further discussion of these matters as evident, and consider again upon the hypothesis that the one is, whether opposite of all this is or is not equally true of the others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">938</span> <div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">939</span> <div class="sentence">  Then let us begin again, and ask, If one is, what must be the affections of the others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">940</span> <div class="sentence">  Let us ask that question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">941</span> <div class="sentence">  Must not the one be distinct from the others, and the others from the one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">942</span> <div class="sentence">  Why so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">943</span> <div class="sentence">  Why, because there is nothing else beside them which is distinct from both of them; for the expression 'one and the others' includes all things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">944</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, all things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">945</span> <div class="sentence">  Then we cannot suppose that there is anything different from them in which both the one and the others might exist?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">946</span> <div class="sentence">  There is nothing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">947</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one and the others are never in the same?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">948</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">949</span> <div class="sentence">  Then they are separated from each other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">950</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">951</span> <div class="sentence">  And we surely cannot say that what is truly one has parts?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">952</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">953</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one will not be in the others as a whole, nor as part, if it be separated from the others, and has no parts?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">954</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">955</span> <div class="sentence">  Then there is no way in which the others can partake of the one, if they do not partake either in whole or in part?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">956</span> <div class="sentence">  It would seem not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">957</span> <div class="sentence">  Then there is no way in which the others are one, or have in themselves any unity?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">958</span> <div class="sentence">  There is not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">959</span> <div class="sentence">  Nor are the others many; for if they were many, each part of them would be a part of the whole; but now the others, not partaking in any way of the one, are neither one nor many, nor whole, nor part.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">960</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">961</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the others neither are nor contain two or three, if entirely deprived of the one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">962</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">963</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the others are neither like nor unlike the one, nor is likeness and unlikeness in them; for if they were like and unlike, or had in them likeness and unlikeness, they would have two natures in them opposite to one another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">964</span> <div class="sentence">  That is clear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">965</span> <div class="sentence">  But for that which partakes of nothing to partake of two things was held by us to be impossible?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">966</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">967</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the others are neither like nor unlike nor both, for if they were like or unlike they would partake of one of those two natures, which would be one thing, and if they were both they would partake of opposites which would be two things, and this has been shown to be impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">968</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">969</span> <div class="sentence">  Therefore they are neither the same, nor other, nor in motion, nor at rest, nor in a state of becoming, nor of being destroyed, nor greater, nor less, nor equal, nor have they experienced anything else of the sort; for, if they are capable of experiencing any such affection, they will participate in one and two and three, and odd and even, and in these, as has been proved, they do not participate, seeing that they are altogether and in every way devoid of the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">970</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">971</span> <div class="sentence">  Therefore if one is, the one is all things, and also nothing, both in relation to itself and to other things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">972</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">973</span> <div class="sentence">  2.a.</div><div class="sentence"> Well, and ought we not to consider next what will be the consequence if the one is not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">974</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes; we ought.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">975</span> <div class="sentence">  What is the meaning of the hypothesis—If the one is not; is there any difference between this and the hypothesis—If the not one is not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">976</span> <div class="sentence">  There is a difference, certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">977</span> <div class="sentence">  Is there a difference only, or rather are not the two expressions—if the one is not, and if the not one is not, entirely opposed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">978</span> <div class="sentence">  They are entirely opposed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">979</span> <div class="sentence">  And suppose a person to say:—If greatness is not, if smallness is not, or anything of that sort, does he not mean, whenever he uses such an expression, that 'what is not' is other than other things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">980</span> <div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">981</span> <div class="sentence">  And so when he says 'If one is not' he clearly means, that what 'is not' is other than all others; we know what he means—do we not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">982</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, we do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">983</span> <div class="sentence">  When he says 'one,' he says something which is known; and secondly something which is other than all other things; it makes no difference whether he predicate of one being or not-being, for that which is said 'not to be' is known to be something all the same, and is distinguished from other things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">984</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">985</span> <div class="sentence">  Then I will begin again, and ask: If one is not, what are the consequences?</div><div class="sentence"> In the first place, as would appear, there is a knowledge of it, or the very meaning of the words, 'if one is not,' would not be known.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">986</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">987</span> <div class="sentence">  Secondly, the others differ from it, or it could not be described as different from the others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">988</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">989</span> <div class="sentence">  Difference, then, belongs to it as well as knowledge; for in speaking of the one as different from the others, we do not speak of a difference in the others, but in the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">990</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">991</span> <div class="sentence">  Moreover, the one that is not is something and partakes of relation to 'that,' and 'this,' and 'these,' and the like, and is an attribute of 'this'; for the one, or the others than the one, could not have been spoken of, nor could any attribute or relative of the one that is not have been or been spoken of, nor could it have been said to be anything, if it did not partake of 'some,' or of the other relations just now mentioned.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">992</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">993</span> <div class="sentence">  Being, then, cannot be ascribed to the one, since it is not; but the one that is not may or rather must participate in many things, if it and nothing else is not; if, however, neither the one nor the one that is not is supposed not to be, and we are speaking of something of a different nature, we can predicate nothing of it.</div><div class="sentence"> But supposing that the one that is not and nothing else is not, then it must participate in the predicate 'that,' and in many others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">994</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">995</span> <div class="sentence">  And it will have unlikeness in relation to the others, for the others being different from the one will be of a different kind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">996</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">997</span> <div class="sentence">  And are not things of a different kind also other in kind?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">998</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">999</span> <div class="sentence">  And are not things other in kind unlike?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1000</span> <div class="sentence">  They are unlike.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1001</span> <div class="sentence">  And if they are unlike the one, that which they are unlike will clearly be unlike them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1002</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1003</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one will have unlikeness in respect of which the others are unlike it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1004</span> <div class="sentence">  That would seem to be true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1005</span> <div class="sentence">  And if unlikeness to other things is attributed to it, it must have likeness to itself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1006</span> <div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1007</span> <div class="sentence">  If the one have unlikeness to one, something else must be meant; nor will the hypothesis relate to one; but it will relate to something other than one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1008</span> <div class="sentence">  Quite so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1009</span> <div class="sentence">  But that cannot be.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1010</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1011</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one must have likeness to itself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1012</span> <div class="sentence">  It must.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1013</span> <div class="sentence">  Again, it is not equal to the others; for if it were equal, then it would at once be and be like them in virtue of the equality; but if one has no being, then it can neither be nor be like?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1014</span> <div class="sentence">  It cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1015</span> <div class="sentence">  But since it is not equal to the others, neither can the others be equal to it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1016</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1017</span> <div class="sentence">  And things that are not equal are unequal?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1018</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1019</span> <div class="sentence">  And they are unequal to an unequal?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1020</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1021</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one partakes of inequality, and in respect of this the others are unequal to it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1022</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1023</span> <div class="sentence">  And inequality implies greatness and smallness?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1024</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1025</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one, if of such a nature, has greatness and smallness?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1026</span> <div class="sentence">  That appears to be true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1027</span> <div class="sentence">  And greatness and smallness always stand apart?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1028</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1029</span> <div class="sentence">  Then there is always something between them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1030</span> <div class="sentence">  There is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1031</span> <div class="sentence">  And can you think of anything else which is between them other than equality?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1032</span> <div class="sentence">  No, it is equality which lies between them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1033</span> <div class="sentence">  Then that which has greatness and smallness also has equality, which lies between them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1034</span> <div class="sentence">  That is clear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1035</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one, which is not, partakes, as would appear, of greatness and smallness and equality?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1036</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1037</span> <div class="sentence">  Further, it must surely in a sort partake of being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1038</span> <div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1039</span> <div class="sentence">  It must be so, for if not, then we should not speak the truth in saying that the one is not.</div><div class="sentence"> But if we speak the truth, clearly we must say what is.</div><div class="sentence"> Am I not right?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1040</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1041</span> <div class="sentence">  And since we affirm that we speak truly, we must also affirm that we say what is?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1042</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1043</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, as would appear, the one, when it is not, is; for if it were not to be when it is not, but (Or, 'to remit something of existence in relation to not-being.')</div><div class="sentence"> were to relinquish something of being, so as to become not-being, it would at once be.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1044</span> <div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1045</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one which is not, if it is to maintain itself, must have the being of not-being as the bond of not-being, just as being must have as a bond the not-being of not-being in order to perfect its own being; for the truest assertion of the being of being and of the not-being of not-being is when being partakes of the being of being, and not of the being of not-being—that is, the perfection of being; and when not-being does not partake of the not-being of not-being but of the being of not-being—that is the perfection of not-being.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1046</span> <div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1047</span> <div class="sentence">  Since then what is partakes of not-being, and what is not of being, must not the one also partake of being in order not to be?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1048</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1049</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one, if it is not, clearly has being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1050</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1051</span> <div class="sentence">  And has not-being also, if it is not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1052</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1053</span> <div class="sentence">  But can anything which is in a certain state not be in that state without changing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1054</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1055</span> <div class="sentence">  Then everything which is and is not in a certain state, implies change?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1056</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1057</span> <div class="sentence">  And change is motion—we may say that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1058</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes, motion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1059</span> <div class="sentence">  And the one has been proved both to be and not to be?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1060</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1061</span> <div class="sentence">  And therefore is and is not in the same state?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1062</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1063</span> <div class="sentence">  Thus the one that is not has been shown to have motion also, because it changes from being to not-being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1064</span> <div class="sentence">  That appears to be true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1065</span> <div class="sentence">  But surely if it is nowhere among what is, as is the fact, since it is not, it cannot change from one place to another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1066</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1067</span> <div class="sentence">  Then it cannot move by changing place?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1068</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1069</span> <div class="sentence">  Nor can it turn on the same spot, for it nowhere touches the same, for the same is, and that which is not cannot be reckoned among things that are?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1070</span> <div class="sentence">  It cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1071</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one, if it is not, cannot turn in that in which it is not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1072</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1073</span> <div class="sentence">  Neither can the one, whether it is or is not, be altered into other than itself, for if it altered and became different from itself, then we could not be still speaking of the one, but of something else?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1074</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1075</span> <div class="sentence">  But if the one neither suffers alteration, nor turns round in the same place, nor changes place, can it still be capable of motion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1076</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1077</span> <div class="sentence">  Now that which is unmoved must surely be at rest, and that which is at rest must stand still?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1078</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1079</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one that is not, stands still, and is also in motion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1080</span> <div class="sentence">  That seems to be true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1081</span> <div class="sentence">  But if it be in motion it must necessarily undergo alteration, for anything which is moved, in so far as it is moved, is no longer in the same state, but in another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1082</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1083</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one, being moved, is altered?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1084</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1085</span> <div class="sentence">  And, further, if not moved in any way, it will not be altered in any way?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1086</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1087</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, in so far as the one that is not is moved, it is altered, but in so far as it is not moved, it is not altered?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1088</span> <div class="sentence">  Right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1089</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one that is not is altered and is not altered?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1090</span> <div class="sentence">  That is clear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1091</span> <div class="sentence">  And must not that which is altered become other than it previously was, and lose its former state and be destroyed; but that which is not altered can neither come into being nor be destroyed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1092</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1093</span> <div class="sentence">  And the one that is not, being altered, becomes and is destroyed; and not being altered, neither becomes nor is destroyed; and so the one that is not becomes and is destroyed, and neither becomes nor is destroyed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1094</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1095</span> <div class="sentence">  2.b.</div><div class="sentence"> And now, let us go back once more to the beginning, and see whether these or some other consequences will follow.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1096</span> <div class="sentence">  Let us do as you say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1097</span> <div class="sentence">  If one is not, we ask what will happen in respect of one?</div><div class="sentence"> That is the question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1098</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1099</span> <div class="sentence">  Do not the words 'is not' signify absence of being in that to which we apply them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1100</span> <div class="sentence">  Just so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1101</span> <div class="sentence">  And when we say that a thing is not, do we mean that it is not in one way but is in another?</div><div class="sentence"> or do we mean, absolutely, that what is not has in no sort or way or kind participation of being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1102</span> <div class="sentence">  Quite absolutely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1103</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, that which is not cannot be, or in any way participate in being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1104</span> <div class="sentence">  It cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1105</span> <div class="sentence">  And did we not mean by becoming, and being destroyed, the assumption of being and the loss of being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1106</span> <div class="sentence">  Nothing else.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1107</span> <div class="sentence">  And can that which has no participation in being, either assume or lose being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1108</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1109</span> <div class="sentence">  The one then, since it in no way is, cannot have or lose or assume being in any way?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1110</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1111</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one that is not, since it in no way partakes of being, neither perishes nor becomes?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1112</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1113</span> <div class="sentence">  Then it is not altered at all; for if it were it would become and be destroyed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1114</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1115</span> <div class="sentence">  But if it be not altered it cannot be moved?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1116</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1117</span> <div class="sentence">  Nor can we say that it stands, if it is nowhere; for that which stands must always be in one and the same spot?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1118</span> <div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1119</span> <div class="sentence">  Then we must say that the one which is not never stands still and never moves?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1120</span> <div class="sentence">  Neither.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1121</span> <div class="sentence">  Nor is there any existing thing which can be attributed to it; for if there had been, it would partake of being?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1122</span> <div class="sentence">  That is clear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1123</span> <div class="sentence">  And therefore neither smallness, nor greatness, nor equality, can be attributed to it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1124</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1125</span> <div class="sentence">  Nor yet likeness nor difference, either in relation to itself or to others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1126</span> <div class="sentence">  Clearly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1127</span> <div class="sentence">  Well, and if nothing should be attributed to it, can other things be attributed to it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1128</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1129</span> <div class="sentence">  And therefore other things can neither be like or unlike, the same, or different in relation to it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1130</span> <div class="sentence">  They cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1131</span> <div class="sentence">  Nor can what is not, be anything, or be this thing, or be related to or the attribute of this or that or other, or be past, present, or future.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor can knowledge, or opinion, or perception, or expression, or name, or any other thing that is, have any concern with it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1132</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1133</span> <div class="sentence">  Then the one that is not has no condition of any kind?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1134</span> <div class="sentence">  Such appears to be the conclusion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1135</span> <div class="sentence">  2.aa.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet once more; if one is not, what becomes of the others?</div><div class="sentence"> Let us determine that.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1136</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes; let us determine that.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1137</span> <div class="sentence">  The others must surely be; for if they, like the one, were not, we could not be now speaking of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1138</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1139</span> <div class="sentence">  But to speak of the others implies difference—the terms 'other' and 'different' are synonymous?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1140</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1141</span> <div class="sentence">  Other means other than other, and different, different from the different?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1142</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1143</span> <div class="sentence">  Then, if there are to be others, there is something than which they will be other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1144</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1145</span> <div class="sentence">  And what can that be?—for if the one is not, they will not be other than the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1146</span> <div class="sentence">  They will not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1147</span> <div class="sentence">  Then they will be other than each other; for the only remaining alternative is that they are other than nothing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1148</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1149</span> <div class="sentence">  And they are each other than one another, as being plural and not singular; for if one is not, they cannot be singular, but every particle of them is infinite in number; and even if a person takes that which appears to be the smallest fraction, this, which seemed one, in a moment evanesces into many, as in a dream, and from being the smallest becomes very great, in comparison with the fractions into which it is split up?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1150</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1151</span> <div class="sentence">  And in such particles the others will be other than one another, if others are, and the one is not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1152</span> <div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1153</span> <div class="sentence">  And will there not be many particles, each appearing to be one, but not being one, if one is not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1154</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1155</span> <div class="sentence">  And it would seem that number can be predicated of them if each of them appears to be one, though it is really many?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1156</span> <div class="sentence">  It can.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1157</span> <div class="sentence">  And there will seem to be odd and even among them, which will also have no reality, if one is not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1158</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1159</span> <div class="sentence">  And there will appear to be a least among them; and even this will seem large and manifold in comparison with the many small fractions which are contained in it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1160</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1161</span> <div class="sentence">  And each particle will be imagined to be equal to the many and little; for it could not have appeared to pass from the greater to the less without having appeared to arrive at the middle; and thus would arise the appearance of equality.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1162</span> <div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1163</span> <div class="sentence">  And having neither beginning, middle, nor end, each separate particle yet appears to have a limit in relation to itself and other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1164</span> <div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1165</span> <div class="sentence">  Because, when a person conceives of any one of these as such, prior to the beginning another beginning appears, and there is another end, remaining after the end, and in the middle truer middles within but smaller, because no unity can be conceived of any of them, since the one is not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1166</span> <div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1167</span> <div class="sentence">  And so all being, whatever we think of, must be broken up into fractions, for a particle will have to be conceived of without unity?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1168</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1169</span> <div class="sentence">  And such being when seen indistinctly and at a distance, appears to be one; but when seen near and with keen intellect, every single thing appears to be infinite, since it is deprived of the one, which is not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1170</span> <div class="sentence">  Nothing more certain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1171</span> <div class="sentence">  Then each of the others must appear to be infinite and finite, and one and many, if others than the one exist and not the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1172</span> <div class="sentence">  They must.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1173</span> <div class="sentence">  Then will they not appear to be like and unlike?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1174</span> <div class="sentence">  In what way?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1175</span> <div class="sentence">  Just as in a picture things appear to be all one to a person standing at a distance, and to be in the same state and alike?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1176</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1177</span> <div class="sentence">  But when you approach them, they appear to be many and different; and because of the appearance of the difference, different in kind from, and unlike, themselves?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1178</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1179</span> <div class="sentence">  And so must the particles appear to be like and unlike themselves and each other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1180</span> <div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1181</span> <div class="sentence">  And must they not be the same and yet different from one another, and in contact with themselves, although they are separated, and having every sort of motion, and every sort of rest, and becoming and being destroyed, and in neither state, and the like, all which things may be easily enumerated, if the one is not and the many are?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1182</span> <div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1183</span> <div class="sentence">  2.bb.</div><div class="sentence"> Once more, let us go back to the beginning, and ask if the one is not, and the others of the one are, what will follow.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1185</span> <div class="sentence">  In the first place, the others will not be one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1186</span> <div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1192</span> <div class="sentence">  Why not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1193</span> <div class="sentence">  Because the others have no sort or manner or way of communion with any sort of not-being, nor can anything which is not, be connected with any of the others; for that which is not has no parts.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1194</span> <div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1195</span> <div class="sentence">  Nor is there an opinion or any appearance of not-being in connexion with the others, nor is not-being ever in any way attributed to the others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1196</span> <div class="sentence">  No.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1197</span> <div class="sentence">  Then if one is not, there is no conception of any of the others either as one or many; for you cannot conceive the many without the one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1198</span> <div class="sentence">  You cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1199</span> <div class="sentence">  Then if one is not, the others neither are, nor can be conceived to be either one or many?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1200</span> <div class="sentence">  It would seem not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">1201</span> <div class="sentence">  Nor as like or unlike?</div></div>
