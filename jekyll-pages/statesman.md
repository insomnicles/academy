<h2>INTRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  In the Phaedrus, the Republic, the Philebus, the Parmenides, and the Sophist, we may observe the tendency of Plato to combine two or more subjects or different aspects of the same subject in a single dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> In the Sophist and Statesman especially we note that the discussion is partly regarded as an illustration of method, and that analogies are brought from afar which throw light on the main subject.</div><div class="sentence"> And in his later writings generally we further remark a decline of style, and of dramatic power; the characters excite little or no interest, and the digressions are apt to overlay the main thesis; there is not the 'callida junctura' of an artistic whole.</div><div class="sentence"> Both the serious discussions and the jests are sometimes out of place.</div><div class="sentence"> The invincible Socrates is withdrawn from view; and new foes begin to appear under old names.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato is now chiefly concerned, not with the original Sophist, but with the sophistry of the schools of philosophy, which are making reasoning impossible; and is driven by them out of the regions of transcendental speculation back into the path of common sense.</div><div class="sentence"> A logical or psychological phase takes the place of the doctrine of Ideas in his mind.</div><div class="sentence"> He is constantly dwelling on the importance of regular classification, and of not putting words in the place of things.</div><div class="sentence"> He has banished the poets, and is beginning to use a technical language.</div><div class="sentence"> He is bitter and satirical, and seems to be sadly conscious of the realities of human life.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet the ideal glory of the Platonic philosophy is not extinguished.</div><div class="sentence"> He is still looking for a city in which kings are either philosophers or gods (compare Laws).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  The Statesman has lost the grace and beauty of the earlier dialogues.</div><div class="sentence"> The mind of the writer seems to be so overpowered in the effort of thought as to impair his style; at least his gift of expression does not keep up with the increasing difficulty of his theme.</div><div class="sentence"> The idea of the king or statesman and the illustration of method are connected, not like the love and rhetoric of the Phaedrus, by 'little invisible pegs,' but in a confused and inartistic manner, which fails to produce any impression of a whole on the mind of the reader.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato apologizes for his tediousness, and acknowledges that the improvement of his audience has been his only aim in some of his digressions.</div><div class="sentence"> His own image may be used as a motto of his style: like an inexpert statuary he has made the figure or outline too large, and is unable to give the proper colours or proportions to his work.</div><div class="sentence"> He makes mistakes only to correct them—this seems to be his way of drawing attention to common dialectical errors.</div><div class="sentence"> The Eleatic stranger, here, as in the Sophist, has no appropriate character, and appears only as the expositor of a political ideal, in the delineation of which he is frequently interrupted by purely logical illustrations.</div><div class="sentence"> The younger Socrates resembles his namesake in nothing but a name.</div><div class="sentence"> The dramatic character is so completely forgotten, that a special reference is twice made to discussions in the Sophist; and this, perhaps, is the strongest ground which can be urged for doubting the genuineness of the work.</div><div class="sentence"> But, when we remember that a similar allusion is made in the Laws to the Republic, we see that the entire disregard of dramatic propriety is not always a sufficient reason for doubting the genuineness of a Platonic writing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  The search after the Statesman, which is carried on, like that for the Sophist, by the method of dichotomy, gives an opportunity for many humorous and satirical remarks.</div><div class="sentence"> Several of the jests are mannered and laboured: for example, the turn of words with which the dialogue opens; or the clumsy joke about man being an animal, who has a power of two-feet—both which are suggested by the presence of Theodorus, the geometrician.</div><div class="sentence"> There is political as well as logical insight in refusing to admit the division of mankind into Hellenes and Barbarians: 'if a crane could speak, he would in like manner oppose men and all other animals to cranes.'</div><div class="sentence"> The pride of the Hellene is further humbled, by being compared to a Phrygian or Lydian.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato glories in this impartiality of the dialectical method, which places birds in juxtaposition with men, and the king side by side with the bird-catcher; king or vermin-destroyer are objects of equal interest to science (compare Parmen.).</div><div class="sentence"> There are other passages which show that the irony of Socrates was a lesson which Plato was not slow in learning—as, for example, the passing remark, that 'the kings and statesmen of our day are in their breeding and education very like their subjects;' or the anticipation that the rivals of the king will be found in the class of servants; or the imposing attitude of the priests, who are the established interpreters of the will of heaven, authorized by law.</div><div class="sentence"> Nothing is more bitter in all his writings than his comparison of the contemporary politicians to lions, centaurs, satyrs, and other animals of a feebler sort, who are ever changing their forms and natures.</div><div class="sentence"> But, as in the later dialogues generally, the play of humour and the charm of poetry have departed, never to return.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  Still the Politicus contains a higher and more ideal conception of politics than any other of Plato's writings.</div><div class="sentence"> The city of which there is a pattern in heaven (Republic), is here described as a Paradisiacal state of human society.</div><div class="sentence"> In the truest sense of all, the ruler is not man but God; and such a government existed in a former cycle of human history, and may again exist when the gods resume their care of mankind.</div><div class="sentence"> In a secondary sense, the true form of government is that which has scientific rulers, who are irresponsible to their subjects.</div><div class="sentence"> Not power but knowledge is the characteristic of a king or royal person.</div><div class="sentence"> And the rule of a man is better and higher than law, because he is more able to deal with the infinite complexity of human affairs.</div><div class="sentence"> But mankind, in despair of finding a true ruler, are willing to acquiesce in any law or custom which will save them from the caprice of individuals.</div><div class="sentence"> They are ready to accept any of the six forms of government which prevail in the world.</div><div class="sentence"> To the Greek, nomos was a sacred word, but the political idealism of Plato soars into a region beyond; for the laws he would substitute the intelligent will of the legislator.</div><div class="sentence"> Education is originally to implant in men's minds a sense of truth and justice, which is the divine bond of states, and the legislator is to contrive human bonds, by which dissimilar natures may be united in marriage and supply the deficiencies of one another.</div><div class="sentence"> As in the Republic, the government of philosophers, the causes of the perversion of states, the regulation of marriages, are still the political problems with which Plato's mind is occupied.</div><div class="sentence"> He treats them more slightly, partly because the dialogue is shorter, and also because the discussion of them is perpetually crossed by the other interest of dialectic, which has begun to absorb him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  The plan of the Politicus or Statesman may be briefly sketched as follows: (1) By a process of division and subdivision we discover the true herdsman or king of men.</div><div class="sentence"> But before we can rightly distinguish him from his rivals, we must view him, (2) as he is presented to us in a famous ancient tale: the tale will also enable us to distinguish the divine from the human herdsman or shepherd: (3) and besides our fable, we must have an example; for our example we will select the art of weaving, which will have to be distinguished from the kindred arts; and then, following this pattern, we will separate the king from his subordinates or competitors.</div><div class="sentence"> (4) But are we not exceeding all due limits; and is there not a measure of all arts and sciences, to which the art of discourse must conform?</div><div class="sentence"> There is; but before we can apply this measure, we must know what is the aim of discourse: and our discourse only aims at the dialectical improvement of ourselves and others.—Having made our apology, we return once more to the king or statesman, and proceed to contrast him with pretenders in the same line with him, under their various forms of government.</div><div class="sentence"> (5) His characteristic is, that he alone has science, which is superior to law and written enactments; these do but spring out of the necessities of mankind, when they are in despair of finding the true king.</div><div class="sentence"> (6) The sciences which are most akin to the royal are the sciences of the general, the judge, the orator, which minister to him, but even these are subordinate to him.</div><div class="sentence"> (7) Fixed principles are implanted by education, and the king or statesman completes the political web by marrying together dissimilar natures, the courageous and the temperate, the bold and the gentle, who are the warp and the woof of society.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  The outline may be filled up as follows:—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I have reason to thank you, Theodorus, for the acquaintance of Theaetetus and the Stranger.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  And you will have three times as much reason to thank me when they have delineated the Statesman and Philosopher, as well as the Sophist.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Does the great geometrician apply the same measure to all three?</div><div class="sentence"> Are they not divided by an interval which no geometrical ratio can express?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span><div class="speaker">THEODORUS</div><div class="sentence">  By the god Ammon, Socrates, you are right; and I am glad to see that you have not forgotten your geometry.</div><div class="sentence"> But before I retaliate on you, I must request the Stranger to finish the argument...</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span> <div class="sentence">  The Stranger suggests that Theaetetus shall be allowed to rest, and that Socrates the younger shall respond in his place; Theodorus agrees to the suggestion, and Socrates remarks that the name of the one and the face of the other give him a right to claim relationship with both of them.</div><div class="sentence"> They propose to take the Statesman after the Sophist; his path they must determine, and part off all other ways, stamping upon them a single negative form (compare Soph.</div><div class="sentence"> ).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span> <div class="sentence">  The Stranger begins the enquiry by making a division of the arts and sciences into theoretical and practical—the one kind concerned with knowledge exclusively, and the other with action; arithmetic and the mathematical sciences are examples of the former, and carpentering and handicraft arts of the latter (compare Philebus).</div><div class="sentence"> Under which of the two shall we place the Statesman?</div><div class="sentence"> Or rather, shall we not first ask, whether the king, statesman, master, householder, practise one art or many?</div><div class="sentence"> As the adviser of a physician may be said to have medical science and to be a physician, so the adviser of a king has royal science and is a king.</div><div class="sentence"> And the master of a large household may be compared to the ruler of a small state.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence we conclude that the science of the king, statesman, and householder is one and the same.</div><div class="sentence"> And this science is akin to knowledge rather than to action.</div><div class="sentence"> For a king rules with his mind, and not with his hands.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span> <div class="sentence">  But theoretical science may be a science either of judging, like arithmetic, or of ruling and superintending, like that of the architect or master-builder.</div><div class="sentence"> And the science of the king is of the latter nature; but the power which he exercises is underived and uncontrolled,—a characteristic which distinguishes him from heralds, prophets, and other inferior officers.</div><div class="sentence"> He is the wholesale dealer in command, and the herald, or other officer, retails his commands to others.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, a ruler is concerned with the production of some object, and objects may be divided into living and lifeless, and rulers into the rulers of living and lifeless objects.</div><div class="sentence"> And the king is not like the master-builder, concerned with lifeless matter, but has the task of managing living animals.</div><div class="sentence"> And the tending of living animals may be either a tending of individuals, or a managing of herds.</div><div class="sentence"> And the Statesman is not a groom, but a herdsman, and his art may be called either the art of managing a herd, or the art of collective management:—Which do you prefer?</div><div class="sentence"> 'No matter.'</div><div class="sentence"> Very good, Socrates, and if you are not too particular about words you will be all the richer some day in true wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> But how would you subdivide the herdsman's art?</div><div class="sentence"> 'I should say, that there is one management of men, and another of beasts.'</div><div class="sentence"> Very good, but you are in too great a hurry to get to man.</div><div class="sentence"> All divisions which are rightly made should cut through the middle; if you attend to this rule, you will be more likely to arrive at classes.</div><div class="sentence"> 'I do not understand the nature of my mistake.'</div><div class="sentence"> Your division was like a division of the human race into Hellenes and Barbarians, or into Lydians or Phrygians and all other nations, instead of into male and female; or like a division of number into ten thousand and all other numbers, instead of into odd and even.</div><div class="sentence"> And I should like you to observe further, that though I maintain a class to be a part, there is no similar necessity for a part to be a class.</div><div class="sentence"> But to return to your division, you spoke of men and other animals as two classes—the second of which you comprehended under the general name of beasts.</div><div class="sentence"> This is the sort of division which an intelligent crane would make: he would put cranes into a class by themselves for their special glory, and jumble together all others, including man, in the class of beasts.</div><div class="sentence"> An error of this kind can only be avoided by a more regular subdivision.</div><div class="sentence"> Just now we divided the whole class of animals into gregarious and non-gregarious, omitting the previous division into tame and wild.</div><div class="sentence"> We forgot this in our hurry to arrive at man, and found by experience, as the proverb says, that 'the more haste the worse speed.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span> <div class="sentence">  And now let us begin again at the art of managing herds.</div><div class="sentence"> You have probably heard of the fish-preserves in the Nile and in the ponds of the Great King, and of the nurseries of geese and cranes in Thessaly.</div><div class="sentence"> These suggest a new division into the rearing or management of land-herds and of water-herds:—I need not say with which the king is concerned.</div><div class="sentence"> And land-herds may be divided into walking and flying; and every idiot knows that the political animal is a pedestrian.</div><div class="sentence"> At this point we may take a longer or a shorter road, and as we are already near the end, I see no harm in taking the longer, which is the way of mesotomy, and accords with the principle which we were laying down.</div><div class="sentence"> The tame, walking, herding animal, may be divided into two classes—the horned and the hornless, and the king is concerned with the hornless; and these again may be subdivided into animals having or not having cloven feet, or mixing or not mixing the breed; and the king or statesman has the care of animals which have not cloven feet, and which do not mix the breed.</div><div class="sentence"> And now, if we omit dogs, who can hardly be said to herd, I think that we have only two species left which remain undivided: and how are we to distinguish them?</div><div class="sentence"> To geometricians, like you and Theaetetus, I can have no difficulty in explaining that man is a diameter, having a power of two feet; and the power of four-legged creatures, being the double of two feet, is the diameter of our diameter.</div><div class="sentence"> There is another excellent jest which I spy in the two remaining species.</div><div class="sentence"> Men and birds are both bipeds, and human beings are running a race with the airiest and freest of creation, in which they are far behind their competitors;—this is a great joke, and there is a still better in the juxtaposition of the bird-taker and the king, who may be seen scampering after them.</div><div class="sentence"> For, as we remarked in discussing the Sophist, the dialectical method is no respecter of persons.</div><div class="sentence"> But we might have proceeded, as I was saying, by another and a shorter road.</div><div class="sentence"> In that case we should have begun by dividing land animals into bipeds and quadrupeds, and bipeds into winged and wingless; we should than have taken the Statesman and set him over the 'bipes implume,' and put the reins of government into his hands.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span> <div class="sentence">  Here let us sum up:—The science of pure knowledge had a part which was the science of command, and this had a part which was a science of wholesale command; and this was divided into the management of animals, and was again parted off into the management of herds of animals, and again of land animals, and these into hornless, and these into bipeds; and so at last we arrived at man, and found the political and royal science.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet we have not clearly distinguished the political shepherd from his rivals.</div><div class="sentence"> No one would think of usurping the prerogatives of the ordinary shepherd, who on all hands is admitted to be the trainer, matchmaker, doctor, musician of his flock.</div><div class="sentence"> But the royal shepherd has numberless competitors, from whom he must be distinguished; there are merchants, husbandmen, physicians, who will all dispute his right to manage the flock.</div><div class="sentence"> I think that we can best distinguish him by having recourse to a famous old tradition, which may amuse as well as instruct us; the narrative is perfectly true, although the scepticism of mankind is prone to doubt the tales of old.</div><div class="sentence"> You have heard what happened in the quarrel of Atreus and Thyestes?</div><div class="sentence"> 'You mean about the golden lamb?'</div><div class="sentence"> No, not that; but another part of the story, which tells how the sun and stars once arose in the west and set in the east, and that the god reversed their motion, as a witness to the right of Atreus.</div><div class="sentence"> 'There is such a story.'</div><div class="sentence"> And no doubt you have heard of the empire of Cronos, and of the earthborn men?</div><div class="sentence"> The origin of these and the like stories is to be found in the tale which I am about to narrate.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span> <div class="sentence">  There was a time when God directed the revolutions of the world, but at the completion of a certain cycle he let go; and the world, by a necessity of its nature, turned back, and went round the other way.</div><div class="sentence"> For divine things alone are unchangeable; but the earth and heavens, although endowed with many glories, have a body, and are therefore liable to perturbation.</div><div class="sentence"> In the case of the world, the perturbation is very slight, and amounts only to a reversal of motion.</div><div class="sentence"> For the lord of moving things is alone self-moved; neither can piety allow that he goes at one time in one direction and at another time in another; or that God has given the universe opposite motions; or that there are two gods, one turning it in one direction, another in another.</div><div class="sentence"> But the truth is, that there are two cycles of the world, and in one of them it is governed by an immediate Providence, and receives life and immortality, and in the other is let go again, and has a reverse action during infinite ages.</div><div class="sentence"> This new action is spontaneous, and is due to exquisite perfection of balance, to the vast size of the universe, and to the smallness of the pivot upon which it turns.</div><div class="sentence"> All changes in the heaven affect the animal world, and this being the greatest of them, is most destructive to men and animals.</div><div class="sentence"> At the beginning of the cycle before our own very few of them had survived; and on these a mighty change passed.</div><div class="sentence"> For their life was reversed like the motion of the world, and first of all coming to a stand then quickly returned to youth and beauty.</div><div class="sentence"> The white locks of the aged became black; the cheeks of the bearded man were restored to their youth and fineness; the young men grew softer and smaller, and, being reduced to the condition of children in mind as well as body, began to vanish away; and the bodies of those who had died by violence, in a few moments underwent a parallel change and disappeared.</div><div class="sentence"> In that cycle of existence there was no such thing as the procreation of animals from one another, but they were born of the earth, and of this our ancestors, who came into being immediately after the end of the last cycle and at the beginning of this, have preserved the recollection.</div><div class="sentence"> Such traditions are often now unduly discredited, and yet they may be proved by internal evidence.</div><div class="sentence"> For observe how consistent the narrative is; as the old returned to youth, so the dead returned to life; the wheel of their existence having been reversed, they rose again from the earth: a few only were reserved by God for another destiny.</div><div class="sentence"> Such was the origin of the earthborn men.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span> <div class="sentence">  'And is this cycle, of which you are speaking, the reign of Cronos, or our present state of existence?'</div><div class="sentence"> No, Socrates, that blessed and spontaneous life belongs not to this, but to the previous state, in which God was the governor of the whole world, and other gods subject to him ruled over parts of the world, as is still the case in certain places.</div><div class="sentence"> They were shepherds of men and animals, each of them sufficing for those of whom he had the care.</div><div class="sentence"> And there was no violence among them, or war, or devouring of one another.</div><div class="sentence"> Their life was spontaneous, because in those days God ruled over man; and he was to man what man is now to the animals.</div><div class="sentence"> Under his government there were no estates, or private possessions, or families; but the earth produced a sufficiency of all things, and men were born out of the earth, having no traditions of the past; and as the temperature of the seasons was mild, they took no thought for raiment, and had no beds, but lived and dwelt in the open air.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span> <div class="sentence">  Such was the age of Cronos, and the age of Zeus is our own.</div><div class="sentence"> Tell me, which is the happier of the two?</div><div class="sentence"> Or rather, shall I tell you that the happiness of these children of Cronos must have depended on how they used their time?</div><div class="sentence"> If having boundless leisure, and the power of discoursing not only with one another but with the animals, they had employed these advantages with a view to philosophy, gathering from every nature some addition to their store of knowledge;—or again, if they had merely eaten and drunk, and told stories to one another, and to the beasts;—in either case, I say, there would be no difficulty in answering the question.</div><div class="sentence"> But as nobody knows which they did, the question must remain unanswered.</div><div class="sentence"> And here is the point of my tale.</div><div class="sentence"> In the fulness of time, when the earthborn men had all passed away, the ruler of the universe let go the helm, and became a spectator; and destiny and natural impulse swayed the world.</div><div class="sentence"> At the same instant all the inferior deities gave up their hold; the whole universe rebounded, and there was a great earthquake, and utter ruin of all manner of animals.</div><div class="sentence"> After a while the tumult ceased, and the universal creature settled down in his accustomed course, having authority over all other creatures, and following the instructions of his God and Father, at first more precisely, afterwards with less exactness.</div><div class="sentence"> The reason of the falling off was the disengagement of a former chaos; 'a muddy vesture of decay' was a part of his original nature, out of which he was brought by his Creator, under whose immediate guidance, while he remained in that former cycle, the evil was minimized and the good increased to the utmost.</div><div class="sentence"> And in the beginning of the new cycle all was well enough, but as time went on, discord entered in; at length the good was minimized and the evil everywhere diffused, and there was a danger of universal ruin.</div><div class="sentence"> Then the Creator, seeing the world in great straits, and fearing that chaos and infinity would come again, in his tender care again placed himself at the helm and restored order, and made the world immortal and imperishable.</div><div class="sentence"> Once more the cycle of life and generation was reversed; the infants grew into young men, and the young men became greyheaded; no longer did the animals spring out of the earth; as the whole world was now lord of its own progress, so the parts were to be self-created and self-nourished.</div><div class="sentence"> At first the case of men was very helpless and pitiable; for they were alone among the wild beasts, and had to carry on the struggle for existence without arts or knowledge, and had no food, and did not know how to get any.</div><div class="sentence"> That was the time when Prometheus brought them fire, Hephaestus and Athene taught them arts, and other gods gave them seeds and plants.</div><div class="sentence"> Out of these human life was framed; for mankind were left to themselves, and ordered their own ways, living, like the universe, in one cycle after one manner, and in another cycle after another manner.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">040</span> <div class="sentence">  The greater interest of the myth consists in the philosophical lessons which Plato presents to us in this veiled form.</div><div class="sentence"> Here, as in the tale of Er, the son of Armenius, he touches upon the question of freedom and necessity, both in relation to God and nature.</div><div class="sentence"> For at first the universe is governed by the immediate providence of God,—this is the golden age,—but after a while the wheel is reversed, and man is left to himself.</div><div class="sentence"> Like other theologians and philosophers, Plato relegates his explanation of the problem to a transcendental world; he speaks of what in modern language might be termed 'impossibilities in the nature of things,' hindering God from continuing immanent in the world.</div><div class="sentence"> But there is some inconsistency; for the 'letting go' is spoken of as a divine act, and is at the same time attributed to the necessary imperfection of matter; there is also a numerical necessity for the successive births of souls.</div><div class="sentence"> At first, man and the world retain their divine instincts, but gradually degenerate.</div><div class="sentence"> As in the Book of Genesis, the first fall of man is succeeded by a second; the misery and wickedness of the world increase continually.</div><div class="sentence"> The reason of this further decline is supposed to be the disorganisation of matter: the latent seeds of a former chaos are disengaged, and envelope all things.</div><div class="sentence"> The condition of man becomes more and more miserable; he is perpetually waging an unequal warfare with the beasts.</div><div class="sentence"> At length he obtains such a measure of education and help as is necessary for his existence.</div><div class="sentence"> Though deprived of God's help, he is not left wholly destitute; he has received from Athene and Hephaestus a knowledge of the arts; other gods give him seeds and plants; and out of these human life is reconstructed.</div><div class="sentence"> He now eats bread in the sweat of his brow, and has dominion over the animals, subjected to the conditions of his nature, and yet able to cope with them by divine help.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus Plato may be said to represent in a figure—(1) the state of innocence; (2) the fall of man; (3) the still deeper decline into barbarism; (4) the restoration of man by the partial interference of God, and the natural growth of the arts and of civilised society.</div><div class="sentence"> Two lesser features of this description should not pass unnoticed:—(1) the primitive men are supposed to be created out of the earth, and not after the ordinary manner of human generation—half the causes of moral evil are in this way removed; (2) the arts are attributed to a divine revelation: and so the greatest difficulty in the history of pre-historic man is solved.</div><div class="sentence"> Though no one knew better than Plato that the introduction of the gods is not a reason, but an excuse for not giving a reason (Cratylus), yet, considering that more than two thousand years later mankind are still discussing these problems, we may be satisfied to find in Plato a statement of the difficulties which arise in conceiving the relation of man to God and nature, without expecting to obtain from him a solution of them.</div><div class="sentence"> In such a tale, as in the Phaedrus, various aspects of the Ideas were doubtless indicated to Plato's own mind, as the corresponding theological problems are to us.</div><div class="sentence"> The immanence of things in the Ideas, or the partial separation of them, and the self-motion of the supreme Idea, are probably the forms in which he would have interpreted his own parable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span> <div class="sentence">  He touches upon another question of great interest—the consciousness of evil—what in the Jewish Scriptures is called 'eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.'</div><div class="sentence"> At the end of the narrative, the Eleatic asks his companion whether this life of innocence, or that which men live at present, is the better of the two.</div><div class="sentence"> He wants to distinguish between the mere animal life of innocence, the 'city of pigs,' as it is comically termed by Glaucon in the Republic, and the higher life of reason and philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> But as no one can determine the state of man in the world before the Fall, 'the question must remain unanswered.'</div><div class="sentence"> Similar questions have occupied the minds of theologians in later ages; but they can hardly be said to have found an answer.</div><div class="sentence"> Professor Campbell well observes, that the general spirit of the myth may be summed up in the words of the Lysis: 'If evil were to perish, should we hunger any more, or thirst any more, or have any similar sensations?</div><div class="sentence"> Yet perhaps the question what will or will not be is a foolish one, for who can tell?'</div><div class="sentence"> As in the Theaetetus, evil is supposed to continue,—here, as the consequence of a former state of the world, a sort of mephitic vapour exhaling from some ancient chaos,—there, as involved in the possibility of good, and incident to the mixed state of man.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span> <div class="sentence">  Once more—and this is the point of connexion with the rest of the dialogue—the myth is intended to bring out the difference between the ideal and the actual state of man.</div><div class="sentence"> In all ages of the world men have dreamed of a state of perfection, which has been, and is to be, but never is, and seems to disappear under the necessary conditions of human society.</div><div class="sentence"> The uselessness, the danger, the true value of such political ideals have often been discussed; youth is too ready to believe in them; age to disparage them.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato's 'prudens quaestio' respecting the comparative happiness of men in this and in a former cycle of existence is intended to elicit this contrast between the golden age and 'the life under Zeus' which is our own.</div><div class="sentence"> To confuse the divine and human, or hastily apply one to the other, is a 'tremendous error.'</div><div class="sentence"> Of the ideal or divine government of the world we can form no true or adequate conception; and this our mixed state of life, in which we are partly left to ourselves, but not wholly deserted by the gods, may contain some higher elements of good and knowledge than could have existed in the days of innocence under the rule of Cronos.</div><div class="sentence"> So we may venture slightly to enlarge a Platonic thought which admits of a further application to Christian theology.</div><div class="sentence"> Here are suggested also the distinctions between God causing and permitting evil, and between his more and less immediate government of the world.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">043</span> <div class="sentence">  II.</div><div class="sentence"> The dialectical interest of the Statesman seems to contend in Plato's mind with the political; the dialogue might have been designated by two equally descriptive titles—either the 'Statesman,' or 'Concerning Method.'</div><div class="sentence"> Dialectic, which in the earlier writings of Plato is a revival of the Socratic question and answer applied to definition, is now occupied with classification; there is nothing in which he takes greater delight than in processes of division (compare Phaedr.</div><div class="sentence"> ); he pursues them to a length out of proportion to his main subject, and appears to value them as a dialectical exercise, and for their own sake.</div><div class="sentence"> A poetical vision of some order or hierarchy of ideas or sciences has already been floating before us in the Symposium and the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> And in the Phaedrus this aspect of dialectic is further sketched out, and the art of rhetoric is based on the division of the characters of mankind into their several classes.</div><div class="sentence"> The same love of divisions is apparent in the Gorgias.</div><div class="sentence"> But in a well-known passage of the Philebus occurs the first criticism on the nature of classification.</div><div class="sentence"> There we are exhorted not to fall into the common error of passing from unity to infinity, but to find the intermediate classes; and we are reminded that in any process of generalization, there may be more than one class to which individuals may be referred, and that we must carry on the process of division until we have arrived at the infima species.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">044</span> <div class="sentence">  These precepts are not forgotten, either in the Sophist or in the Statesman.</div><div class="sentence"> The Sophist contains four examples of division, carried on by regular steps, until in four different lines of descent we detect the Sophist.</div><div class="sentence"> In the Statesman the king or statesman is discovered by a similar process; and we have a summary, probably made for the first time, of possessions appropriated by the labour of man, which are distributed into seven classes.</div><div class="sentence"> We are warned against preferring the shorter to the longer method;—if we divide in the middle, we are most likely to light upon species; at the same time, the important remark is made, that 'a part is not to be confounded with a class.'</div><div class="sentence"> Having discovered the genus under which the king falls, we proceed to distinguish him from the collateral species.</div><div class="sentence"> To assist our imagination in making this separation, we require an example.</div><div class="sentence"> The higher ideas, of which we have a dreamy knowledge, can only be represented by images taken from the external world.</div><div class="sentence"> But, first of all, the nature of example is explained by an example.</div><div class="sentence"> The child is taught to read by comparing the letters in words which he knows with the same letters in unknown combinations; and this is the sort of process which we are about to attempt.</div><div class="sentence"> As a parallel to the king we select the worker in wool, and compare the art of weaving with the royal science, trying to separate either of them from the inferior classes to which they are akin.</div><div class="sentence"> This has the incidental advantage, that weaving and the web furnish us with a figure of speech, which we can afterwards transfer to the State.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span> <div class="sentence">  There are two uses of examples or images—in the first place, they suggest thoughts—secondly, they give them a distinct form.</div><div class="sentence"> In the infancy of philosophy, as in childhood, the language of pictures is natural to man: truth in the abstract is hardly won, and only by use familiarized to the mind.</div><div class="sentence"> Examples are akin to analogies, and have a reflex influence on thought; they people the vacant mind, and may often originate new directions of enquiry.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato seems to be conscious of the suggestiveness of imagery; the general analogy of the arts is constantly employed by him as well as the comparison of particular arts—weaving, the refining of gold, the learning to read, music, statuary, painting, medicine, the art of the pilot—all of which occur in this dialogue alone: though he is also aware that 'comparisons are slippery things,' and may often give a false clearness to ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> We shall find, in the Philebus, a division of sciences into practical and speculative, and into more or less speculative: here we have the idea of master-arts, or sciences which control inferior ones.</div><div class="sentence"> Besides the supreme science of dialectic, 'which will forget us, if we forget her,' another master-science for the first time appears in view—the science of government, which fixes the limits of all the rest.</div><div class="sentence"> This conception of the political or royal science as, from another point of view, the science of sciences, which holds sway over the rest, is not originally found in Aristotle, but in Plato.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">046</span> <div class="sentence">  The doctrine that virtue and art are in a mean, which is familiarized to us by the study of the Nicomachean Ethics, is also first distinctly asserted in the Statesman of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> The too much and the too little are in restless motion: they must be fixed by a mean, which is also a standard external to them.</div><div class="sentence"> The art of measuring or finding a mean between excess and defect, like the principle of division in the Phaedrus, receives a particular application to the art of discourse.</div><div class="sentence"> The excessive length of a discourse may be blamed; but who can say what is excess, unless he is furnished with a measure or standard?</div><div class="sentence"> Measure is the life of the arts, and may some day be discovered to be the single ultimate principle in which all the sciences are contained.</div><div class="sentence"> Other forms of thought may be noted—the distinction between causal and co-operative arts, which may be compared with the distinction between primary and co-operative causes in the Timaeus; or between cause and condition in the Phaedo; the passing mention of economical science; the opposition of rest and motion, which is found in all nature; the general conception of two great arts of composition and division, in which are contained weaving, politics, dialectic; and in connexion with the conception of a mean, the two arts of measuring.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">047</span> <div class="sentence">  In the Theaetetus, Plato remarks that precision in the use of terms, though sometimes pedantic, is sometimes necessary.</div><div class="sentence"> Here he makes the opposite reflection, that there may be a philosophical disregard of words.</div><div class="sentence"> The evil of mere verbal oppositions, the requirement of an impossible accuracy in the use of terms, the error of supposing that philosophy was to be found in language, the danger of word-catching, have frequently been discussed by him in the previous dialogues, but nowhere has the spirit of modern inductive philosophy been more happily indicated than in the words of the Statesman:—'If you think more about things, and less about words, you will be richer in wisdom as you grow older.'</div><div class="sentence"> A similar spirit is discernible in the remarkable expressions, 'the long and difficult language of facts;' and 'the interrogation of every nature, in order to obtain the particular contribution of each to the store of knowledge.'</div><div class="sentence"> Who has described 'the feeble intelligence of all things; given by metaphysics better than the Eleatic Stranger in the words—'The higher ideas can hardly be set forth except through the medium of examples; every man seems to know all things in a kind of dream, and then again nothing when he is awake?'</div><div class="sentence"> Or where is the value of metaphysical pursuits more truly expressed than in the words,—'The greatest and noblest things have no outward image of themselves visible to man: therefore we should learn to give a rational account of them?'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">048</span> <div class="sentence">  III.</div><div class="sentence"> The political aspects of the dialogue are closely connected with the dialectical.</div><div class="sentence"> As in the Cratylus, the legislator has 'the dialectician standing on his right hand;' so in the Statesman, the king or statesman is the dialectician, who, although he may be in a private station, is still a king.</div><div class="sentence"> Whether he has the power or not, is a mere accident; or rather he has the power, for what ought to be is ('Was ist vernunftig, das ist wirklich'); and he ought to be and is the true governor of mankind.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a reflection in this idealism of the Socratic 'Virtue is knowledge;' and, without idealism, we may remark that knowledge is a great part of power.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato does not trouble himself to construct a machinery by which 'philosophers shall be made kings,' as in the Republic: he merely holds up the ideal, and affirms that in some sense science is really supreme over human life.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">049</span> <div class="sentence">  He is struck by the observation 'quam parva sapientia regitur mundus,' and is touched with a feeling of the ills which afflict states.</div><div class="sentence"> The condition of Megara before and during the Peloponnesian War, of Athens under the Thirty and afterwards, of Syracuse and the other Sicilian cities in their alternations of democratic excess and tyranny, might naturally suggest such reflections.</div><div class="sentence"> Some states he sees already shipwrecked, others foundering for want of a pilot; and he wonders not at their destruction, but at their endurance.</div><div class="sentence"> For they ought to have perished long ago, if they had depended on the wisdom of their rulers.</div><div class="sentence"> The mingled pathos and satire of this remark is characteristic of Plato's later style.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">050</span> <div class="sentence">  The king is the personification of political science.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet he is something more than this,—the perfectly good and wise tyrant of the Laws, whose will is better than any law.</div><div class="sentence"> He is the special providence who is always interfering with and regulating all things.</div><div class="sentence"> Such a conception has sometimes been entertained by modern theologians, and by Plato himself, of the Supreme Being.</div><div class="sentence"> But whether applied to Divine or to human governors the conception is faulty for two reasons, neither of which are noticed by Plato:—first, because all good government supposes a degree of co-operation in the ruler and his subjects,—an 'education in politics' as well as in moral virtue; secondly, because government, whether Divine or human, implies that the subject has a previous knowledge of the rules under which he is living.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a fallacy, too, in comparing unchangeable laws with a personal governor.</div><div class="sentence"> For the law need not necessarily be an 'ignorant and brutal tyrant,' but gentle and humane, capable of being altered in the spirit of the legislator, and of being administered so as to meet the cases of individuals.</div><div class="sentence"> Not only in fact, but in idea, both elements must remain—the fixed law and the living will; the written word and the spirit; the principles of obligation and of freedom; and their applications whether made by law or equity in particular cases.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span> <div class="sentence">  There are two sides from which positive laws may be attacked:—either from the side of nature, which rises up and rebels against them in the spirit of Callicles in the Gorgias; or from the side of idealism, which attempts to soar above them,—and this is the spirit of Plato in the Statesman.</div><div class="sentence"> But he soon falls, like Icarus, and is content to walk instead of flying; that is, to accommodate himself to the actual state of human things.</div><div class="sentence"> Mankind have long been in despair of finding the true ruler; and therefore are ready to acquiesce in any of the five or six received forms of government as better than none.</div><div class="sentence"> And the best thing which they can do (though only the second best in reality), is to reduce the ideal state to the conditions of actual life.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus in the Statesman, as in the Laws, we have three forms of government, which we may venture to term, (1) the ideal, (2) the practical, (3) the sophistical—what ought to be, what might be, what is.</div><div class="sentence"> And thus Plato seems to stumble, almost by accident, on the notion of a constitutional monarchy, or of a monarchy ruling by laws.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span> <div class="sentence">  The divine foundations of a State are to be laid deep in education (Republic), and at the same time some little violence may be used in exterminating natures which are incapable of education (compare Laws).</div><div class="sentence"> Plato is strongly of opinion that the legislator, like the physician, may do men good against their will (compare Gorgias).</div><div class="sentence"> The human bonds of states are formed by the inter-marriage of dispositions adapted to supply the defects of each other.</div><div class="sentence"> As in the Republic, Plato has observed that there are opposite natures in the world, the strong and the gentle, the courageous and the temperate, which, borrowing an expression derived from the image of weaving, he calls the warp and the woof of human society.</div><div class="sentence"> To interlace these is the crowning achievement of political science.</div><div class="sentence"> In the Protagoras, Socrates was maintaining that there was only one virtue, and not many: now Plato is inclined to think that there are not only parallel, but opposite virtues, and seems to see a similar opposition pervading all art and nature.</div><div class="sentence"> But he is satisfied with laying down the principle, and does not inform us by what further steps the union of opposites is to be effected.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span> <div class="sentence">  In the loose framework of a single dialogue Plato has thus combined two distinct subjects—politics and method.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet they are not so far apart as they appear: in his own mind there was a secret link of connexion between them.</div><div class="sentence"> For the philosopher or dialectician is also the only true king or statesman.</div><div class="sentence"> In the execution of his plan Plato has invented or distinguished several important forms of thought, and made incidentally many valuable remarks.</div><div class="sentence"> Questions of interest both in ancient and modern politics also arise in the course of the dialogue, which may with advantage be further considered by us:—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span> <div class="sentence">  a.</div><div class="sentence"> The imaginary ruler, whether God or man, is above the law, and is a law to himself and to others.</div><div class="sentence"> Among the Greeks as among the Jews, law was a sacred name, the gift of God, the bond of states.</div><div class="sentence"> But in the Statesman of Plato, as in the New Testament, the word has also become the symbol of an imperfect good, which is almost an evil.</div><div class="sentence"> The law sacrifices the individual to the universal, and is the tyranny of the many over the few (compare Republic).</div><div class="sentence"> It has fixed rules which are the props of order, and will not swerve or bend in extreme cases.</div><div class="sentence"> It is the beginning of political society, but there is something higher—an intelligent ruler, whether God or man, who is able to adapt himself to the endless varieties of circumstances.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato is fond of picturing the advantages which would result from the union of the tyrant who has power with the legislator who has wisdom: he regards this as the best and speediest way of reforming mankind.</div><div class="sentence"> But institutions cannot thus be artificially created, nor can the external authority of a ruler impose laws for which a nation is unprepared.</div><div class="sentence"> The greatest power, the highest wisdom, can only proceed one or two steps in advance of public opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> In all stages of civilization human nature, after all our efforts, remains intractable,—not like clay in the hands of the potter, or marble under the chisel of the sculptor.</div><div class="sentence"> Great changes occur in the history of nations, but they are brought about slowly, like the changes in the frame of nature, upon which the puny arm of man hardly makes an impression.</div><div class="sentence"> And, speaking generally, the slowest growths, both in nature and in politics, are the most permanent.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span> <div class="sentence">  b.</div><div class="sentence"> Whether the best form of the ideal is a person or a law may fairly be doubted.</div><div class="sentence"> The former is more akin to us: it clothes itself in poetry and art, and appeals to reason more in the form of feeling: in the latter there is less danger of allowing ourselves to be deluded by a figure of speech.</div><div class="sentence"> The ideal of the Greek state found an expression in the deification of law: the ancient Stoic spoke of a wise man perfect in virtue, who was fancifully said to be a king; but neither they nor Plato had arrived at the conception of a person who was also a law.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor is it easy for the Christian to think of God as wisdom, truth, holiness, and also as the wise, true, and holy one.</div><div class="sentence"> He is always wanting to break through the abstraction and interrupt the law, in order that he may present to himself the more familiar image of a divine friend.</div><div class="sentence"> While the impersonal has too slender a hold upon the affections to be made the basis of religion, the conception of a person on the other hand tends to degenerate into a new kind of idolatry.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither criticism nor experience allows us to suppose that there are interferences with the laws of nature; the idea is inconceivable to us and at variance with facts.</div><div class="sentence"> The philosopher or theologian who could realize to mankind that a person is a law, that the higher rule has no exception, that goodness, like knowledge, is also power, would breathe a new religious life into the world.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span> <div class="sentence">  The other consideration is of an opposite kind.</div><div class="sentence"> Admitting that a few wise men are likely to be better governors than the unwise many, yet it is not in their power to fashion an entire people according to their behest.</div><div class="sentence"> When with the best intentions the benevolent despot begins his regime, he finds the world hard to move.</div><div class="sentence"> A succession of good kings has at the end of a century left the people an inert and unchanged mass.</div><div class="sentence"> The Roman world was not permanently improved by the hundred years of Hadrian and the Antonines.</div><div class="sentence"> The kings of Spain during the last century were at least equal to any contemporary sovereigns in virtue and ability.</div><div class="sentence"> In certain states of the world the means are wanting to render a benevolent power effectual.</div><div class="sentence"> These means are not a mere external organisation of posts or telegraphs, hardly the introduction of new laws or modes of industry.</div><div class="sentence"> A change must be made in the spirit of a people as well as in their externals.</div><div class="sentence"> The ancient legislator did not really take a blank tablet and inscribe upon it the rules which reflection and experience had taught him to be for a nation's interest; no one would have obeyed him if he had.</div><div class="sentence"> But he took the customs which he found already existing in a half-civilised state of society: these he reduced to form and inscribed on pillars; he defined what had before been undefined, and gave certainty to what was uncertain.</div><div class="sentence"> No legislation ever sprang, like Athene, in full power out of the head either of God or man.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span> <div class="sentence">  Plato and Aristotle are sensible of the difficulty of combining the wisdom of the few with the power of the many.</div><div class="sentence"> According to Plato, he is a physician who has the knowledge of a physician, and he is a king who has the knowledge of a king.</div><div class="sentence"> But how the king, one or more, is to obtain the required power, is hardly at all considered by him.</div><div class="sentence"> He presents the idea of a perfect government, but except the regulation for mixing different tempers in marriage, he never makes any provision for the attainment of it.</div><div class="sentence"> Aristotle, casting aside ideals, would place the government in a middle class of citizens, sufficiently numerous for stability, without admitting the populace; and such appears to have been the constitution which actually prevailed for a short time at Athens—the rule of the Five Thousand—characterized by Thucydides as the best government of Athens which he had known.</div><div class="sentence"> It may however be doubted how far, either in a Greek or modern state, such a limitation is practicable or desirable; for those who are left outside the pale will always be dangerous to those who are within, while on the other hand the leaven of the mob can hardly affect the representation of a great country.</div><div class="sentence"> There is reason for the argument in favour of a property qualification; there is reason also in the arguments of those who would include all and so exhaust the political situation.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span> <div class="sentence">  d. Law is the first principle of society, but it cannot supply all the wants of society, and may easily cause more evils than it cures.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato is aware of the imperfection of law in failing to meet the varieties of circumstances: he is also aware that human life would be intolerable if every detail of it were placed under legal regulation.</div><div class="sentence"> It may be a great evil that physicians should kill their patients or captains cast away their ships, but it would be a far greater evil if each particular in the practice of medicine or seamanship were regulated by law.</div><div class="sentence"> Much has been said in modern times about the duty of leaving men to themselves, which is supposed to be the best way of taking care of them.</div><div class="sentence"> The question is often asked, What are the limits of legislation in relation to morals?</div><div class="sentence"> And the answer is to the same effect, that morals must take care of themselves.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a one-sided truth in these answers, if they are regarded as condemnations of the interference with commerce in the last century or of clerical persecution in the Middle Ages.</div><div class="sentence"> But 'laissez-faire' is not the best but only the second best.</div><div class="sentence"> What the best is, Plato does not attempt to determine; he only contrasts the imperfection of law with the wisdom of the perfect ruler.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span> <div class="sentence">  Laws should be just, but they must also be certain, and we are obliged to sacrifice something of their justice to their certainty.</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose a wise and good judge, who paying little or no regard to the law, attempted to decide with perfect justice the cases that were brought before him.</div><div class="sentence"> To the uneducated person he would appear to be the ideal of a judge.</div><div class="sentence"> Such justice has been often exercised in primitive times, or at the present day among eastern rulers.</div><div class="sentence"> But in the first place it depends entirely on the personal character of the judge.</div><div class="sentence"> He may be honest, but there is no check upon his dishonesty, and his opinion can only be overruled, not by any principle of law, but by the opinion of another judging like himself without law.</div><div class="sentence"> In the second place, even if he be ever so honest, his mode of deciding questions would introduce an element of uncertainty into human life; no one would know beforehand what would happen to him, or would seek to conform in his conduct to any rule of law.</div><div class="sentence"> For the compact which the law makes with men, that they shall be protected if they observe the law in their dealings with one another, would have to be substituted another principle of a more general character, that they shall be protected by the law if they act rightly in their dealings with one another.</div><div class="sentence"> The complexity of human actions and also the uncertainty of their effects would be increased tenfold.</div><div class="sentence"> For one of the principal advantages of law is not merely that it enforces honesty, but that it makes men act in the same way, and requires them to produce the same evidence of their acts.</div><div class="sentence"> Too many laws may be the sign of a corrupt and overcivilized state of society, too few are the sign of an uncivilized one; as soon as commerce begins to grow, men make themselves customs which have the validity of laws.</div><div class="sentence"> Even equity, which is the exception to the law, conforms to fixed rules and lies for the most part within the limits of previous decisions.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span> <div class="sentence">  IV.</div><div class="sentence"> The bitterness of the Statesman is characteristic of Plato's later style, in which the thoughts of youth and love have fled away, and we are no longer tended by the Muses or the Graces.</div><div class="sentence"> We do not venture to say that Plato was soured by old age, but certainly the kindliness and courtesy of the earlier dialogues have disappeared.</div><div class="sentence"> He sees the world under a harder and grimmer aspect: he is dealing with the reality of things, not with visions or pictures of them: he is seeking by the aid of dialectic only, to arrive at truth.</div><div class="sentence"> He is deeply impressed with the importance of classification: in this alone he finds the true measure of human things; and very often in the process of division curious results are obtained.</div><div class="sentence"> For the dialectical art is no respecter of persons: king and vermin-taker are all alike to the philosopher.</div><div class="sentence"> There may have been a time when the king was a god, but he now is pretty much on a level with his subjects in breeding and education.</div><div class="sentence"> Man should be well advised that he is only one of the animals, and the Hellene in particular should be aware that he himself was the author of the distinction between Hellene and Barbarian, and that the Phrygian would equally divide mankind into Phrygians and Barbarians, and that some intelligent animal, like a crane, might go a step further, and divide the animal world into cranes and all other animals.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato cannot help laughing (compare Theaet.)</div><div class="sentence"> when he thinks of the king running after his subjects, like the pig-driver or the bird-taker.</div><div class="sentence"> He would seriously have him consider how many competitors there are to his throne, chiefly among the class of serving-men.</div><div class="sentence"> A good deal of meaning is lurking in the expression—'There is no art of feeding mankind worthy the name.'</div><div class="sentence"> There is a similar depth in the remark,—'The wonder about states is not that they are short-lived, but that they last so long in spite of the badness of their rulers.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span> <div class="sentence">  V. There is also a paradoxical element in the Statesman which delights in reversing the accustomed use of words.</div><div class="sentence"> The law which to the Greek was the highest object of reverence is an ignorant and brutal tyrant—the tyrant is converted into a beneficent king.</div><div class="sentence"> The sophist too is no longer, as in the earlier dialogues, the rival of the statesman, but assumes his form.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato sees that the ideal of the state in his own day is more and more severed from the actual.</div><div class="sentence"> From such ideals as he had once formed, he turns away to contemplate the decline of the Greek cities which were far worse now in his old age than they had been in his youth, and were to become worse and worse in the ages which followed.</div><div class="sentence"> He cannot contain his disgust at the contemporary statesmen, sophists who had turned politicians, in various forms of men and animals, appearing, some like lions and centaurs, others like satyrs and monkeys.</div><div class="sentence"> In this new disguise the Sophists make their last appearance on the scene: in the Laws Plato appears to have forgotten them, or at any rate makes only a slight allusion to them in a single passage (Laws).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span> <div class="sentence">  VI.</div><div class="sentence"> The Statesman is naturally connected with the Sophist.</div><div class="sentence"> At first sight we are surprised to find that the Eleatic Stranger discourses to us, not only concerning the nature of Being and Not-being, but concerning the king and statesman.</div><div class="sentence"> We perceive, however, that there is no inappropriateness in his maintaining the character of chief speaker, when we remember the close connexion which is assumed by Plato to exist between politics and dialectic.</div><div class="sentence"> In both dialogues the Proteus Sophist is exhibited, first, in the disguise of an Eristic, secondly, of a false statesman.</div><div class="sentence"> There are several lesser features which the two dialogues have in common.</div><div class="sentence"> The styles and the situations of the speakers are very similar; there is the same love of division, and in both of them the mind of the writer is greatly occupied about method, to which he had probably intended to return in the projected 'Philosopher.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span> <div class="sentence">  The Statesman stands midway between the Republic and the Laws, and is also related to the Timaeus.</div><div class="sentence"> The mythical or cosmical element reminds us of the Timaeus, the ideal of the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> A previous chaos in which the elements as yet were not, is hinted at both in the Timaeus and Statesman.</div><div class="sentence"> The same ingenious arts of giving verisimilitude to a fiction are practised in both dialogues, and in both, as well as in the myth at the end of the Republic, Plato touches on the subject of necessity and free-will.</div><div class="sentence"> The words in which he describes the miseries of states seem to be an amplification of the 'Cities will never cease from ill' of the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> The point of view in both is the same; and the differences not really important, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> in the myth, or in the account of the different kinds of states.</div><div class="sentence"> But the treatment of the subject in the Statesman is fragmentary, and the shorter and later work, as might be expected, is less finished, and less worked out in detail.</div><div class="sentence"> The idea of measure and the arrangement of the sciences supply connecting links both with the Republic and the Philebus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span> <div class="sentence">  More than any of the preceding dialogues, the Statesman seems to approximate in thought and language to the Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> There is the same decline and tendency to monotony in style, the same self-consciousness, awkwardness, and over-civility; and in the Laws is contained the pattern of that second best form of government, which, after all, is admitted to be the only attainable one in this world.</div><div class="sentence"> The 'gentle violence,' the marriage of dissimilar natures, the figure of the warp and the woof, are also found in the Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> Both expressly recognize the conception of a first or ideal state, which has receded into an invisible heaven.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor does the account of the origin and growth of society really differ in them, if we make allowance for the mythic character of the narrative in the Statesman.</div><div class="sentence"> The virtuous tyrant is common to both of them; and the Eleatic Stranger takes up a position similar to that of the Athenian Stranger in the Laws.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span> <div class="sentence">  VII.</div><div class="sentence"> There would have been little disposition to doubt the genuineness of the Sophist and Statesman, if they had been compared with the Laws rather than with the Republic, and the Laws had been received, as they ought to be, on the authority of Aristotle and on the ground of their intrinsic excellence, as an undoubted work of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> The detailed consideration of the genuineness and order of the Platonic dialogues has been reserved for another place: a few of the reasons for defending the Sophist and Statesman may be given here.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span> <div class="sentence">  1.</div><div class="sentence"> The excellence, importance, and metaphysical originality of the two dialogues: no works at once so good and of such length are known to have proceeded from the hands of a forger.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span> <div class="sentence">  2.</div><div class="sentence"> The resemblances in them to other dialogues of Plato are such as might be expected to be found in works of the same author, and not in those of an imitator, being too subtle and minute to have been invented by another.</div><div class="sentence"> The similar passages and turns of thought are generally inferior to the parallel passages in his earlier writings; and we might a priori have expected that, if altered, they would have been improved.</div><div class="sentence"> But the comparison of the Laws proves that this repetition of his own thoughts and words in an inferior form is characteristic of Plato's later style.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span> <div class="sentence">  3.</div><div class="sentence"> The close connexion of them with the Theaetetus, Parmenides, and Philebus, involves the fate of these dialogues, as well as of the two suspected ones.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span> <div class="sentence">  4.</div><div class="sentence"> The suspicion of them seems mainly to rest on a presumption that in Plato's writings we may expect to find an uniform type of doctrine and opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> But however we arrange the order, or narrow the circle of the dialogues, we must admit that they exhibit a growth and progress in the mind of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> And the appearance of change or progress is not to be regarded as impugning the genuineness of any particular writings, but may be even an argument in their favour.</div><div class="sentence"> If we suppose the Sophist and Politicus to stand halfway between the Republic and the Laws, and in near connexion with the Theaetetus, the Parmenides, the Philebus, the arguments against them derived from differences of thought and style disappear or may be said without paradox in some degree to confirm their genuineness.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no such interval between the Republic or Phaedrus and the two suspected dialogues, as that which separates all the earlier writings of Plato from the Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> And the Theaetetus, Parmenides, and Philebus, supply links, by which, however different from them, they may be reunited with the great body of the Platonic writings.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly he has.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then we may put all together as one and the same—statesmanship and the statesman—the kingly science and the king.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Tell me of what sort.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Such as this:  You may remember that we made an art of calculation?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Which was, unmistakeably, one of the arts of knowledge?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And to this art of calculation which discerns the differences of numbers shall we assign any other function except to pass judgment on their differences?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How could we?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  You know that the master-builder does not work himself, but is the ruler of workmen?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  He contributes knowledge, not manual labour?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And may therefore be justly said to share in theoretical science?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  But he ought not, like the calculator, to regard his functions as at an end when he has formed a judgment;—he must assign to the individual workmen their appropriate task until they have completed the work.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">074</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Are not all such sciences, no less than arithmetic and the like, subjects of pure knowledge; and is not the difference between the two classes, that the one sort has the power of judging only, and the other of ruling as well?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That is evident.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">076</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  May we not very properly say, that of all knowledge, there are two divisions—one which rules, and the other which judges?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I should think so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">078</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And when men have anything to do in common, that they should be of one mind is surely a desirable thing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">079</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then while we are at unity among ourselves, we need not mind about the fancies of others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">081</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">082</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And now, in which of these divisions shall we place the king?—Is he a judge and a kind of spectator?</div><div class="sentence"> Or shall we assign to him the art of command—for he is a ruler?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">083</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The latter, clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">084</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then we must see whether there is any mark of division in the art of command too.</div><div class="sentence"> I am inclined to think that there is a distinction similar to that of manufacturer and retail dealer, which parts off the king from the herald.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">085</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How is this?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">086</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Why, does not the retailer receive and sell over again the productions of others, which have been sold before?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly he does.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">088</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And is not the herald under command, and does he not receive orders, and in his turn give them to others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">089</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then shall we mingle the kingly art in the same class with the art of the herald, the interpreter, the boatswain, the prophet, and the numerous kindred arts which exercise command; or, as in the preceding comparison we spoke of manufacturers, or sellers for themselves, and of retailers,—seeing, too, that the class of supreme rulers, or rulers for themselves, is almost nameless—shall we make a word following the same analogy, and refer kings to a supreme or ruling-for-self science, leaving the rest to receive a name from some one else?</div><div class="sentence"> For we are seeking the ruler; and our enquiry is not concerned with him who is not a ruler.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Thus a very fair distinction has been attained between the man who gives his own commands, and him who gives another's.</div><div class="sentence"> And now let us see if the supreme power allows of any further division.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">093</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  I think that it does; and please to assist me in making the division.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  At what point?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  May not all rulers be supposed to command for the sake of producing something?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">098</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Nor is there any difficulty in dividing the things produced into two classes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How would you divide them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">100</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Of the whole class, some have life and some are without life.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And by the help of this distinction we may make, if we please, a subdivision of the section of knowledge which commands.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">103</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  At what point?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  One part may be set over the production of lifeless, the other of living objects; and in this way the whole will be divided.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  That division, then, is complete; and now we may leave one half, and take up the other; which may also be divided into two.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Which of the two halves do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Of course that which exercises command about animals.</div><div class="sentence"> For, surely, the royal science is not like that of a master-workman, a science presiding over lifeless objects;—the king has a nobler function, which is the management and control of living beings.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">109</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And the breeding and tending of living beings may be observed to be sometimes a tending of the individual; in other cases, a common care of creatures in flocks?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">111</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">112</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  But the statesman is not a tender of individuals—not like the driver or groom of a single ox or horse; he is rather to be compared with the keeper of a drove of horses or oxen.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">113</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I see, thanks to you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">114</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Shall we call this art of tending many animals together, the art of managing a herd, or the art of collective management?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">115</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  No matter;—whichever suggests itself to us in the course of conversation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">116</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Very good, Socrates; and, if you continue to be not too particular about names, you will be all the richer in wisdom when you are an old man.</div><div class="sentence"> And now, as you say, leaving the discussion of the name,—can you see a way in which a person, by showing the art of herding to be of two kinds, may cause that which is now sought amongst twice the number of things, to be then sought amongst half that number?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">117</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I will try;—there appears to me to be one management of men and another of beasts.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">118</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  You have certainly divided them in a most straightforward and manly style; but you have fallen into an error which hereafter I think that we had better avoid.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">119</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What is the error?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">120</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  I think that we had better not cut off a single small portion which is not a species, from many larger portions; the part should be a species.</div><div class="sentence"> To separate off at once the subject of investigation, is a most excellent plan, if only the separation be rightly made; and you were under the impression that you were right, because you saw that you would come to man; and this led you to hasten the steps.</div><div class="sentence"> But you should not chip off too small a piece, my friend; the safer way is to cut through the middle; which is also the more likely way of finding classes.</div><div class="sentence"> Attention to this principle makes all the difference in a process of enquiry.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">121</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean, Stranger?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">122</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  I will endeavour to speak more plainly out of love to your good parts, Socrates; and, although I cannot at present entirely explain myself, I will try, as we proceed, to make my meaning a little clearer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">123</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What was the error of which, as you say, we were guilty in our recent division?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">124</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The error was just as if some one who wanted to divide the human race, were to divide them after the fashion which prevails in this part of the world; here they cut off the Hellenes as one species, and all the other species of mankind, which are innumerable, and have no ties or common language, they include under the single name of 'barbarians,' and because they have one name they are supposed to be of one species also.</div><div class="sentence"> Or suppose that in dividing numbers you were to cut off ten thousand from all the rest, and make of it one species, comprehending the rest under another separate name, you might say that here too was a single class, because you had given it a single name.</div><div class="sentence"> Whereas you would make a much better and more equal and logical classification of numbers, if you divided them into odd and even; or of the human species, if you divided them into male and female; and only separated off Lydians or Phrygians, or any other tribe, and arrayed them against the rest of the world, when you could no longer make a division into parts which were also classes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">125</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true; but I wish that this distinction between a part and a class could still be made somewhat plainer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">126</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  O Socrates, best of men, you are imposing upon me a very difficult task.</div><div class="sentence"> We have already digressed further from our original intention than we ought, and you would have us wander still further away.</div><div class="sentence"> But we must now return to our subject; and hereafter, when there is a leisure hour, we will follow up the other track; at the same time, I wish you to guard against imagining that you ever heard me declare—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">127</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">128</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  That a class and a part are distinct.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">129</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What did I hear, then?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">130</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  That a class is necessarily a part, but there is no similar necessity that a part should be a class; that is the view which I should always wish you to attribute to me, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">131</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  So be it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">132</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  There is another thing which I should like to know.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">133</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">134</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The point at which we digressed; for, if I am not mistaken, the exact place was at the question, Where you would divide the management of herds.</div><div class="sentence"> To this you appeared rather too ready to answer that there were two species of animals; man being one, and all brutes making up the other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">135</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">136</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  I thought that in taking away a part, you imagined that the remainder formed a class, because you were able to call them by the common name of brutes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">137</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That again is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">138</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Suppose now, O most courageous of dialecticians, that some wise and understanding creature, such as a crane is reputed to be, were, in imitation of you, to make a similar division, and set up cranes against all other animals to their own special glorification, at the same time jumbling together all the others, including man, under the appellation of brutes,—here would be the sort of error which we must try to avoid.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">139</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How can we be safe?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">140</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  If we do not divide the whole class of animals, we shall be less likely to fall into that error.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">141</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We had better not take the whole?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">142</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, there lay the source of error in our former division.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">143</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">144</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  You remember how that part of the art of knowledge which was concerned with command, had to do with the rearing of living creatures,—I mean, with animals in herds?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">145</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">146</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  In that case, there was already implied a division of all animals into tame and wild; those whose nature can be tamed are called tame, and those which cannot be tamed are called wild.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">147</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">148</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And the political science of which we are in search, is and ever was concerned with tame animals, and is also confined to gregarious animals.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">149</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">150</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  But then we ought not to divide, as we did, taking the whole class at once.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither let us be in too great haste to arrive quickly at the political science; for this mistake has already brought upon us the misfortune of which the proverb speaks.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">151</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What misfortune?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">152</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The misfortune of too much haste, which is too little speed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">153</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And all the better, Stranger;—we got what we deserved.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">154</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Very well:  Let us then begin again, and endeavour to divide the collective rearing of animals; for probably the completion of the argument will best show what you are so anxious to know.</div><div class="sentence"> Tell me, then—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">155</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">156</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Have you ever heard, as you very likely may—for I do not suppose that you ever actually visited them—of the preserves of fishes in the Nile, and in the ponds of the Great King; or you may have seen similar preserves in wells at home?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">157</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, to be sure, I have seen them, and I have often heard the others described.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">158</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And you may have heard also, and may have been assured by report, although you have not travelled in those regions, of nurseries of geese and cranes in the plains of Thessaly?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">159</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">160</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  I asked you, because here is a new division of the management of herds, into the management of land and of water herds.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">161</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">162</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And do you agree that we ought to divide the collective rearing of herds into two corresponding parts, the one the rearing of water, and the other the rearing of land herds?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">163</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">164</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  There is surely no need to ask which of these two contains the royal art, for it is evident to everybody.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">165</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">166</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Any one can divide the herds which feed on dry land?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">167</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How would you divide them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">168</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  I should distinguish between those which fly and those which walk.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">169</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">170</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And where shall we look for the political animal?</div><div class="sentence"> Might not an idiot, so to speak, know that he is a pedestrian?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">171</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">172</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The art of managing the walking animal has to be further divided, just as you might halve an even number.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">173</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">174</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Let me note that here appear in view two ways to that part or class which the argument aims at reaching,—the one a speedier way, which cuts off a small portion and leaves a large; the other agrees better with the principle which we were laying down, that as far as we can we should divide in the middle; but it is longer.</div><div class="sentence"> We can take either of them, whichever we please.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">247</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Are they not right in saying so?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">257</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What road?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">258</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  I think that we may have a little amusement; there is a famous tale, of which a good portion may with advantage be interwoven, and then we may resume our series of divisions, and proceed in the old path until we arrive at the desired summit.</div><div class="sentence"> Shall we do as I say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">259</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">260</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Listen, then, to a tale which a child would love to hear; and you are not too old for childish amusement.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">262</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  There did really happen, and will again happen, like many other events of which ancient tradition has preserved the record, the portent which is traditionally said to have occurred in the quarrel of Atreus and Thyestes.</div><div class="sentence"> You have heard, no doubt, and remember what they say happened at that time?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">263</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose you to mean the token of the birth of the golden lamb.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">265</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; there is that legend also.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">266</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Again, we have been often told of the reign of Cronos.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">268</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Did you ever hear that the men of former times were earth-born, and not begotten of one another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">269</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, that is another old tradition.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">270</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  All these stories, and ten thousand others which are still more wonderful, have a common origin; many of them have been lost in the lapse of ages, or are repeated only in a disconnected form; but the origin of them is what no one has told, and may as well be told now; for the tale is suited to throw light on the nature of the king.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">271</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good; and I hope that you will give the whole story, and leave out nothing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">272</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Listen, then.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a time when God himself guides and helps to roll the world in its course; and there is a time, on the completion of a certain cycle, when he lets go, and the world being a living creature, and having originally received intelligence from its author and creator, turns about and by an inherent necessity revolves in the opposite direction.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">273</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">274</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Why, because only the most divine things of all remain ever unchanged and the same, and body is not included in this class.</div><div class="sentence"> Heaven and the universe, as we have termed them, although they have been endowed by the Creator with many glories, partake of a bodily nature, and therefore cannot be entirely free from perturbation.</div><div class="sentence"> But their motion is, as far as possible, single and in the same place, and of the same kind; and is therefore only subject to a reversal, which is the least alteration possible.</div><div class="sentence"> For the lord of all moving things is alone able to move of himself; and to think that he moves them at one time in one direction and at another time in another is blasphemy.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence we must not say that the world is either self-moved always, or all made to go round by God in two opposite courses; or that two Gods, having opposite purposes, make it move round.</div><div class="sentence"> But as I have already said (and this is the only remaining alternative) the world is guided at one time by an external power which is divine and receives fresh life and immortality from the renewing hand of the Creator, and again, when let go, moves spontaneously, being set free at such a time as to have, during infinite cycles of years, a reverse movement:  this is due to its perfect balance, to its vast size, and to the fact that it turns on the smallest pivot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">275</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Your account of the world seems to be very reasonable indeed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">276</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Let us now reflect and try to gather from what has been said the nature of the phenomenon which we affirmed to be the cause of all these wonders.</div><div class="sentence"> It is this.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">277</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">278</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The reversal which takes place from time to time of the motion of the universe.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">279</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How is that the cause?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">280</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Of all changes of the heavenly motions, we may consider this to be the greatest and most complete.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">281</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I should imagine so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">282</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And it may be supposed to result in the greatest changes to the human beings who are the inhabitants of the world at the time.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">283</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Such changes would naturally occur.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">284</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And animals, as we know, survive with difficulty great and serious changes of many different kinds when they come upon them at once.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">285</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">286</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Hence there necessarily occurs a great destruction of them, which extends also to the life of man; few survivors of the race are left, and those who remain become the subjects of several novel and remarkable phenomena, and of one in particular, which takes place at the time when the transition is made to the cycle opposite to that in which we are now living.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">287</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">288</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The life of all animals first came to a standstill, and the mortal nature ceased to be or look older, and was then reversed and grew young and delicate; the white locks of the aged darkened again, and the cheeks the bearded man became smooth, and recovered their former bloom; the bodies of youths in their prime grew softer and smaller, continually by day and night returning and becoming assimilated to the nature of a newly-born child in mind as well as body; in the succeeding stage they wasted away and wholly disappeared.</div><div class="sentence"> And the bodies of those who died by violence at that time quickly passed through the like changes, and in a few days were no more seen.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">289</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then how, Stranger, were the animals created in those days; and in what way were they begotten of one another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">290</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  It is evident, Socrates, that there was no such thing in the then order of nature as the procreation of animals from one another; the earth-born race, of which we hear in story, was the one which existed in those days—they rose again from the ground; and of this tradition, which is now-a-days often unduly discredited, our ancestors, who were nearest in point of time to the end of the last period and came into being at the beginning of this, are to us the heralds.</div><div class="sentence"> And mark how consistent the sequel of the tale is; after the return of age to youth, follows the return of the dead, who are lying in the earth, to life; simultaneously with the reversal of the world the wheel of their generation has been turned back, and they are put together and rise and live in the opposite order, unless God has carried any of them away to some other lot.</div><div class="sentence"> According to this tradition they of necessity sprang from the earth and have the name of earth-born, and so the above legend clings to them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">291</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly that is quite consistent with what has preceded; but tell me, was the life which you said existed in the reign of Cronos in that cycle of the world, or in this?</div><div class="sentence"> For the change in the course of the stars and the sun must have occurred in both.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">292</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  I see that you enter into my meaning;—no, that blessed and spontaneous life does not belong to the present cycle of the world, but to the previous one, in which God superintended the whole revolution of the universe; and the several parts the universe were distributed under the rule of certain inferior deities, as is the way in some places still.</div><div class="sentence"> There were demigods, who were the shepherds of the various species and herds of animals, and each one was in all respects sufficient for those of whom he was the shepherd; neither was there any violence, or devouring of one another, or war or quarrel among them; and I might tell of ten thousand other blessings, which belonged to that dispensation.</div><div class="sentence"> The reason why the life of man was, as tradition says, spontaneous, is as follows:  In those days God himself was their shepherd, and ruled over them, just as man, who is by comparison a divine being, still rules over the lower animals.</div><div class="sentence"> Under him there were no forms of government or separate possession of women and children; for all men rose again from the earth, having no memory of the past.</div><div class="sentence"> And although they had nothing of this sort, the earth gave them fruits in abundance, which grew on trees and shrubs unbidden, and were not planted by the hand of man.</div><div class="sentence"> And they dwelt naked, and mostly in the open air, for the temperature of their seasons was mild; and they had no beds, but lay on soft couches of grass, which grew plentifully out of the earth.</div><div class="sentence"> Such was the life of man in the days of Cronos, Socrates; the character of our present life, which is said to be under Zeus, you know from your own experience.</div><div class="sentence"> Can you, and will you, determine which of them you deem the happier?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">293</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">294</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then shall I determine for you as well as I can?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">295</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">296</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Suppose that the nurslings of Cronos, having this boundless leisure, and the power of holding intercourse, not only with men, but with the brute creation, had used all these advantages with a view to philosophy, conversing with the brutes as well as with one another, and learning of every nature which was gifted with any special power, and was able to contribute some special experience to the store of wisdom, there would be no difficulty in deciding that they would be a thousand times happier than the men of our own day.</div><div class="sentence"> Or, again, if they had merely eaten and drunk until they were full, and told stories to one another and to the animals—such stories as are now attributed to them—in this case also, as I should imagine, the answer would be easy.</div><div class="sentence"> But until some satisfactory witness can be found of the love of that age for knowledge and discussion, we had better let the matter drop, and give the reason why we have unearthed this tale, and then we shall be able to get on.</div><div class="sentence"> In the fulness of time, when the change was to take place, and the earth-born race had all perished, and every soul had completed its proper cycle of births and been sown in the earth her appointed number of times, the pilot of the universe let the helm go, and retired to his place of view; and then Fate and innate desire reversed the motion of the world.</div><div class="sentence"> Then also all the inferior deities who share the rule of the supreme power, being informed of what was happening, let go the parts of the world which were under their control.</div><div class="sentence"> And the world turning round with a sudden shock, being impelled in an opposite direction from beginning to end, was shaken by a mighty earthquake, which wrought a new destruction of all manner of animals.</div><div class="sentence"> Afterwards, when sufficient time had elapsed, the tumult and confusion and earthquake ceased, and the universal creature, once more at peace, attained to a calm, and settled down into his own orderly and accustomed course, having the charge and rule of himself and of all the creatures which are contained in him, and executing, as far as he remembered them, the instructions of his Father and Creator, more precisely at first, but afterwords with less exactness.</div><div class="sentence"> The reason of the falling off was the admixture of matter in him; this was inherent in the primal nature, which was full of disorder, until attaining to the present order.</div><div class="sentence"> From God, the constructor, the world received all that is good in him, but from a previous state came elements of evil and unrighteousness, which, thence derived, first of all passed into the world, and were then transmitted to the animals.</div><div class="sentence"> While the world was aided by the pilot in nurturing the animals, the evil was small, and great the good which he produced, but after the separation, when the world was let go, at first all proceeded well enough; but, as time went on, there was more and more forgetting, and the old discord again held sway and burst forth in full glory; and at last small was the good, and great was the admixture of evil, and there was a danger of universal ruin to the world, and to the things contained in him.</div><div class="sentence"> Wherefore God, the orderer of all, in his tender care, seeing that the world was in great straits, and fearing that all might be dissolved in the storm and disappear in infinite chaos, again seated himself at the helm; and bringing back the elements which had fallen into dissolution and disorder to the motion which had prevailed under his dispensation, he set them in order and restored them, and made the world imperishable and immortal.</div><div class="sentence"> And this is the whole tale, of which the first part will suffice to illustrate the nature of the king.</div><div class="sentence"> For when the world turned towards the present cycle of generation, the age of man again stood still, and a change opposite to the previous one was the result.</div><div class="sentence"> The small creatures which had almost disappeared grew in and stature, and the newly-born children of the earth became grey and died and sank into the earth again.</div><div class="sentence"> All things changed, imitating and following the condition of the universe, and of necessity agreeing with that in their mode of conception and generation and nurture; for no animal was any longer allowed to come into being in the earth through the agency of other creative beings, but as the world was ordained to be the lord of his own progress, in like manner the parts were ordained to grow and generate and give nourishment, as far as they could, of themselves, impelled by a similar movement.</div><div class="sentence"> And so we have arrived at the real end of this discourse; for although there might be much to tell of the lower animals, and of the condition out of which they changed and of the causes of the change, about men there is not much, and that little is more to the purpose.</div><div class="sentence"> Deprived of the care of God, who had possessed and tended them, they were left helpless and defenceless, and were torn in pieces by the beasts, who were naturally fierce and had now grown wild.</div><div class="sentence"> And in the first ages they were still without skill or resource; the food which once grew spontaneously had failed, and as yet they knew not how to procure it, because they had never felt the pressure of necessity.</div><div class="sentence"> For all these reasons they were in a great strait; wherefore also the gifts spoken of in the old tradition were imparted to man by the gods, together with so much teaching and education as was indispensable; fire was given to them by Prometheus, the arts by Hephaestus and his fellow-worker, Athene, seeds and plants by others.</div><div class="sentence"> From these is derived all that has helped to frame human life; since the care of the Gods, as I was saying, had now failed men, and they had to order their course of life for themselves, and were their own masters, just like the universal creature whom they imitate and follow, ever changing, as he changes, and ever living and growing, at one time in one manner, and at another time in another.</div><div class="sentence"> Enough of the story, which may be of use in showing us how greatly we erred in the delineation of the king and the statesman in our previous discourse.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">297</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What was this great error of which you speak?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">298</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  There were two; the first a lesser one, the other was an error on a much larger and grander scale.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">299</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">300</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  I mean to say that when we were asked about a king and statesman of the present cycle and generation, we told of a shepherd of a human flock who belonged to the other cycle, and of one who was a god when he ought to have been a man; and this a great error.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, we declared him to be the ruler of the entire State, without explaining how:  this was not the whole truth, nor very intelligible; but still it was true, and therefore the second error was not so great as the first.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">301</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">302</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Before we can expect to have a perfect description of the statesman we must define the nature of his office.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">303</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">304</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And the myth was introduced in order to show, not only that all others are rivals of the true shepherd who is the object of our search, but in order that we might have a clearer view of him who is alone worthy to receive this appellation, because he alone of shepherds and herdsmen, according to the image which we have employed, has the care of human beings.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">305</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">306</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And I cannot help thinking, Socrates, that the form of the divine shepherd is even higher than that of a king; whereas the statesmen who are now on earth seem to be much more like their subjects in character, and much more nearly to partake of their breeding and education.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">307</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">308</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Still they must be investigated all the same, to see whether, like the divine shepherd, they are above their subjects or on a level with them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">309</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">310</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  To resume: —Do you remember that we spoke of a command-for-self exercised over animals, not singly but collectively, which we called the art of rearing a herd?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">311</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I remember.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">312</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  There, somewhere, lay our error; for we never included or mentioned the Statesman; and we did not observe that he had no place in our nomenclature.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">313</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How was that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">314</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  All other herdsmen 'rear' their herds, but this is not a suitable term to apply to the Statesman; we should use a name which is common to them all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">315</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True, if there be such a name.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">316</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Why, is not 'care' of herds applicable to all?</div><div class="sentence"> For this implies no feeding, or any special duty; if we say either 'tending' the herds, or 'managing' the herds, or 'having the care' of them, the same word will include all, and then we may wrap up the Statesman with the rest, as the argument seems to require.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">317</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Quite right; but how shall we take the next step in the division?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">318</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  As before we divided the art of 'rearing' herds accordingly as they were land or water herds, winged and wingless, mixing or not mixing the breed, horned and hornless, so we may divide by these same differences the 'tending' of herds, comprehending in our definition the kingship of to-day and the rule of Cronos.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">319</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That is clear; but I still ask, what is to follow.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">320</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  If the word had been 'managing' herds, instead of feeding or rearing them, no one would have argued that there was no care of men in the case of the politician, although it was justly contended, that there was no human art of feeding them which was worthy of the name, or at least, if there were, many a man had a prior and greater right to share in such an art than any king.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">321</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">322</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  But no other art or science will have a prior or better right than the royal science to care for human society and to rule over men in general.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">323</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">324</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  In the next place, Socrates, we must surely notice that a great error was committed at the end of our analysis.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">325</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What was it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">326</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Why, supposing we were ever so sure that there is such an art as the art of rearing or feeding bipeds, there was no reason why we should call this the royal or political art, as though there were no more to be said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">327</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">328</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Our first duty, as we were saying, was to remodel the name, so as to have the notion of care rather than of feeding, and then to divide, for there may be still considerable divisions.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">329</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How can they be made?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">330</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  First, by separating the divine shepherd from the human guardian or manager.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">331</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">332</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And the art of management which is assigned to man would again have to be subdivided.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">333</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  On what principle?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">334</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  On the principle of voluntary and compulsory.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">335</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">336</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Because, if I am not mistaken, there has been an error here; for our simplicity led us to rank king and tyrant together, whereas they are utterly distinct, like their modes of government.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">337</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">338</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then, now, as I said, let us make the correction and divide human care into two parts, on the principle of voluntary and compulsory.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">339</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">340</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And if we call the management of violent rulers tyranny, and the voluntary management of herds of voluntary bipeds politics, may we not further assert that he who has this latter art of management is the true king and statesman?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">341</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I think, Stranger, that we have now completed the account of the Statesman.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">342</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Would that we had, Socrates, but I have to satisfy myself as well as you; and in my judgment the figure of the king is not yet perfected; like statuaries who, in their too great haste, having overdone the several parts of their work, lose time in cutting them down, so too we, partly out of haste, partly out of a magnanimous desire to expose our former error, and also because we imagined that a king required grand illustrations, have taken up a marvellous lump of fable, and have been obliged to use more than was necessary.</div><div class="sentence"> This made us discourse at large, and, nevertheless, the story never came to an end.</div><div class="sentence"> And our discussion might be compared to a picture of some living being which had been fairly drawn in outline, but had not yet attained the life and clearness which is given by the blending of colours.</div><div class="sentence"> Now to intelligent persons a living being had better be delineated by language and discourse than by any painting or work of art:  to the duller sort by works of art.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">343</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true; but what is the imperfection which still remains?</div><div class="sentence"> I wish that you would tell me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">344</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The higher ideas, my dear friend, can hardly be set forth except through the medium of examples; every man seems to know all things in a dreamy sort of way, and then again to wake up and to know nothing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">345</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">346</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  I fear that I have been unfortunate in raising a question about our experience of knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">347</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">348</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Why, because my 'example' requires the assistance of another example.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">349</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Proceed; you need not fear that I shall tire.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">350</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  I will proceed, finding, as I do, such a ready listener in you:  when children are beginning to know their letters—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">351</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What are you going to say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">352</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  That they distinguish the several letters well enough in very short and easy syllables, and are able to tell them correctly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">353</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">354</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Whereas in other syllables they do not recognize them, and think and speak falsely of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">355</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">356</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Will not the best and easiest way of bringing them to a knowledge of what they do not as yet know be—</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">358</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  To refer them first of all to cases in which they judge correctly about the letters in question, and then to compare these with the cases in which they do not as yet know, and to show them that the letters are the same, and have the same character in both combinations, until all cases in which they are right have been placed side by side with all cases in which they are wrong.</div><div class="sentence"> In this way they have examples, and are made to learn that each letter in every combination is always the same and not another, and is always called by the same name.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">359</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">360</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Are not examples formed in this manner?</div><div class="sentence"> We take a thing and compare it with another distinct instance of the same thing, of which we have a right conception, and out of the comparison there arises one true notion, which includes both of them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">361</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">362</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Can we wonder, then, that the soul has the same uncertainty about the alphabet of things, and sometimes and in some cases is firmly fixed by the truth in each particular, and then, again, in other cases is altogether at sea; having somehow or other a correct notion of combinations; but when the elements are transferred into the long and difficult language (syllables) of facts, is again ignorant of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">363</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There is nothing wonderful in that.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">364</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Could any one, my friend, who began with false opinion ever expect to arrive even at a small portion of truth and to attain wisdom?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">365</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Hardly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">366</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then you and I will not be far wrong in trying to see the nature of example in general in a small and particular instance; afterwards from lesser things we intend to pass to the royal class, which is the highest form of the same nature, and endeavour to discover by rules of art what the management of cities is; and then the dream will become a reality to us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">367</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">368</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then, once more, let us resume the previous argument, and as there were innumerable rivals of the royal race who claim to have the care of states, let us part them all off, and leave him alone; and, as I was saying, a model or example of this process has first to be framed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">369</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">370</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  What model is there which is small, and yet has any analogy with the political occupation?</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose, Socrates, that if we have no other example at hand, we choose weaving, or, more precisely, weaving of wool—this will be quite enough, without taking the whole of weaving, to illustrate our meaning?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">371</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">372</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Why should we not apply to weaving the same processes of division and subdivision which we have already applied to other classes; going once more as rapidly as we can through all the steps until we come to that which is needed for our purpose?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">374</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  I shall reply by actually performing the process.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">378</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  In the next place, let us make the reflection, that the art of weaving clothes, which an incompetent person might fancy to have been sufficiently described, has been separated off from several others which are of the same family, but not from the co-operative arts.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">383</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Precisely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">384</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then we separated off the currier's art, which prepared coverings in entire pieces, and the art of sheltering, and subtracted the various arts of making water-tight which are employed in building, and in general in carpentering, and in other crafts, and all such arts as furnish impediments to thieving and acts of violence, and are concerned with making the lids of boxes and the fixing of doors, being divisions of the art of joining; and we also cut off the manufacture of arms, which is a section of the great and manifold art of making defences; and we originally began by parting off the whole of the magic art which is concerned with antidotes, and have left, as would appear, the very art of which we were in search, the art of protection against winter cold, which fabricates woollen defences, and has the name of weaving.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">385</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">386</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, my boy, but that is not all; for the first process to which the material is subjected is the opposite of weaving.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">387</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">388</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Weaving is a sort of uniting?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">389</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">390</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  But the first process is a separation of the clotted and matted fibres?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">391</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">392</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  I mean the work of the carder's art; for we cannot say that carding is weaving, or that the carder is a weaver.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">393</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">394</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Again, if a person were to say that the art of making the warp and the woof was the art of weaving, he would say what was paradoxical and false.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">395</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">396</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Shall we say that the whole art of the fuller or of the mender has nothing to do with the care and treatment of clothes, or are we to regard all these as arts of weaving?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">397</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">398</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And yet surely all these arts will maintain that they are concerned with the treatment and production of clothes; they will dispute the exclusive prerogative of weaving, and though assigning a larger sphere to that, will still reserve a considerable field for themselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">399</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">400</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Besides these, there are the arts which make tools and instruments of weaving, and which will claim at least to be co-operative causes in every work of the weaver.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">401</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Most true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">402</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, suppose that we define weaving, or rather that part of it which has been selected by us, to be the greatest and noblest of arts which are concerned with woollen garments—shall we be right?</div><div class="sentence"> Is not the definition, although true, wanting in clearness and completeness; for do not all those other arts require to be first cleared away?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">403</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">404</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then the next thing will be to separate them, in order that the argument may proceed in a regular manner?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">405</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">406</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Let us consider, in the first place, that there are two kinds of arts entering into everything which we do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">407</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What are they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">408</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The one kind is the conditional or co-operative, the other the principal cause.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">409</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">410</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The arts which do not manufacture the actual thing, but which furnish the necessary tools for the manufacture, without which the several arts could not fulfil their appointed work, are co-operative; but those which make the things themselves are causal.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">411</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  A very reasonable distinction.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">412</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Thus the arts which make spindles, combs, and other instruments of the production of clothes, may be called co-operative, and those which treat and fabricate the things themselves, causal.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">413</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">414</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The arts of washing and mending, and the other preparatory arts which belong to the causal class, and form a division of the great art of adornment, may be all comprehended under what we call the fuller's art.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">415</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">416</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Carding and spinning threads and all the parts of the process which are concerned with the actual manufacture of a woollen garment form a single art, which is one of those universally acknowledged,—the art of working in wool.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">417</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">418</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Of working in wool, again, there are two divisions, and both these are parts of two arts at once.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">419</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">420</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Carding and one half of the use of the comb, and the other processes of wool-working which separate the composite, may be classed together as belonging both to the art of wool-working, and also to one of the two great arts which are of universal application—the art of composition and the art of division.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">421</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">422</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  To the latter belong carding and the other processes of which I was just now speaking; the art of discernment or division in wool and yarn, which is effected in one manner with the comb and in another with the hands, is variously described under all the names which I just now mentioned.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">423</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">424</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Again, let us take some process of wool-working which is also a portion of the art of composition, and, dismissing the elements of division which we found there, make two halves, one on the principle of composition, and the other on the principle of division.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">425</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let that be done.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">426</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And once more, Socrates, we must divide the part which belongs at once both to wool-working and composition, if we are ever to discover satisfactorily the aforesaid art of weaving.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">427</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We must.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">428</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, certainly, and let us call one part of the art the art of twisting threads, the other the art of combining them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">429</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do I understand you, in speaking of twisting, to be referring to manufacture of the warp?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">430</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, and of the woof too; how, if not by twisting, is the woof made?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">431</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There is no other way.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">432</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then suppose that you define the warp and the woof, for I think that the definition will be of use to you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">433</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How shall I define them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">434</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  As thus:  A piece of carded wool which is drawn out lengthwise and breadthwise is said to be pulled out.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">435</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">436</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And the wool thus prepared, when twisted by the spindle, and made into a firm thread, is called the warp, and the art which regulates these operations the art of spinning the warp.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">437</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">438</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And the threads which are more loosely spun, having a softness proportioned to the intertexture of the warp and to the degree of force used in dressing the cloth,—the threads which are thus spun are called the woof, and the art which is set over them may be called the art of spinning the woof.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">439</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">440</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And, now, there can be no mistake about the nature of the part of weaving which we have undertaken to define.</div><div class="sentence"> For when that part of the art of composition which is employed in the working of wool forms a web by the regular intertexture of warp and woof, the entire woven substance is called by us a woollen garment, and the art which presides over this is the art of weaving.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">441</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">442</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  But why did we not say at once that weaving is the art of entwining warp and woof, instead of making a long and useless circuit?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">443</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I thought, Stranger, that there was nothing useless in what was said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">444</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Very likely, but you may not always think so, my sweet friend; and in case any feeling of dissatisfaction should hereafter arise in your mind, as it very well may, let me lay down a principle which will apply to arguments in general.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">445</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Proceed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">446</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Let us begin by considering the whole nature of excess and defect, and then we shall have a rational ground on which we may praise or blame too much length or too much shortness in discussions of this kind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">447</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us do so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">448</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The points on which I think that we ought to dwell are the following: —</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">449</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">450</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Length and shortness, excess and defect; with all of these the art of measurement is conversant.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">451</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">452</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And the art of measurement has to be divided into two parts, with a view to our present purpose.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">453</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Where would you make the division?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">454</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  As thus:  I would make two parts, one having regard to the relativity of greatness and smallness to each other; and there is another, without which the existence of production would be impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">455</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">456</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Do you not think that it is only natural for the greater to be called greater with reference to the less alone, and the less less with reference to the greater alone?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">457</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">458</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but is there not also something exceeding and exceeded by the principle of the mean, both in speech and action, and is not this a reality, and the chief mark of difference between good and bad men?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">459</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Plainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">460</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then we must suppose that the great and small exist and are discerned in both these ways, and not, as we were saying before, only relatively to one another, but there must also be another comparison of them with the mean or ideal standard; would you like to hear the reason why?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">461</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">462</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  If we assume the greater to exist only in relation to the less, there will never be any comparison of either with the mean.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">463</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">464</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And would not this doctrine be the ruin of all the arts and their creations; would not the art of the Statesman and the aforesaid art of weaving disappear?</div><div class="sentence"> For all these arts are on the watch against excess and defect, not as unrealities, but as real evils, which occasion a difficulty in action; and the excellence or beauty of every work of art is due to this observance of measure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">465</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">466</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  But if the science of the Statesman disappears, the search for the royal science will be impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">467</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">468</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, as in the case of the Sophist we extorted the inference that not-being had an existence, because here was the point at which the argument eluded our grasp, so in this we must endeavour to show that the greater and less are not only to be measured with one another, but also have to do with the production of the mean; for if this is not admitted, neither a statesman nor any other man of action can be an undisputed master of his science.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">469</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, we must certainly do again what we did then.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">470</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  But this, Socrates, is a greater work than the other, of which we only too well remember the length.</div><div class="sentence"> I think, however, that we may fairly assume something of this sort—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">471</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">472</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  That we shall some day require this notion of a mean with a view to the demonstration of absolute truth; meanwhile, the argument that the very existence of the arts must be held to depend on the possibility of measuring more or less, not only with one another, but also with a view to the attainment of the mean, seems to afford a grand support and satisfactory proof of the doctrine which we are maintaining; for if there are arts, there is a standard of measure, and if there is a standard of measure, there are arts; but if either is wanting, there is neither.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">473</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True; and what is the next step?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">474</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The next step clearly is to divide the art of measurement into two parts, as we have said already, and to place in the one part all the arts which measure number, length, depth, breadth, swiftness with their opposites; and to have another part in which they are measured with the mean, and the fit, and the opportune, and the due, and with all those words, in short, which denote a mean or standard removed from the extremes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">475</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Here are two vast divisions, embracing two very different spheres.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">476</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  There are many accomplished men, Socrates, who say, believing themselves to speak wisely, that the art of measurement is universal, and has to do with all things.</div><div class="sentence"> And this means what we are now saying; for all things which come within the province of art do certainly in some sense partake of measure.</div><div class="sentence"> But these persons, because they are not accustomed to distinguish classes according to real forms, jumble together two widely different things, relation to one another, and to a standard, under the idea that they are the same, and also fall into the converse error of dividing other things not according to their real parts.</div><div class="sentence"> Whereas the right way is, if a man has first seen the unity of things, to go on with the enquiry and not desist until he has found all the differences contained in it which form distinct classes; nor again should he be able to rest contented with the manifold diversities which are seen in a multitude of things until he has comprehended all of them that have any affinity within the bounds of one similarity and embraced them within the reality of a single kind.</div><div class="sentence"> But we have said enough on this head, and also of excess and defect; we have only to bear in mind that two divisions of the art of measurement have been discovered which are concerned with them, and not forget what they are.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">477</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We will not forget.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">478</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And now that this discussion is completed, let us go on to consider another question, which concerns not this argument only but the conduct of such arguments in general.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">479</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What is this new question?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">480</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Take the case of a child who is engaged in learning his letters:  when he is asked what letters make up a word, should we say that the question is intended to improve his grammatical knowledge of that particular word, or of all words?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">481</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly, in order that he may have a better knowledge of all words.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">482</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And is our enquiry about the Statesman intended only to improve our knowledge of politics, or our power of reasoning generally?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">483</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly, as in the former example, the purpose is general.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">484</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Still less would any rational man seek to analyse the notion of weaving for its own sake.</div><div class="sentence"> But people seem to forget that some things have sensible images, which are readily known, and can be easily pointed out when any one desires to answer an enquirer without any trouble or argument; whereas the greatest and highest truths have no outward image of themselves visible to man, which he who wishes to satisfy the soul of the enquirer can adapt to the eye of sense (compare Phaedr.</div><div class="sentence"> ), and therefore we ought to train ourselves to give and accept a rational account of them; for immaterial things, which are the noblest and greatest, are shown only in thought and idea, and in no other way, and all that we are now saying is said for the sake of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover, there is always less difficulty in fixing the mind on small matters than on great.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">485</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">486</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Let us call to mind the bearing of all this.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">487</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">488</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  I wanted to get rid of any impression of tediousness which we may have experienced in the discussion about weaving, and the reversal of the universe, and in the discussion concerning the Sophist and the being of not-being.</div><div class="sentence"> I know that they were felt to be too long, and I reproached myself with this, fearing that they might be not only tedious but irrelevant; and all that I have now said is only designed to prevent the recurrence of any such disagreeables for the future.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">489</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div><div class="sentence"> Will you proceed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">490</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then I would like to observe that you and I, remembering what has been said, should praise or blame the length or shortness of discussions, not by comparing them with one another, but with what is fitting, having regard to the part of measurement, which, as we said, was to be borne in mind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">491</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">492</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And yet, not everything is to be judged even with a view to what is fitting; for we should only want such a length as is suited to give pleasure, if at all, as a secondary matter; and reason tells us, that we should be contented to make the ease or rapidity of an enquiry, not our first, but our second object; the first and highest of all being to assert the great method of division according to species—whether the discourse be shorter or longer is not to the point.</div><div class="sentence"> No offence should be taken at length, but the longer and shorter are to be employed indifferently, according as either of them is better calculated to sharpen the wits of the auditors.</div><div class="sentence"> Reason would also say to him who censures the length of discourses on such occasions and cannot away with their circumlocution, that he should not be in such a hurry to have done with them, when he can only complain that they are tedious, but he should prove that if they had been shorter they would have made those who took part in them better dialecticians, and more capable of expressing the truth of things; about any other praise and blame, he need not trouble himself—he should pretend not to hear them.</div><div class="sentence"> But we have had enough of this, as you will probably agree with me in thinking.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us return to our Statesman, and apply to his case the aforesaid example of weaving.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">493</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good;—let us do as you say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">494</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The art of the king has been separated from the similar arts of shepherds, and, indeed, from all those which have to do with herds at all.</div><div class="sentence"> There still remain, however, of the causal and co-operative arts those which are immediately concerned with States, and which must first be distinguished from one another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">495</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">496</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  You know that these arts cannot easily be divided into two halves; the reason will be very evident as we proceed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">497</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then we had better do so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">498</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  We must carve them like a victim into members or limbs, since we cannot bisect them.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Phaedr.)</div><div class="sentence"> For we certainly should divide everything into as few parts as possible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">499</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What is to be done in this case?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">500</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  What we did in the example of weaving—all those arts which furnish the tools were regarded by us as co-operative.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">501</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">502</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  So now, and with still more reason, all arts which make any implement in a State, whether great or small, may be regarded by us as co-operative, for without them neither State nor Statesmanship would be possible; and yet we are not inclined to say that any of them is a product of the kingly art.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">503</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  No, indeed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">504</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The task of separating this class from others is not an easy one; for there is plausibility in saying that anything in the world is the instrument of doing something.</div><div class="sentence"> But there is another class of possessions in a city, of which I have a word to say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">505</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What class do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">506</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  A class which may be described as not having this power; that is to say, not like an instrument, framed for production, but designed for the preservation of that which is produced.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">507</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  To what do you refer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">508</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  To the class of vessels, as they are comprehensively termed, which are constructed for the preservation of things moist and dry, of things prepared in the fire or out of the fire; this is a very large class, and has, if I am not mistaken, literally nothing to do with the royal art of which we are in search.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">509</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">510</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  There is also a third class of possessions to be noted, different from these and very extensive, moving or resting on land or water, honourable and also dishonourable.</div><div class="sentence"> The whole of this class has one name, because it is intended to be sat upon, being always a seat for something.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">511</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">512</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  A vehicle, which is certainly not the work of the Statesman, but of the carpenter, potter, and coppersmith.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">513</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I understand.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">514</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And is there not a fourth class which is again different, and in which most of the things formerly mentioned are contained,—every kind of dress, most sorts of arms, walls and enclosures, whether of earth or stone, and ten thousand other things?</div><div class="sentence"> all of which being made for the sake of defence, may be truly called defences, and are for the most part to be regarded as the work of the builder or of the weaver, rather than of the Statesman.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">515</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">516</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Shall we add a fifth class, of ornamentation and drawing, and of the imitations produced by drawing and music, which are designed for amusement only, and may be fairly comprehended under one name?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">517</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">518</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Plaything is the name.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">519</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">520</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  That one name may be fitly predicated of all of them, for none of these things have a serious purpose—amusement is their sole aim.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">521</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That again I understand.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">522</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then there is a class which provides materials for all these, out of which and in which the arts already mentioned fabricate their works;—this manifold class, I say, which is the creation and offspring of many other arts, may I not rank sixth?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">523</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">524</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  I am referring to gold, silver, and other metals, and all that wood-cutting and shearing of every sort provides for the art of carpentry and plaiting; and there is the process of barking and stripping the cuticle of plants, and the currier's art, which strips off the skins of animals, and other similar arts which manufacture corks and papyri and cords, and provide for the manufacture of composite species out of simple kinds—the whole class may be termed the primitive and simple possession of man, and with this the kingly science has no concern at all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">525</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">526</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The provision of food and of all other things which mingle their particles with the particles of the human body, and minister to the body, will form a seventh class, which may be called by the general term of nourishment, unless you have any better name to offer.</div><div class="sentence"> This, however, appertains rather to the husbandman, huntsman, trainer, doctor, cook, and is not to be assigned to the Statesman's art.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">527</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">528</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  These seven classes include nearly every description of property, with the exception of tame animals.</div><div class="sentence"> Consider;—there was the original material, which ought to have been placed first; next come instruments, vessels, vehicles, defences, playthings, nourishment; small things, which may be included under one of these—as for example, coins, seals and stamps, are omitted, for they have not in them the character of any larger kind which includes them; but some of them may, with a little forcing, be placed among ornaments, and others may be made to harmonize with the class of implements.</div><div class="sentence"> The art of herding, which has been already divided into parts, will include all property in tame animals, except slaves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">529</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">530</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The class of slaves and ministers only remains, and I suspect that in this the real aspirants for the throne, who are the rivals of the king in the formation of the political web, will be discovered; just as spinners, carders, and the rest of them, were the rivals of the weaver.</div><div class="sentence"> All the others, who were termed co-operators, have been got rid of among the occupations already mentioned, and separated from the royal and political science.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">531</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">532</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Let us go a little nearer, in order that we may be more certain of the complexion of this remaining class.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">533</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us do so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">534</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  We shall find from our present point of view that the greatest servants are in a case and condition which is the reverse of what we anticipated.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">535</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Who are they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">536</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Those who have been purchased, and have so become possessions; these are unmistakably slaves, and certainly do not claim royal science.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">537</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">538</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Again, freemen who of their own accord become the servants of the other classes in a State, and who exchange and equalise the products of husbandry and the other arts, some sitting in the market-place, others going from city to city by land or sea, and giving money in exchange for money or for other productions—the money-changer, the merchant, the ship-owner, the retailer, will not put in any claim to statecraft or politics?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">539</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  No; unless, indeed, to the politics of commerce.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">540</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  But surely men whom we see acting as hirelings and serfs, and too happy to turn their hand to anything, will not profess to share in royal science?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">541</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">542</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  But what would you say of some other serviceable officials?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">543</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Who are they, and what services do they perform?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">544</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  There are heralds, and scribes perfected by practice, and divers others who have great skill in various sorts of business connected with the government of states—what shall we call them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">545</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  They are the officials, and servants of the rulers, as you just now called them, but not themselves rulers.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">546</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  There may be something strange in any servant pretending to be a ruler, and yet I do not think that I could have been dreaming when I imagined that the principal claimants to political science would be found somewhere in this neighbourhood.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">547</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">548</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Well, let us draw nearer, and try the claims of some who have not yet been tested:  in the first place, there are diviners, who have a portion of servile or ministerial science, and are thought to be the interpreters of the gods to men.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">549</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">550</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  There is also the priestly class, who, as the law declares, know how to give the gods gifts from men in the form of sacrifices which are acceptable to them, and to ask on our behalf blessings in return from them.</div><div class="sentence"> Now both these are branches of the servile or ministerial art.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">551</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">552</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And here I think that we seem to be getting on the right track; for the priest and the diviner are swollen with pride and prerogative, and they create an awful impression of themselves by the magnitude of their enterprises; in Egypt, the king himself is not allowed to reign, unless he have priestly powers, and if he should be of another class and has thrust himself in, he must get enrolled in the priesthood.</div><div class="sentence"> In many parts of Hellas, the duty of offering the most solemn propitiatory sacrifices is assigned to the highest magistracies, and here, at Athens, the most solemn and national of the ancient sacrifices are supposed to be celebrated by him who has been chosen by lot to be the King Archon.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">553</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Precisely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">554</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  But who are these other kings and priests elected by lot who now come into view followed by their retainers and a vast throng, as the former class disappears and the scene changes?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">555</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Whom can you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">556</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  They are a strange crew.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">557</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why strange?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">558</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  A minute ago I thought that they were animals of every tribe; for many of them are like lions and centaurs, and many more like satyrs and such weak and shifty creatures;—Protean shapes quickly changing into one another's forms and natures; and now, Socrates, I begin to see who they are.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">559</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Who are they?</div><div class="sentence"> You seem to be gazing on some strange vision.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">560</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; every one looks strange when you do not know him; and just now I myself fell into this mistake—at first sight, coming suddenly upon him, I did not recognize the politician and his troop.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">561</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Who is he?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">562</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The chief of Sophists and most accomplished of wizards, who must at any cost be separated from the true king or Statesman, if we are ever to see daylight in the present enquiry.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">563</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That is a hope not lightly to be renounced.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">564</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Never, if I can help it; and, first, let me ask you a question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">565</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">566</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Is not monarchy a recognized form of government?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">567</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">568</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And, after monarchy, next in order comes the government of the few?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">569</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">570</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Is not the third form of government the rule of the multitude, which is called by the name of democracy?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">571</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">572</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And do not these three expand in a manner into five, producing out of themselves two other names?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">573</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What are they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">574</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What are they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">575</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  There is a criterion of voluntary and involuntary, poverty and riches, law and the absence of law, which men now-a-days apply to them; the two first they subdivide accordingly, and ascribe to monarchy two forms and two corresponding names, royalty and tyranny.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">576</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">577</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And the government of the few they distinguish by the names of aristocracy and oligarchy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">578</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">579</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Democracy alone, whether rigidly observing the laws or not, and whether the multitude rule over the men of property with their consent or against their consent, always in ordinary language has the same name.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">580</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">581</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  But do you suppose that any form of government which is defined by these characteristics of the one, the few, or the many, of poverty or wealth, of voluntary or compulsory submission, of written law or the absence of law, can be a right one?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">582</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">583</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Reflect; and follow me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">584</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In what direction?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">585</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Shall we abide by what we said at first, or shall we retract our words?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">586</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  To what do you refer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">587</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  If I am not mistaken, we said that royal power was a science?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">588</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">589</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And a science of a peculiar kind, which was selected out of the rest as having a character which is at once judicial and authoritative?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">590</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">591</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And there was one kind of authority over lifeless things and another other living animals; and so we proceeded in the division step by step up to this point, not losing the idea of science, but unable as yet to determine the nature of the particular science?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">592</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">593</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Hence we are led to observe that the distinguishing principle of the State cannot be the few or many, the voluntary or involuntary, poverty or riches; but some notion of science must enter into it, if we are to be consistent with what has preceded.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">594</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And we must be consistent.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">595</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, in which of these various forms of States may the science of government, which is among the greatest of all sciences and most difficult to acquire, be supposed to reside?</div><div class="sentence"> That we must discover, and then we shall see who are the false politicians who pretend to be politicians but are not, although they persuade many, and shall separate them from the wise king.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">596</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That, as the argument has already intimated, will be our duty.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">597</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Do you think that the multitude in a State can attain political science?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">598</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">599</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  But, perhaps, in a city of a thousand men, there would be a hundred, or say fifty, who could?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">600</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In that case political science would certainly be the easiest of all sciences; there could not be found in a city of that number as many really first-rate draught-players, if judged by the standard of the rest of Hellas, and there would certainly not be as many kings.</div><div class="sentence"> For kings we may truly call those who possess royal science, whether they rule or not, as was shown in the previous argument.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">601</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Thank you for reminding me; and the consequence is that any true form of government can only be supposed to be the government of one, two, or, at any rate, of a few.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">602</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">603</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And these, whether they rule with the will, or against the will, of their subjects, with written laws or without written laws, and whether they are poor or rich, and whatever be the nature of their rule, must be supposed, according to our present view, to rule on some scientific principle; just as the physician, whether he cures us against our will or with our will, and whatever be his mode of treatment,—incision, burning, or the infliction of some other pain,—whether he practises out of a book or not out of a book, and whether he be rich or poor, whether he purges or reduces in some other way, or even fattens his patients, is a physician all the same, so long as he exercises authority over them according to rules of art, if he only does them good and heals and saves them.</div><div class="sentence"> And this we lay down to be the only proper test of the art of medicine, or of any other art of command.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">604</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">605</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then that can be the only true form of government in which the governors are really found to possess science, and are not mere pretenders, whether they rule according to law or without law, over willing or unwilling subjects, and are rich or poor themselves—none of these things can with any propriety be included in the notion of the ruler.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">606</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">607</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And whether with a view to the public good they purge the State by killing some, or exiling some; whether they reduce the size of the body corporate by sending out from the hive swarms of citizens, or, by introducing persons from without, increase it; while they act according to the rules of wisdom and justice, and use their power with a view to the general security and improvement, the city over which they rule, and which has these characteristics, may be described as the only true State.</div><div class="sentence"> All other governments are not genuine or real; but only imitations of this, and some of them are better and some of them are worse; the better are said to be well governed, but they are mere imitations like the others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">608</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I agree, Stranger, in the greater part of what you say; but as to their ruling without laws—the expression has a harsh sound.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">609</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  You have been too quick for me, Socrates; I was just going to ask you whether you objected to any of my statements.</div><div class="sentence"> And now I see that we shall have to consider this notion of there being good government without laws.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">610</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">611</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  There can be no doubt that legislation is in a manner the business of a king, and yet the best thing of all is not that the law should rule, but that a man should rule supposing him to have wisdom and royal power.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you see why this is?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">612</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">669</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The noble pilot and the wise physician, who 'is worth many another man'—in the similitude of these let us endeavour to discover some image of the king.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">671</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Well, such as this: —Every man will reflect that he suffers strange things at the hands of both of them; the physician saves any whom he wishes to save, and any whom he wishes to maltreat he maltreats—cutting or burning them; and at the same time requiring them to bring him payments, which are a sort of tribute, of which little or nothing is spent upon the sick man, and the greater part is consumed by him and his domestics; and the finale is that he receives money from the relations of the sick man or from some enemy of his, and puts him out of the way.</div><div class="sentence"> And the pilots of ships are guilty of numberless evil deeds of the same kind; they intentionally play false and leave you ashore when the hour of sailing arrives; or they cause mishaps at sea and cast away their freight; and are guilty of other rogueries.</div><div class="sentence"> Now suppose that we, bearing all this in mind, were to determine, after consideration, that neither of these arts shall any longer be allowed to exercise absolute control either over freemen or over slaves, but that we will summon an assembly either of all the people, or of the rich only, that anybody who likes, whatever may be his calling, or even if he have no calling, may offer an opinion either about seamanship or about diseases—whether as to the manner in which physic or surgical instruments are to be applied to the patient, or again about the vessels and the nautical implements which are required in navigation, and how to meet the dangers of winds and waves which are incidental to the voyage, how to behave when encountering pirates, and what is to be done with the old-fashioned galleys, if they have to fight with others of a similar build—and that, whatever shall be decreed by the multitude on these points, upon the advice of persons skilled or unskilled, shall be written down on triangular tablets and columns, or enacted although unwritten to be national customs; and that in all future time vessels shall be navigated and remedies administered to the patient after this fashion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">672</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What a strange notion!</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">716</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">717</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  I am speaking of the three forms of government, which I mentioned at the beginning of this discussion—monarchy, the rule of the few, and the rule of the many.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">718</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">719</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  If we divide each of these we shall have six, from which the true one may be distinguished as a seventh.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">720</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How would you make the division?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">721</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Monarchy divides into royalty and tyranny; the rule of the few into aristocracy, which has an auspicious name, and oligarchy; and democracy or the rule of the many, which before was one, must now be divided.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">722</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  On what principle of division?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">723</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  On the same principle as before, although the name is now discovered to have a twofold meaning.</div><div class="sentence"> For the distinction of ruling with law or without law, applies to this as well as to the rest.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">724</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">725</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The division made no difference when we were looking for the perfect State, as we showed before.</div><div class="sentence"> But now that this has been separated off, and, as we said, the others alone are left for us, the principle of law and the absence of law will bisect them all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">726</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That would seem to follow, from what has been said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">727</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then monarchy, when bound by good prescriptions or laws, is the best of all the six, and when lawless is the most bitter and oppressive to the subject.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">728</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">729</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The government of the few, which is intermediate between that of the one and many, is also intermediate in good and evil; but the government of the many is in every respect weak and unable to do either any great good or any great evil, when compared with the others, because the offices are too minutely subdivided and too many hold them.</div><div class="sentence"> And this therefore is the worst of all lawful governments, and the best of all lawless ones.</div><div class="sentence"> If they are all without the restraints of law, democracy is the form in which to live is best; if they are well ordered, then this is the last which you should choose, as royalty, the first form, is the best, with the exception of the seventh, for that excels them all, and is among States what God is among men.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">730</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You are quite right, and we should choose that above all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">731</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The members of all these States, with the exception of the one which has knowledge, may be set aside as being not Statesmen but partisans,—upholders of the most monstrous idols, and themselves idols; and, being the greatest imitators and magicians, they are also the greatest of Sophists.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">732</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The name of Sophist after many windings in the argument appears to have been most justly fixed upon the politicians, as they are termed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">733</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And so our satyric drama has been played out; and the troop of Centaurs and Satyrs, however unwilling to leave the stage, have at last been separated from the political science.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">734</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  So I perceive.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">735</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  There remain, however, natures still more troublesome, because they are more nearly akin to the king, and more difficult to discern; the examination of them may be compared to the process of refining gold.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">736</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What is your meaning?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">737</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The workmen begin by sifting away the earth and stones and the like; there remain in a confused mass the valuable elements akin to gold, which can only be separated by fire,—copper, silver, and other precious metal; these are at last refined away by the use of tests, until the gold is left quite pure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">738</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, that is the way in which these things are said to be done.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">739</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  In like manner, all alien and uncongenial matter has been separated from political science, and what is precious and of a kindred nature has been left; there remain the nobler arts of the general and the judge, and the higher sort of oratory which is an ally of the royal art, and persuades men to do justice, and assists in guiding the helm of States: —How can we best clear away all these, leaving him whom we seek alone and unalloyed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">740</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That is obviously what has in some way to be attempted.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">741</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  If the attempt is all that is wanting, he shall certainly be brought to light; and I think that the illustration of music may assist in exhibiting him.</div><div class="sentence"> Please to answer me a question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">742</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What question?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">743</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  There is such a thing as learning music or handicraft arts in general?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">744</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">745</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And is there any higher art or science, having power to decide which of these arts are and are not to be learned;—what do you say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">746</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I should answer that there is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">747</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And do we acknowledge this science to be different from the others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">748</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">749</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And ought the other sciences to be superior to this, or no single science to any other?</div><div class="sentence"> Or ought this science to be the overseer and governor of all the others?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">750</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The latter.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">751</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  You mean to say that the science which judges whether we ought to learn or not, must be superior to the science which is learned or which teaches?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">752</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Far superior.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">753</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And the science which determines whether we ought to persuade or not, must be superior to the science which is able to persuade?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">754</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">755</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Very good; and to what science do we assign the power of persuading a multitude by a pleasing tale and not by teaching?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">756</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That power, I think, must clearly be assigned to rhetoric.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">757</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And to what science do we give the power of determining whether we are to employ persuasion or force towards any one, or to refrain altogether?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">758</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  To that science which governs the arts of speech and persuasion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">759</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Which, if I am not mistaken, will be politics?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">760</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">761</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Rhetoric seems to be quickly distinguished from politics, being a different species, yet ministering to it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">762</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">763</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  But what would you think of another sort of power or science?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">764</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What science?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">765</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The science which has to do with military operations against our enemies—is that to be regarded as a science or not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">766</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How can generalship and military tactics be regarded as other than a science?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">767</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And is the art which is able and knows how to advise when we are to go to war, or to make peace, the same as this or different?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">768</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  If we are to be consistent, we must say different.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">769</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And we must also suppose that this rules the other, if we are not to give up our former notion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">770</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">771</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And, considering how great and terrible the whole art of war is, can we imagine any which is superior to it but the truly royal?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">772</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  No other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">773</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The art of the general is only ministerial, and therefore not political?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">774</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">775</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Once more let us consider the nature of the righteous judge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">776</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">777</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Does he do anything but decide the dealings of men with one another to be just or unjust in accordance with the standard which he receives from the king and legislator,—showing his own peculiar virtue only in this, that he is not perverted by gifts, or fears, or pity, or by any sort of favour or enmity, into deciding the suits of men with one another contrary to the appointment of the legislator?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">778</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  No; his office is such as you describe.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">779</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then the inference is that the power of the judge is not royal, but only the power of a guardian of the law which ministers to the royal power?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">780</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">781</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The review of all these sciences shows that none of them is political or royal.</div><div class="sentence"> For the truly royal ought not itself to act, but to rule over those who are able to act; the king ought to know what is and what is not a fitting opportunity for taking the initiative in matters of the greatest importance, whilst others should execute his orders.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">782</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">783</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And, therefore, the arts which we have described, as they have no authority over themselves or one another, but are each of them concerned with some special action of their own, have, as they ought to have, special names corresponding to their several actions.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">784</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">785</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And the science which is over them all, and has charge of the laws, and of all matters affecting the State, and truly weaves them all into one, if we would describe under a name characteristic of their common nature, most truly we may call politics.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">786</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">787</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then, now that we have discovered the various classes in a State, shall I analyse politics after the pattern which weaving supplied?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">788</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I greatly wish that you would.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">789</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then I must describe the nature of the royal web, and show how the various threads are woven into one piece.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">790</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">791</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  A task has to be accomplished, which, although difficult, appears to be necessary.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">792</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly the attempt must be made.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">793</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  To assume that one part of virtue differs in kind from another, is a position easily assailable by contentious disputants, who appeal to popular opinion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">794</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I do not understand.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">795</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Let me put the matter in another way:  I suppose that you would consider courage to be a part of virtue?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">796</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly I should.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">797</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And you would think temperance to be different from courage; and likewise to be a part of virtue?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">798</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">799</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  I shall venture to put forward a strange theory about them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">800</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">801</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  That they are two principles which thoroughly hate one another and are antagonistic throughout a great part of nature.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">802</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How singular!</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">803</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, very—for all the parts of virtue are commonly said to be friendly to one another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">804</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">805</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then let us carefully investigate whether this is universally true, or whether there are not parts of virtue which are at war with their kindred in some respect.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">806</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Tell me how we shall consider that question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">807</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  We must extend our enquiry to all those things which we consider beautiful and at the same time place in two opposite classes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">808</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Explain; what are they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">809</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Acuteness and quickness, whether in body or soul or in the movement of sound, and the imitations of them which painting and music supply, you must have praised yourself before now, or been present when others praised them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">810</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">811</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And do you remember the terms in which they are praised?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">812</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I do not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">813</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  I wonder whether I can explain to you in words the thought which is passing in my mind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">814</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">815</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  You fancy that this is all so easy:  Well, let us consider these notions with reference to the opposite classes of action under which they fall.</div><div class="sentence"> When we praise quickness and energy and acuteness, whether of mind or body or sound, we express our praise of the quality which we admire by one word, and that one word is manliness or courage.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">816</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">817</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  We speak of an action as energetic and brave, quick and manly, and vigorous too; and when we apply the name of which I speak as the common attribute of all these natures, we certainly praise them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">818</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">819</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And do we not often praise the quiet strain of action also?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">820</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">821</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And do we not then say the opposite of what we said of the other?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">822</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">823</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  We exclaim How calm!</div><div class="sentence"> How temperate!</div><div class="sentence"> in admiration of the slow and quiet working of the intellect, and of steadiness and gentleness in action, of smoothness and depth of voice, and of all rhythmical movement and of music in general, when these have a proper solemnity.</div><div class="sentence"> Of all such actions we predicate not courage, but a name indicative of order.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">824</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">825</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  But when, on the other hand, either of these is out of place, the names of either are changed into terms of censure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">826</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">827</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Too great sharpness or quickness or hardness is termed violence or madness; too great slowness or gentleness is called cowardice or sluggishness; and we may observe, that for the most part these qualities, and the temperance and manliness of the opposite characters, are arrayed as enemies on opposite sides, and do not mingle with one another in their respective actions; and if we pursue the enquiry, we shall find that men who have these different qualities of mind differ from one another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">828</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In what respect?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">829</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  In respect of all the qualities which I mentioned, and very likely of many others.</div><div class="sentence"> According to their respective affinities to either class of actions they distribute praise and blame,—praise to the actions which are akin to their own, blame to those of the opposite party—and out of this many quarrels and occasions of quarrel arise among them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">830</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">831</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The difference between the two classes is often a trivial concern; but in a state, and when affecting really important matters, becomes of all disorders the most hateful.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">832</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  To what do you refer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">833</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  To nothing short of the whole regulation of human life.</div><div class="sentence"> For the orderly class are always ready to lead a peaceful life, quietly doing their own business; this is their manner of behaving with all men at home, and they are equally ready to find some way of keeping the peace with foreign States.</div><div class="sentence"> And on account of this fondness of theirs for peace, which is often out of season where their influence prevails, they become by degrees unwarlike, and bring up their young men to be like themselves; they are at the mercy of their enemies; whence in a few years they and their children and the whole city often pass imperceptibly from the condition of freemen into that of slaves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">834</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What a cruel fate!</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">835</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And now think of what happens with the more courageous natures.</div><div class="sentence"> Are they not always inciting their country to go to war, owing to their excessive love of the military life?</div><div class="sentence"> they raise up enemies against themselves many and mighty, and either utterly ruin their native-land or enslave and subject it to its foes?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">836</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That, again, is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">837</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Must we not admit, then, that where these two classes exist, they always feel the greatest antipathy and antagonism towards one another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">838</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  We cannot deny it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">839</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And returning to the enquiry with which we began, have we not found that considerable portions of virtue are at variance with one another, and give rise to a similar opposition in the characters who are endowed with them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">840</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">841</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Let us consider a further point.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">842</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What is it?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">844</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  To, be sure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">845</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Then the true and natural art of statesmanship will never allow any State to be formed by a combination of good and bad men, if this can be avoided; but will begin by testing human natures in play, and after testing them, will entrust them to proper teachers who are the ministers of her purposes—she will herself give orders, and maintain authority; just as the art of weaving continually gives orders and maintains authority over the carders and all the others who prepare the material for the work, commanding the subsidiary arts to execute the works which she deems necessary for making the web.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">846</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">848</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That is commonly said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">849</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  But those who are wallowing in ignorance and baseness she bows under the yoke of slavery.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">850</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Quite right.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">852</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In what manner?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">853</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  First of all, she takes the eternal element of the soul and binds it with a divine cord, to which it is akin, and then the animal nature, and binds that with human cords.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">854</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I do not understand what you mean.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">855</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The meaning is, that the opinion about the honourable and the just and good and their opposites, which is true and confirmed by reason, is a divine principle, and when implanted in the soul, is implanted, as I maintain, in a nature of heavenly birth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">856</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; what else should it be?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">857</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Only the Statesman and the good legislator, having the inspiration of the royal muse, can implant this opinion, and he, only in the rightly educated, whom we were just now describing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">858</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Likely enough.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">859</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  But him who cannot, we will not designate by any of the names which are the subject of the present enquiry.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">860</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">861</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The courageous soul when attaining this truth becomes civilized, and rendered more capable of partaking of justice; but when not partaking, is inclined to brutality.</div><div class="sentence"> Is not that true?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">862</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">863</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And again, the peaceful and orderly nature, if sharing in these opinions, becomes temperate and wise, as far as this may be in a State, but if not, deservedly obtains the ignominious name of silliness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">864</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">865</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Can we say that such a connexion as this will lastingly unite the evil with one another or with the good, or that any science would seriously think of using a bond of this kind to join such materials?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">866</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">867</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  But in those who were originally of a noble nature, and who have been nurtured in noble ways, and in those only, may we not say that union is implanted by law, and that this is the medicine which art prescribes for them, and of all the bonds which unite the dissimilar and contrary parts of virtue is not this, as I was saying, the divinest?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">868</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">869</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Where this divine bond exists there is no difficulty in imagining, or when you have imagined, in creating the other bonds, which are human only.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">870</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How is that, and what bonds do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">871</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Rights of intermarriage, and ties which are formed between States by giving and taking children in marriage, or between individuals by private betrothals and espousals.</div><div class="sentence"> For most persons form marriage connexions without due regard to what is best for the procreation of children.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">872</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In what way?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">873</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  They seek after wealth and power, which in matrimony are objects not worthy even of a serious censure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">874</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There is no need to consider them at all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">875</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  More reason is there to consider the practice of those who make family their chief aim, and to indicate their error.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">876</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">877</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  They act on no true principle at all; they seek their ease and receive with open arms those who are like themselves, and hate those who are unlike them, being too much influenced by feelings of dislike.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">878</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">879</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The quiet orderly class seek for natures like their own, and as far as they can they marry and give in marriage exclusively in this class, and the courageous do the same; they seek natures like their own, whereas they should both do precisely the opposite.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">880</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How and why is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">881</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Because courage, when untempered by the gentler nature during many generations, may at first bloom and strengthen, but at last bursts forth into downright madness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">882</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Like enough.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">883</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  And then, again, the soul which is over-full of modesty and has no element of courage in many successive generations, is apt to grow too indolent, and at last to become utterly paralyzed and useless.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">884</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That, again, is quite likely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">885</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  It was of these bonds I said that there would be no difficulty in creating them, if only both classes originally held the same opinion about the honourable and good;—indeed, in this single work, the whole process of royal weaving is comprised—never to allow temperate natures to be separated from the brave, but to weave them together, like the warp and the woof, by common sentiments and honours and reputation, and by the giving of pledges to one another; and out of them forming one smooth and even web, to entrust to them the offices of State.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">886</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">887</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  Where one officer only is needed, you must choose a ruler who has both these qualities—when many, you must mingle some of each, for the temperate ruler is very careful and just and safe, but is wanting in thoroughness and go.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">888</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly, that is very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">889</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  The character of the courageous, on the other hand, falls short of the former in justice and caution, but has the power of action in a remarkable degree, and where either of these two qualities is wanting, there cities cannot altogether prosper either in their public or private life.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">890</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly they cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">891</span><div class="speaker">STRANGER</div><div class="sentence">  This then we declare to be the completion of the web of political action, which is created by a direct intertexture of the brave and temperate natures, whenever the royal science has drawn the two minds into communion with one another by unanimity and friendship, and having perfected the noblest and best of all the webs which political life admits, and enfolding therein all other inhabitants of cities, whether slaves or freemen, binds them in one fabric and governs and presides over them, and, in so far as to be happy is vouchsafed to a city, in no particular fails to secure their happiness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">892</span><div class="speaker">YOUNG SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Your picture, Stranger, of the king and statesman, no less than of the Sophist, is quite perfect.</div></div>
