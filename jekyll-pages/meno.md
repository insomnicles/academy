<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  This Dialogue begins abruptly with a question of Meno, who asks, 'whether virtue can be taught.'</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates replies that he does not as yet know what virtue is, and has never known anyone who did.</div><div class="sentence"> 'Then he cannot have met Gorgias when he was at Athens.'</div><div class="sentence"> Yes, Socrates had met him, but he has a bad memory, and has forgotten what Gorgias said.</div><div class="sentence"> Will Meno tell him his own notion, which is probably not very different from that of Gorgias?</div><div class="sentence"> 'O yes—nothing easier: there is the virtue of a man, of a woman, of an old man, and of a child; there is a virtue of every age and state of life, all of which may be easily described.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates reminds Meno that this is only an enumeration of the virtues and not a definition of the notion which is common to them all.</div><div class="sentence"> In a second attempt Meno defines virtue to be 'the power of command.'</div><div class="sentence"> But to this, again, exceptions are taken.</div><div class="sentence"> For there must be a virtue of those who obey, as well as of those who command; and the power of command must be justly or not unjustly exercised.</div><div class="sentence"> Meno is very ready to admit that justice is virtue: 'Would you say virtue or a virtue, for there are other virtues, such as courage, temperance, and the like; just as round is a figure, and black and white are colours, and yet there are other figures and other colours.</div><div class="sentence"> Let Meno take the examples of figure and colour, and try to define them.'</div><div class="sentence"> Meno confesses his inability, and after a process of interrogation, in which Socrates explains to him the nature of a 'simile in multis,' Socrates himself defines figure as 'the accompaniment of colour.'</div><div class="sentence"> But some one may object that he does not know the meaning of the word 'colour;' and if he is a candid friend, and not a mere disputant, Socrates is willing to furnish him with a simpler and more philosophical definition, into which no disputed word is allowed to intrude: 'Figure is the limit of form.'</div><div class="sentence"> Meno imperiously insists that he must still have a definition of colour.</div><div class="sentence"> Some raillery follows; and at length Socrates is induced to reply, 'that colour is the effluence of form, sensible, and in due proportion to the sight.'</div><div class="sentence"> This definition is exactly suited to the taste of Meno, who welcomes the familiar language of Gorgias and Empedocles.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates is of opinion that the more abstract or dialectical definition of figure is far better.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  Now that Meno has been made to understand the nature of a general definition, he answers in the spirit of a Greek gentleman, and in the words of a poet, 'that virtue is to delight in things honourable, and to have the power of getting them.'</div><div class="sentence"> This is a nearer approximation than he has yet made to a complete definition, and, regarded as a piece of proverbial or popular morality, is not far from the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> But the objection is urged, 'that the honourable is the good,' and as every one equally desires the good, the point of the definition is contained in the words, 'the power of getting them.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'And they must be got justly or with justice.'</div><div class="sentence"> The definition will then stand thus: 'Virtue is the power of getting good with justice.'</div><div class="sentence"> But justice is a part of virtue, and therefore virtue is the getting of good with a part of virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> The definition repeats the word defined.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  Meno complains that the conversation of Socrates has the effect of a torpedo's shock upon him.</div><div class="sentence"> When he talks with other persons he has plenty to say about virtue; in the presence of Socrates, his thoughts desert him.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates replies that he is only the cause of perplexity in others, because he is himself perplexed.</div><div class="sentence"> He proposes to continue the enquiry.</div><div class="sentence"> But how, asks Meno, can he enquire either into what he knows or into what he does not know?</div><div class="sentence"> This is a sophistical puzzle, which, as Socrates remarks, saves a great deal of trouble to him who accepts it.</div><div class="sentence"> But the puzzle has a real difficulty latent under it, to which Socrates will endeavour to find a reply.</div><div class="sentence"> The difficulty is the origin of knowledge:—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  He has heard from priests and priestesses, and from the poet Pindar, of an immortal soul which is born again and again in successive periods of existence, returning into this world when she has paid the penalty of ancient crime, and, having wandered over all places of the upper and under world, and seen and known all things at one time or other, is by association out of one thing capable of recovering all.</div><div class="sentence"> For nature is of one kindred; and every soul has a seed or germ which may be developed into all knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> The existence of this latent knowledge is further proved by the interrogation of one of Meno's slaves, who, in the skilful hands of Socrates, is made to acknowledge some elementary relations of geometrical figures.</div><div class="sentence"> The theorem that the square of the diagonal is double the square of the side—that famous discovery of primitive mathematics, in honour of which the legendary Pythagoras is said to have sacrificed a hecatomb—is elicited from him.</div><div class="sentence"> The first step in the process of teaching has made him conscious of his own ignorance.</div><div class="sentence"> He has had the 'torpedo's shock' given him, and is the better for the operation.</div><div class="sentence"> But whence had the uneducated man this knowledge?</div><div class="sentence"> He had never learnt geometry in this world; nor was it born with him; he must therefore have had it when he was not a man.</div><div class="sentence"> And as he always either was or was not a man, he must have always had it.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Phaedo.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  After Socrates has given this specimen of the true nature of teaching, the original question of the teachableness of virtue is renewed.</div><div class="sentence"> Again he professes a desire to know 'what virtue is' first.</div><div class="sentence"> But he is willing to argue the question, as mathematicians say, under an hypothesis.</div><div class="sentence"> He will assume that if virtue is knowledge, then virtue can be taught.</div><div class="sentence"> (This was the stage of the argument at which the Protagoras concluded.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates has no difficulty in showing that virtue is a good, and that goods, whether of body or mind, must be under the direction of knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> Upon the assumption just made, then, virtue is teachable.</div><div class="sentence"> But where are the teachers?</div><div class="sentence"> There are none to be found.</div><div class="sentence"> This is extremely discouraging.</div><div class="sentence"> Virtue is no sooner discovered to be teachable, than the discovery follows that it is not taught.</div><div class="sentence"> Virtue, therefore, is and is not teachable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  In this dilemma an appeal is made to Anytus, a respectable and well-to-do citizen of the old school, and a family friend of Meno, who happens to be present.</div><div class="sentence"> He is asked 'whether Meno shall go to the Sophists and be taught.'</div><div class="sentence"> The suggestion throws him into a rage.</div><div class="sentence"> 'To whom, then, shall Meno go?'</div><div class="sentence"> asks Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> To any Athenian gentleman—to the great Athenian statesmen of past times.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates replies here, as elsewhere (Laches, Prot.</div><div class="sentence"> ), that Themistocles, Pericles, and other great men, had sons to whom they would surely, if they could have done so, have imparted their own political wisdom; but no one ever heard that these sons of theirs were remarkable for anything except riding and wrestling and similar accomplishments.</div><div class="sentence"> Anytus is angry at the imputation which is cast on his favourite statesmen, and on a class to which he supposes himself to belong; he breaks off with a significant hint.</div><div class="sentence"> The mention of another opportunity of talking with him, and the suggestion that Meno may do the Athenian people a service by pacifying him, are evident allusions to the trial of Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span> <div class="sentence">  Socrates returns to the consideration of the question 'whether virtue is teachable,' which was denied on the ground that there are no teachers of it: (for the Sophists are bad teachers, and the rest of the world do not profess to teach).</div><div class="sentence"> But there is another point which we failed to observe, and in which Gorgias has never instructed Meno, nor Prodicus Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> This is the nature of right opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> For virtue may be under the guidance of right opinion as well as of knowledge; and right opinion is for practical purposes as good as knowledge, but is incapable of being taught, and is also liable, like the images of Daedalus, to 'walk off,' because not bound by the tie of the cause.</div><div class="sentence"> This is the sort of instinct which is possessed by statesmen, who are not wise or knowing persons, but only inspired or divine.</div><div class="sentence"> The higher virtue, which is identical with knowledge, is an ideal only.</div><div class="sentence"> If the statesman had this knowledge, and could teach what he knew, he would be like Tiresias in the world below,—'he alone has wisdom, but the rest flit like shadows.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span> <div class="sentence">  This Dialogue is an attempt to answer the question, Can virtue be taught?</div><div class="sentence"> No one would either ask or answer such a question in modern times.</div><div class="sentence"> But in the age of Socrates it was only by an effort that the mind could rise to a general notion of virtue as distinct from the particular virtues of courage, liberality, and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> And when a hazy conception of this ideal was attained, it was only by a further effort that the question of the teachableness of virtue could be resolved.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span> <div class="sentence">  The answer which is given by Plato is paradoxical enough, and seems rather intended to stimulate than to satisfy enquiry.</div><div class="sentence"> Virtue is knowledge, and therefore virtue can be taught.</div><div class="sentence"> But virtue is not taught, and therefore in this higher and ideal sense there is no virtue and no knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> The teaching of the Sophists is confessedly inadequate, and Meno, who is their pupil, is ignorant of the very nature of general terms.</div><div class="sentence"> He can only produce out of their armoury the sophism, 'that you can neither enquire into what you know nor into what you do not know;' to which Socrates replies by his theory of reminiscence.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span> <div class="sentence">  To the doctrine that virtue is knowledge, Plato has been constantly tending in the previous Dialogues.</div><div class="sentence"> But the new truth is no sooner found than it vanishes away.</div><div class="sentence"> 'If there is knowledge, there must be teachers; and where are the teachers?'</div><div class="sentence"> There is no knowledge in the higher sense of systematic, connected, reasoned knowledge, such as may one day be attained, and such as Plato himself seems to see in some far off vision of a single science.</div><div class="sentence"> And there are no teachers in the higher sense of the word; that is to say, no real teachers who will arouse the spirit of enquiry in their pupils, and not merely instruct them in rhetoric or impart to them ready-made information for a fee of 'one' or of 'fifty drachms.'</div><div class="sentence"> Plato is desirous of deepening the notion of education, and therefore he asserts the paradox that there are no educators.</div><div class="sentence"> This paradox, though different in form, is not really different from the remark which is often made in modern times by those who would depreciate either the methods of education commonly employed, or the standard attained—that 'there is no true education among us.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span> <div class="sentence">  There remains still a possibility which must not be overlooked.</div><div class="sentence"> Even if there be no true knowledge, as is proved by 'the wretched state of education,' there may be right opinion, which is a sort of guessing or divination resting on no knowledge of causes, and incommunicable to others.</div><div class="sentence"> This is the gift which our statesmen have, as is proved by the circumstance that they are unable to impart their knowledge to their sons.</div><div class="sentence"> Those who are possessed of it cannot be said to be men of science or philosophers, but they are inspired and divine.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span> <div class="sentence">  There may be some trace of irony in this curious passage, which forms the concluding portion of the Dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> But Plato certainly does not mean to intimate that the supernatural or divine is the true basis of human life.</div><div class="sentence"> To him knowledge, if only attainable in this world, is of all things the most divine.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet, like other philosophers, he is willing to admit that 'probability is the guide of life (Butler's Analogy.</div><div class="sentence"> );' and he is at the same time desirous of contrasting the wisdom which governs the world with a higher wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> There are many instincts, judgments, and anticipations of the human mind which cannot be reduced to rule, and of which the grounds cannot always be given in words.</div><div class="sentence"> A person may have some skill or latent experience which he is able to use himself and is yet unable to teach others, because he has no principles, and is incapable of collecting or arranging his ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> He has practice, but not theory; art, but not science.</div><div class="sentence"> This is a true fact of psychology, which is recognized by Plato in this passage.</div><div class="sentence"> But he is far from saying, as some have imagined, that inspiration or divine grace is to be regarded as higher than knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> He would not have preferred the poet or man of action to the philosopher, or the virtue of custom to the virtue based upon ideas.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span> <div class="sentence">  Also here, as in the Ion and Phaedrus, Plato appears to acknowledge an unreasoning element in the higher nature of man.</div><div class="sentence"> The philosopher only has knowledge, and yet the statesman and the poet are inspired.</div><div class="sentence"> There may be a sort of irony in regarding in this way the gifts of genius.</div><div class="sentence"> But there is no reason to suppose that he is deriding them, any more than he is deriding the phenomena of love or of enthusiasm in the Symposium, or of oracles in the Apology, or of divine intimations when he is speaking of the daemonium of Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> He recognizes the lower form of right opinion, as well as the higher one of science, in the spirit of one who desires to include in his philosophy every aspect of human life; just as he recognizes the existence of popular opinion as a fact, and the Sophists as the expression of it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span> <div class="sentence">  This Dialogue contains the first intimation of the doctrine of reminiscence and of the immortality of the soul.</div><div class="sentence"> The proof is very slight, even slighter than in the Phaedo and Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> Because men had abstract ideas in a previous state, they must have always had them, and their souls therefore must have always existed.</div><div class="sentence"> For they must always have been either men or not men.</div><div class="sentence"> The fallacy of the latter words is transparent.</div><div class="sentence"> And Socrates himself appears to be conscious of their weakness; for he adds immediately afterwards, 'I have said some things of which I am not altogether confident.'</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Phaedo.)</div><div class="sentence"> It may be observed, however, that the fanciful notion of pre-existence is combined with a true but partial view of the origin and unity of knowledge, and of the association of ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> Knowledge is prior to any particular knowledge, and exists not in the previous state of the individual, but of the race.</div><div class="sentence"> It is potential, not actual, and can only be appropriated by strenuous exertion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span> <div class="sentence">  The idealism of Plato is here presented in a less developed form than in the Phaedo and Phaedrus.</div><div class="sentence"> Nothing is said of the pre-existence of ideas of justice, temperance, and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor is Socrates positive of anything but the duty of enquiry.</div><div class="sentence"> The doctrine of reminiscence too is explained more in accordance with fact and experience as arising out of the affinities of nature (ate tes thuseos oles suggenous ouses).</div><div class="sentence"> Modern philosophy says that all things in nature are dependent on one another; the ancient philosopher had the same truth latent in his mind when he affirmed that out of one thing all the rest may be recovered.</div><div class="sentence"> The subjective was converted by him into an objective; the mental phenomenon of the association of ideas (compare Phaedo) became a real chain of existences.</div><div class="sentence"> The germs of two valuable principles of education may also be gathered from the 'words of priests and priestesses:' (1) that true knowledge is a knowledge of causes (compare Aristotle's theory of episteme); and (2) that the process of learning consists not in what is brought to the learner, but in what is drawn out of him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span> <div class="sentence">  Some lesser points of the dialogue may be noted, such as (1) the acute observation that Meno prefers the familiar definition, which is embellished with poetical language, to the better and truer one; or (2) the shrewd reflection, which may admit of an application to modern as well as to ancient teachers, that the Sophists having made large fortunes; this must surely be a criterion of their powers of teaching, for that no man could get a living by shoemaking who was not a good shoemaker; or (3) the remark conveyed, almost in a word, that the verbal sceptic is saved the labour of thought and enquiry (ouden dei to toiouto zeteseos).</div><div class="sentence"> Characteristic also of the temper of the Socratic enquiry is, (4) the proposal to discuss the teachableness of virtue under an hypothesis, after the manner of the mathematicians; and (5) the repetition of the favourite doctrine which occurs so frequently in the earlier and more Socratic Dialogues, and gives a colour to all of them—that mankind only desire evil through ignorance; (6) the experiment of eliciting from the slave-boy the mathematical truth which is latent in him, and (7) the remark that he is all the better for knowing his ignorance.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span> <div class="sentence">  The character of Meno, like that of Critias, has no relation to the actual circumstances of his life.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato is silent about his treachery to the ten thousand Greeks, which Xenophon has recorded, as he is also silent about the crimes of Critias.</div><div class="sentence"> He is a Thessalian Alcibiades, rich and luxurious—a spoilt child of fortune, and is described as the hereditary friend of the great king.</div><div class="sentence"> Like Alcibiades he is inspired with an ardent desire of knowledge, and is equally willing to learn of Socrates and of the Sophists.</div><div class="sentence"> He may be regarded as standing in the same relation to Gorgias as Hippocrates in the Protagoras to the other great Sophist.</div><div class="sentence"> He is the sophisticated youth on whom Socrates tries his cross-examining powers, just as in the Charmides, the Lysis, and the Euthydemus, ingenuous boyhood is made the subject of a similar experiment.</div><div class="sentence"> He is treated by Socrates in a half-playful manner suited to his character; at the same time he appears not quite to understand the process to which he is being subjected.</div><div class="sentence"> For he is exhibited as ignorant of the very elements of dialectics, in which the Sophists have failed to instruct their disciple.</div><div class="sentence"> His definition of virtue as 'the power and desire of attaining things honourable,' like the first definition of justice in the Republic, is taken from a poet.</div><div class="sentence"> His answers have a sophistical ring, and at the same time show the sophistical incapacity to grasp a general notion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span> <div class="sentence">  Anytus is the type of the narrow-minded man of the world, who is indignant at innovation, and equally detests the popular teacher and the true philosopher.</div><div class="sentence"> He seems, like Aristophanes, to regard the new opinions, whether of Socrates or the Sophists, as fatal to Athenian greatness.</div><div class="sentence"> He is of the same class as Callicles in the Gorgias, but of a different variety; the immoral and sophistical doctrines of Callicles are not attributed to him.</div><div class="sentence"> The moderation with which he is described is remarkable, if he be the accuser of Socrates, as is apparently indicated by his parting words.</div><div class="sentence"> Perhaps Plato may have been desirous of showing that the accusation of Socrates was not to be attributed to badness or malevolence, but rather to a tendency in men's minds.</div><div class="sentence"> Or he may have been regardless of the historical truth of the characters of his dialogue, as in the case of Meno and Critias.</div><div class="sentence"> Like Chaerephon (Apol.)</div><div class="sentence"> the real Anytus was a democrat, and had joined Thrasybulus in the conflict with the thirty.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span> <div class="sentence">  The Protagoras arrived at a sort of hypothetical conclusion, that if 'virtue is knowledge, it can be taught.'</div><div class="sentence"> In the Euthydemus, Socrates himself offered an example of the manner in which the true teacher may draw out the mind of youth; this was in contrast to the quibbling follies of the Sophists.</div><div class="sentence"> In the Meno the subject is more developed; the foundations of the enquiry are laid deeper, and the nature of knowledge is more distinctly explained.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a progression by antagonism of two opposite aspects of philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> But at the moment when we approach nearest, the truth doubles upon us and passes out of our reach.</div><div class="sentence"> We seem to find that the ideal of knowledge is irreconcilable with experience.</div><div class="sentence"> In human life there is indeed the profession of knowledge, but right opinion is our actual guide.</div><div class="sentence"> There is another sort of progress from the general notions of Socrates, who asked simply, 'what is friendship?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'what is temperance?'</div><div class="sentence"> 'what is courage?'</div><div class="sentence"> as in the Lysis, Charmides, Laches, to the transcendentalism of Plato, who, in the second stage of his philosophy, sought to find the nature of knowledge in a prior and future state of existence.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span> <div class="sentence">  The difficulty in framing general notions which has appeared in this and in all the previous Dialogues recurs in the Gorgias and Theaetetus as well as in the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> In the Gorgias too the statesmen reappear, but in stronger opposition to the philosopher.</div><div class="sentence"> They are no longer allowed to have a divine insight, but, though acknowledged to have been clever men and good speakers, are denounced as 'blind leaders of the blind.'</div><div class="sentence"> The doctrine of the immortality of the soul is also carried further, being made the foundation not only of a theory of knowledge, but of a doctrine of rewards and punishments.</div><div class="sentence"> In the Republic the relation of knowledge to virtue is described in a manner more consistent with modern distinctions.</div><div class="sentence"> The existence of the virtues without the possession of knowledge in the higher or philosophical sense is admitted to be possible.</div><div class="sentence"> Right opinion is again introduced in the Theaetetus as an account of knowledge, but is rejected on the ground that it is irrational (as here, because it is not bound by the tie of the cause), and also because the conception of false opinion is given up as hopeless.</div><div class="sentence"> The doctrines of Plato are necessarily different at different times of his life, as new distinctions are realized, or new stages of thought attained by him.</div><div class="sentence"> We are not therefore justified, in order to take away the appearance of inconsistency, in attributing to him hidden meanings or remote allusions.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span> <div class="sentence">  There are no external criteria by which we can determine the date of the Meno.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no reason to suppose that any of the Dialogues of Plato were written before the death of Socrates; the Meno, which appears to be one of the earliest of them, is proved to have been of a later date by the allusion of Anytus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span> <div class="sentence">  We cannot argue that Plato was more likely to have written, as he has done, of Meno before than after his miserable death; for we have already seen, in the examples of Charmides and Critias, that the characters in Plato are very far from resembling the same characters in history.</div><div class="sentence"> The repulsive picture which is given of him in the Anabasis of Xenophon, where he also appears as the friend of Aristippus 'and a fair youth having lovers,' has no other trait of likeness to the Meno of Plato.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span> <div class="sentence">  The place of the Meno in the series is doubtfully indicated by internal evidence.</div><div class="sentence"> The main character of the Dialogue is Socrates; but to the 'general definitions' of Socrates is added the Platonic doctrine of reminiscence.</div><div class="sentence"> The problems of virtue and knowledge have been discussed in the Lysis, Laches, Charmides, and Protagoras; the puzzle about knowing and learning has already appeared in the Euthydemus.</div><div class="sentence"> The doctrines of immortality and pre-existence are carried further in the Phaedrus and Phaedo; the distinction between opinion and knowledge is more fully developed in the Theaetetus.</div><div class="sentence"> The lessons of Prodicus, whom he facetiously calls his master, are still running in the mind of Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> Unlike the later Platonic Dialogues, the Meno arrives at no conclusion.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence we are led to place the Dialogue at some point of time later than the Protagoras, and earlier than the Phaedrus and Gorgias.</div><div class="sentence"> The place which is assigned to it in this work is due mainly to the desire to bring together in a single volume all the Dialogues which contain allusions to the trial and death of Socrates.</div></div>

<h2>ON THE IDEAS OF PLATO.</h2>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span> <div class="sentence">  A like remark applies to David Hume, of whose philosophy the central principle is the denial of the relation of cause and effect.</div><div class="sentence"> He would deprive men of a familiar term which they can ill afford to lose; but he seems not to have observed that this alteration is merely verbal and does not in any degree affect the nature of things.</div><div class="sentence"> Still less did he remark that he was arguing from the necessary imperfection of language against the most certain facts.</div><div class="sentence"> And here, again, we may find a parallel with the ancients.</div><div class="sentence"> He goes beyond facts in his scepticism, as they did in their idealism.</div><div class="sentence"> Like the ancient Sophists, he relegates the more important principles of ethics to custom and probability.</div><div class="sentence"> But crude and unmeaning as this philosophy is, it exercised a great influence on his successors, not unlike that which Locke exercised upon Berkeley and Berkeley upon Hume himself.</div><div class="sentence"> All three were both sceptical and ideal in almost equal degrees.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither they nor their predecessors had any true conception of language or of the history of philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> Hume's paradox has been forgotten by the world, and did not any more than the scepticism of the ancients require to be seriously refuted.</div><div class="sentence"> Like some other philosophical paradoxes, it would have been better left to die out.</div><div class="sentence"> It certainly could not be refuted by a philosophy such as Kant's, in which, no less than in the previously mentioned systems, the history of the human mind and the nature of language are almost wholly ignored, and the certainty of objective knowledge is transferred to the subject; while absolute truth is reduced to a figment, more abstract and narrow than Plato's ideas, of 'thing in itself,' to which, if we reason strictly, no predicate can be applied.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span> <div class="sentence">  The question which Plato has raised respecting the origin and nature of ideas belongs to the infancy of philosophy; in modern times it would no longer be asked.</div><div class="sentence"> Their origin is only their history, so far as we know it; there can be no other.</div><div class="sentence"> We may trace them in language, in philosophy, in mythology, in poetry, but we cannot argue a priori about them.</div><div class="sentence"> We may attempt to shake them off, but they are always returning, and in every sphere of science and human action are tending to go beyond facts.</div><div class="sentence"> They are thought to be innate, because they have been familiar to us all our lives, and we can no longer dismiss them from our mind.</div><div class="sentence"> Many of them express relations of terms to which nothing exactly or nothing at all in rerum natura corresponds.</div><div class="sentence"> We are not such free agents in the use of them as we sometimes imagine.</div><div class="sentence"> Fixed ideas have taken the most complete possession of some thinkers who have been most determined to renounce them, and have been vehemently affirmed when they could be least explained and were incapable of proof.</div><div class="sentence"> The world has often been led away by a word to which no distinct meaning could be attached.</div><div class="sentence"> Abstractions such as 'authority,' 'equality,' 'utility,' 'liberty,' 'pleasure,' 'experience,' 'consciousness,' 'chance,' 'substance,' 'matter,' 'atom,' and a heap of other metaphysical and theological terms, are the source of quite as much error and illusion and have as little relation to actual facts as the ideas of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> Few students of theology or philosophy have sufficiently reflected how quickly the bloom of a philosophy passes away; or how hard it is for one age to understand the writings of another; or how nice a judgment is required of those who are seeking to express the philosophy of one age in the terms of another.</div><div class="sentence"> The 'eternal truths' of which metaphysicians speak have hardly ever lasted more than a generation.</div><div class="sentence"> In our own day schools or systems of philosophy which have once been famous have died before the founders of them.</div><div class="sentence"> We are still, as in Plato's age, groping about for a new method more comprehensive than any of those which now prevail; and also more permanent.</div><div class="sentence"> And we seem to see at a distance the promise of such a method, which can hardly be any other than the method of idealized experience, having roots which strike far down into the history of philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> It is a method which does not divorce the present from the past, or the part from the whole, or the abstract from the concrete, or theory from fact, or the divine from the human, or one science from another, but labours to connect them.</div><div class="sentence"> Along such a road we have proceeded a few steps, sufficient, perhaps, to make us reflect on the want of method which prevails in our own day.</div><div class="sentence"> In another age, all the branches of knowledge, whether relating to God or man or nature, will become the knowledge of 'the revelation of a single science' (Symp.</div><div class="sentence"> ), and all things, like the stars in heaven, will shed their light upon one another.</div></div>

<div class="book_description">PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:</div> Meno, Socrates, A Slave of Meno (Boy), Anytus. 
</div><div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Can you tell me, Socrates, whether virtue is acquired by teaching or by practice; or if neither by teaching nor by practice, then whether it comes to man by nature, or in what other way?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  O Meno, there was a time when the Thessalians were famous among the other Hellenes only for their riches and their riding; but now, if I am not mistaken, they are equally famous for their wisdom, especially at Larisa, which is the native city of your friend Aristippus.</div><div class="sentence"> And this is Gorgias' doing; for when he came there, the flower of the Aleuadae, among them your admirer Aristippus, and the other chiefs of the Thessalians, fell in love with his wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> And he has taught you the habit of answering questions in a grand and bold style, which becomes those who know, and is the style in which he himself answers all comers; and any Hellene who likes may ask him anything.</div><div class="sentence"> How different is our lot!</div><div class="sentence"> my dear Meno.</div><div class="sentence"> Here at Athens there is a dearth of the commodity, and all wisdom seems to have emigrated from us to you.</div><div class="sentence"> I am certain that if you were to ask any Athenian whether virtue was natural or acquired, he would laugh in your face, and say:  'Stranger, you have far too good an opinion of me, if you think that I can answer your question.</div><div class="sentence"> For I literally do not know what virtue is, and much less whether it is acquired by teaching or not.'</div><div class="sentence"> And I myself, Meno, living as I do in this region of poverty, am as poor as the rest of the world; and I confess with shame that I know literally nothing about virtue; and when I do not know the 'quid' of anything how can I know the 'quale'?</div><div class="sentence"> How, if I knew nothing at all of Meno, could I tell if he was fair, or the opposite of fair; rich and noble, or the reverse of rich and noble?</div><div class="sentence"> Do you think that I could?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  No, indeed.</div><div class="sentence"> But are you in earnest, Socrates, in saying that you do not know what virtue is?</div><div class="sentence"> And am I to carry back this report of you to Thessaly?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Not only that, my dear boy, but you may say further that I have never known of any one else who did, in my judgment.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Then you have never met Gorgias when he was at Athens?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I have.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  And did you not think that he knew?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I have not a good memory, Meno, and therefore I cannot now tell what I thought of him at the time.</div><div class="sentence"> And I dare say that he did know, and that you know what he said:  please, therefore, to remind me of what he said; or, if you would rather, tell me your own view; for I suspect that you and he think much alike.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then as he is not here, never mind him, and do you tell me:  By the gods, Meno, be generous, and tell me what you say that virtue is; for I shall be truly delighted to find that I have been mistaken, and that you and Gorgias do really have this knowledge; although I have been just saying that I have never found anybody who had.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  There will be no difficulty, Socrates, in answering your question.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us take first the virtue of a man—he should know how to administer the state, and in the administration of it to benefit his friends and harm his enemies; and he must also be careful not to suffer harm himself.</div><div class="sentence"> A woman's virtue, if you wish to know about that, may also be easily described:  her duty is to order her house, and keep what is indoors, and obey her husband.</div><div class="sentence"> Every age, every condition of life, young or old, male or female, bond or free, has a different virtue:  there are virtues numberless, and no lack of definitions of them; for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of each of us in all that we do.</div><div class="sentence"> And the same may be said of vice, Socrates (Compare Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Pol.</div><div class="sentence"> ).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How fortunate I am, Meno!</div><div class="sentence"> When I ask you for one virtue, you present me with a swarm of them (Compare Theaet.</div><div class="sentence"> ), which are in your keeping.</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose that I carry on the figure of the swarm, and ask of you, What is the nature of the bee?</div><div class="sentence"> and you answer that there are many kinds of bees, and I reply:  But do bees differ as bees, because there are many and different kinds of them; or are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality, as for example beauty, size, or shape?</div><div class="sentence"> How would you answer me?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  I should answer that bees do not differ from one another, as bees.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if I went on to say:  That is what I desire to know, Meno; tell me what is the quality in which they do not differ, but are all alike;—would you be able to answer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  I should.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And so of the virtues, however many and different they may be, they have all a common nature which makes them virtues; and on this he who would answer the question, 'What is virtue?'</div><div class="sentence"> would do well to have his eye fixed:  Do you understand?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  I am beginning to understand; but I do not as yet take hold of the question as I could wish.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  When you say, Meno, that there is one virtue of a man, another of a woman, another of a child, and so on, does this apply only to virtue, or would you say the same of health, and size, and strength?</div><div class="sentence"> Or is the nature of health always the same, whether in man or woman?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  I should say that health is the same, both in man and woman.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is not this true of size and strength?</div><div class="sentence"> If a woman is strong, she will be strong by reason of the same form and of the same strength subsisting in her which there is in the man.</div><div class="sentence"> I mean to say that strength, as strength, whether of man or woman, is the same.</div><div class="sentence"> Is there any difference?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  I think not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And will not virtue, as virtue, be the same, whether in a child or in a grown-up person, in a woman or in a man?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  I cannot help feeling, Socrates, that this case is different from the others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But why?</div><div class="sentence"> Were you not saying that the virtue of a man was to order a state, and the virtue of a woman was to order a house?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  I did say so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And can either house or state or anything be well ordered without temperance and without justice?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then they who order a state or a house temperately or justly order them with temperance and justice?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then both men and women, if they are to be good men and women, must have the same virtues of temperance and justice?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And can either a young man or an elder one be good, if they are intemperate and unjust?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  They cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  They must be temperate and just?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then all men are good in the same way, and by participation in the same virtues?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Such is the inference.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And they surely would not have been good in the same way, unless their virtue had been the same?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  They would not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">040</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then now that the sameness of all virtue has been proven, try and remember what you and Gorgias say that virtue is.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Will you have one definition of them all?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That is what I am seeking.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">043</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  If you want to have one definition of them all, I know not what to say, but that virtue is the power of governing mankind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">044</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And does this definition of virtue include all virtue?</div><div class="sentence"> Is virtue the same in a child and in a slave, Meno?</div><div class="sentence"> Can the child govern his father, or the slave his master; and would he who governed be any longer a slave?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  I think not, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">046</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  No, indeed; there would be small reason in that.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet once more, fair friend; according to you, virtue is 'the power of governing;' but do you not add 'justly and not unjustly'?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">047</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates; I agree there; for justice is virtue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">048</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Would you say 'virtue,' Meno, or 'a virtue'?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">049</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">050</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I mean as I might say about anything; that a round, for example, is 'a figure' and not simply 'figure,' and I should adopt this mode of speaking, because there are other figures.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Quite right; and that is just what I am saying about virtue—that there are other virtues as well as justice.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What are they?</div><div class="sentence"> tell me the names of them, as I would tell you the names of the other figures if you asked me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Courage and temperance and wisdom and magnanimity are virtues; and there are many others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Meno; and again we are in the same case:  in searching after one virtue we have found many, though not in the same way as before; but we have been unable to find the common virtue which runs through them all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Why, Socrates, even now I am not able to follow you in the attempt to get at one common notion of virtue as of other things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  No wonder; but I will try to get nearer if I can, for you know that all things have a common notion.</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose now that some one asked you the question which I asked before:  Meno, he would say, what is figure?</div><div class="sentence"> And if you answered 'roundness,' he would reply to you, in my way of speaking, by asking whether you would say that roundness is 'figure' or 'a figure;' and you would answer 'a figure.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And for this reason—that there are other figures?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if he proceeded to ask, What other figures are there?</div><div class="sentence"> you would have told him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  I should.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if he similarly asked what colour is, and you answered whiteness, and the questioner rejoined, Would you say that whiteness is colour or a colour?</div><div class="sentence"> you would reply, A colour, because there are other colours as well.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  I should.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">064</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if he had said, Tell me what they are?—you would have told him of other colours which are colours just as much as whiteness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">065</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And suppose that he were to pursue the matter in my way, he would say:  Ever and anon we are landed in particulars, but this is not what I want; tell me then, since you call them by a common name, and say that they are all figures, even when opposed to one another, what is that common nature which you designate as figure—which contains straight as well as round, and is no more one than the other—that would be your mode of speaking?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">067</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">068</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And in speaking thus, you do not mean to say that the round is round any more than straight, or the straight any more straight than round?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">069</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">070</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You only assert that the round figure is not more a figure than the straight, or the straight than the round?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">071</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">072</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  To what then do we give the name of figure?</div><div class="sentence"> Try and answer.</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose that when a person asked you this question either about figure or colour, you were to reply, Man, I do not understand what you want, or know what you are saying; he would look rather astonished and say:  Do you not understand that I am looking for the 'simile in multis'?</div><div class="sentence"> And then he might put the question in another form:  Meno, he might say, what is that 'simile in multis' which you call figure, and which includes not only round and straight figures, but all?</div><div class="sentence"> Could you not answer that question, Meno?</div><div class="sentence"> I wish that you would try; the attempt will be good practice with a view to the answer about virtue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">073</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  I would rather that you should answer, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">074</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Shall I indulge you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">075</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">076</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And then you will tell me about virtue?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">077</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  I will.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">078</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then I must do my best, for there is a prize to be won.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">079</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">080</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, I will try and explain to you what figure is.</div><div class="sentence"> What do you say to this answer?—Figure is the only thing which always follows colour.</div><div class="sentence"> Will you be satisfied with it, as I am sure that I should be, if you would let me have a similar definition of virtue?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">081</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  But, Socrates, it is such a simple answer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">082</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why simple?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">083</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Because, according to you, figure is that which always follows colour.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">084</span> <div class="sentence">  (SOCRATES: Granted.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">085</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  But if a person were to say that he does not know what colour is, any more than what figure is—what sort of answer would you have given him?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">086</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I should have told him the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> And if he were a philosopher of the eristic and antagonistic sort, I should say to him:  You have my answer, and if I am wrong, your business is to take up the argument and refute me.</div><div class="sentence"> But if we were friends, and were talking as you and I are now, I should reply in a milder strain and more in the dialectician's vein; that is to say, I should not only speak the truth, but I should make use of premises which the person interrogated would be willing to admit.</div><div class="sentence"> And this is the way in which I shall endeavour to approach you.</div><div class="sentence"> You will acknowledge, will you not, that there is such a thing as an end, or termination, or extremity?—all which words I use in the same sense, although I am aware that Prodicus might draw distinctions about them:  but still you, I am sure, would speak of a thing as ended or terminated—that is all which I am saying—not anything very difficult.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">087</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I should; and I believe that I understand your meaning.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">090</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well then, you are now in a condition to understand my definition of figure.</div><div class="sentence"> I define figure to be that in which the solid ends; or, more concisely, the limit of solid.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">091</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  And now, Socrates, what is colour?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">092</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You are outrageous, Meno, in thus plaguing a poor old man to give you an answer, when you will not take the trouble of remembering what is Gorgias' definition of virtue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">093</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  When you have told me what I ask, I will tell you, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  A man who was blindfolded has only to hear you talking, and he would know that you are a fair creature and have still many lovers.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Why do you think so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, because you always speak in imperatives:  like all beauties when they are in their prime, you are tyrannical; and also, as I suspect, you have found out that I have weakness for the fair, and therefore to humour you I must answer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Please do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">098</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Would you like me to answer you after the manner of Gorgias, which is familiar to you?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And passages into which and through which the effluences pass?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">103</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And some of the effluences fit into the passages, and some of them are too small or too large?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And there is such a thing as sight?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And now, as Pindar says, 'read my meaning: '—colour is an effluence of form, commensurate with sight, and palpable to sense.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">109</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  That, Socrates, appears to me to be an admirable answer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, yes, because it happens to be one which you have been in the habit of hearing:  and your wit will have discovered, I suspect, that you may explain in the same way the nature of sound and smell, and of many other similar phenomena.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">111</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">112</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The answer, Meno, was in the orthodox solemn vein, and therefore was more acceptable to you than the other answer about figure.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">113</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">114</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet, O son of Alexidemus, I cannot help thinking that the other was the better; and I am sure that you would be of the same opinion, if you would only stay and be initiated, and were not compelled, as you said yesterday, to go away before the mysteries.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">115</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  But I will stay, Socrates, if you will give me many such answers.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">116</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well then, for my own sake as well as for yours, I will do my very best; but I am afraid that I shall not be able to give you very many as good:  and now, in your turn, you are to fulfil your promise, and tell me what virtue is in the universal; and do not make a singular into a plural, as the facetious say of those who break a thing, but deliver virtue to me whole and sound, and not broken into a number of pieces:  I have given you the pattern.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">117</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Well then, Socrates, virtue, as I take it, is when he, who desires the honourable, is able to provide it for himself; so the poet says, and I say too—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">118</span> <div class="sentence">  'Virtue is the desire of things honourable and the power of attaining them.'</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">119</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And does he who desires the honourable also desire the good?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">120</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">121</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then are there some who desire the evil and others who desire the good?</div><div class="sentence"> Do not all men, my dear sir, desire good?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">122</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  I think not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">123</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There are some who desire evil?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">124</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">125</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do you mean that they think the evils which they desire, to be good; or do they know that they are evil and yet desire them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">126</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Both, I think.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">127</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do you really imagine, Meno, that a man knows evils to be evils and desires them notwithstanding?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">128</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly I do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">129</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And desire is of possession?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">130</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, of possession.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">131</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And does he think that the evils will do good to him who possesses them, or does he know that they will do him harm?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">132</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  There are some who think that the evils will do them good, and others who know that they will do them harm.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">133</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And, in your opinion, do those who think that they will do them good know that they are evils?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">134</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">135</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Is it not obvious that those who are ignorant of their nature do not desire them; but they desire what they suppose to be goods although they are really evils; and if they are mistaken and suppose the evils to be goods they really desire goods?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">136</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, in that case.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">137</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, and do those who, as you say, desire evils, and think that evils are hurtful to the possessor of them, know that they will be hurt by them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">138</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  They must know it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">139</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And must they not suppose that those who are hurt are miserable in proportion to the hurt which is inflicted upon them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">140</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  How can it be otherwise?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">141</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But are not the miserable ill-fated?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">142</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, indeed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">143</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And does any one desire to be miserable and ill-fated?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">144</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  I should say not, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">145</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if there is no one who desires to be miserable, there is no one, Meno, who desires evil; for what is misery but the desire and possession of evil?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">146</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  That appears to be the truth, Socrates, and I admit that nobody desires evil.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">147</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet, were you not saying just now that virtue is the desire and power of attaining good?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">148</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I did say so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">149</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if this be affirmed, then the desire of good is common to all, and one man is no better than another in that respect?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">150</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">151</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if one man is not better than another in desiring good, he must be better in the power of attaining it?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">152</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Exactly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">153</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, according to your definition, virtue would appear to be the power of attaining good?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">154</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  I entirely approve, Socrates, of the manner in which you now view this matter.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">155</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then let us see whether what you say is true from another point of view; for very likely you may be right: —You affirm virtue to be the power of attaining goods?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">156</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">157</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the goods which you mean are such as health and wealth and the possession of gold and silver, and having office and honour in the state—those are what you would call goods?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">158</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I should include all those.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">159</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, according to Meno, who is the hereditary friend of the great king, virtue is the power of getting silver and gold; and would you add that they must be gained piously, justly, or do you deem this to be of no consequence?</div><div class="sentence"> And is any mode of acquisition, even if unjust and dishonest, equally to be deemed virtue?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">160</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Not virtue, Socrates, but vice.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">161</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then justice or temperance or holiness, or some other part of virtue, as would appear, must accompany the acquisition, and without them the mere acquisition of good will not be virtue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">162</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Why, how can there be virtue without these?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">163</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the non-acquisition of gold and silver in a dishonest manner for oneself or another, or in other words the want of them, may be equally virtue?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">164</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">165</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then the acquisition of such goods is no more virtue than the non-acquisition and want of them, but whatever is accompanied by justice or honesty is virtue, and whatever is devoid of justice is vice.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">166</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  It cannot be otherwise, in my judgment.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">167</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And were we not saying just now that justice, temperance, and the like, were each of them a part of virtue?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">168</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">169</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And so, Meno, this is the way in which you mock me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">170</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Why do you say that, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">171</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, because I asked you to deliver virtue into my hands whole and unbroken, and I gave you a pattern according to which you were to frame your answer; and you have forgotten already, and tell me that virtue is the power of attaining good justly, or with justice; and justice you acknowledge to be a part of virtue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">172</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">173</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then it follows from your own admissions, that virtue is doing what you do with a part of virtue; for justice and the like are said by you to be parts of virtue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">174</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  What of that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">175</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What of that!</div><div class="sentence"> Why, did not I ask you to tell me the nature of virtue as a whole?</div><div class="sentence"> And you are very far from telling me this; but declare every action to be virtue which is done with a part of virtue; as though you had told me and I must already know the whole of virtue, and this too when frittered away into little pieces.</div><div class="sentence"> And, therefore, my dear Meno, I fear that I must begin again and repeat the same question:  What is virtue?</div><div class="sentence"> for otherwise, I can only say, that every action done with a part of virtue is virtue; what else is the meaning of saying that every action done with justice is virtue?</div><div class="sentence"> Ought I not to ask the question over again; for can any one who does not know virtue know a part of virtue?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">176</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  No; I do not say that he can.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">177</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do you remember how, in the example of figure, we rejected any answer given in terms which were as yet unexplained or unadmitted?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">178</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates; and we were quite right in doing so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">179</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But then, my friend, do not suppose that we can explain to any one the nature of virtue as a whole through some unexplained portion of virtue, or anything at all in that fashion; we should only have to ask over again the old question, What is virtue?</div><div class="sentence"> Am I not right?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">180</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  I believe that you are.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">181</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then begin again, and answer me, What, according to you and your friend Gorgias, is the definition of virtue?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">182</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  O Socrates, I used to be told, before I knew you, that you were always doubting yourself and making others doubt; and now you are casting your spells over me, and I am simply getting bewitched and enchanted, and am at my wits' end.</div><div class="sentence"> And if I may venture to make a jest upon you, you seem to me both in your appearance and in your power over others to be very like the flat torpedo fish, who torpifies those who come near him and touch him, as you have now torpified me, I think.</div><div class="sentence"> For my soul and my tongue are really torpid, and I do not know how to answer you; and though I have been delivered of an infinite variety of speeches about virtue before now, and to many persons—and very good ones they were, as I thought—at this moment I cannot even say what virtue is.</div><div class="sentence"> And I think that you are very wise in not voyaging and going away from home, for if you did in other places as you do in Athens, you would be cast into prison as a magician.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">183</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You are a rogue, Meno, and had all but caught me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">184</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">185</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I can tell why you made a simile about me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">186</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Why?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">187</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In order that I might make another simile about you.</div><div class="sentence"> For I know that all pretty young gentlemen like to have pretty similes made about them—as well they may—but I shall not return the compliment.</div><div class="sentence"> As to my being a torpedo, if the torpedo is torpid as well as the cause of torpidity in others, then indeed I am a torpedo, but not otherwise; for I perplex others, not because I am clear, but because I am utterly perplexed myself.</div><div class="sentence"> And now I know not what virtue is, and you seem to be in the same case, although you did once perhaps know before you touched me.</div><div class="sentence"> However, I have no objection to join with you in the enquiry.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">188</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  And how will you enquire, Socrates, into that which you do not know?</div><div class="sentence"> What will you put forth as the subject of enquiry?</div><div class="sentence"> And if you find what you want, how will you ever know that this is the thing which you did not know?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">189</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I know, Meno, what you mean; but just see what a tiresome dispute you are introducing.</div><div class="sentence"> You argue that a man cannot enquire either about that which he knows, or about that which he does not know; for if he knows, he has no need to enquire; and if not, he cannot; for he does not know the very subject about which he is to enquire (Compare Aristot.</div><div class="sentence"> Post.</div><div class="sentence"> Anal.</div><div class="sentence"> ).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">190</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Well, Socrates, and is not the argument sound?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">191</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I think not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">192</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Why not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">193</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I will tell you why:  I have heard from certain wise men and women who spoke of things divine that—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">194</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  What did they say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">195</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  They spoke of a glorious truth, as I conceive.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">196</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  What was it?</div><div class="sentence"> and who were they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">197</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Some of them were priests and priestesses, who had studied how they might be able to give a reason of their profession:  there have been poets also, who spoke of these things by inspiration, like Pindar, and many others who were inspired.</div><div class="sentence"> And they say—mark, now, and see whether their words are true—they say that the soul of man is immortal, and at one time has an end, which is termed dying, and at another time is born again, but is never destroyed.</div><div class="sentence"> And the moral is, that a man ought to live always in perfect holiness.</div><div class="sentence"> 'For in the ninth year Persephone sends the souls of those from whom she has received the penalty of ancient crime back again from beneath into the light of the sun above, and these are they who become noble kings and mighty men and great in wisdom and are called saintly heroes in after ages.'</div><div class="sentence"> The soul, then, as being immortal, and having been born again many times, and having seen all things that exist, whether in this world or in the world below, has knowledge of them all; and it is no wonder that she should be able to call to remembrance all that she ever knew about virtue, and about everything; for as all nature is akin, and the soul has learned all things; there is no difficulty in her eliciting or as men say learning, out of a single recollection all the rest, if a man is strenuous and does not faint; for all enquiry and all learning is but recollection.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore we ought not to listen to this sophistical argument about the impossibility of enquiry:  for it will make us idle; and is sweet only to the sluggard; but the other saying will make us active and inquisitive.</div><div class="sentence"> In that confiding, I will gladly enquire with you into the nature of virtue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">198</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates; but what do you mean by saying that we do not learn, and that what we call learning is only a process of recollection?</div><div class="sentence"> Can you teach me how this is?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">199</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I told you, Meno, just now that you were a rogue, and now you ask whether I can teach you, when I am saying that there is no teaching, but only recollection; and thus you imagine that you will involve me in a contradiction.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">200</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Indeed, Socrates, I protest that I had no such intention.</div><div class="sentence"> I only asked the question from habit; but if you can prove to me that what you say is true, I wish that you would.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">201</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  It will be no easy matter, but I will try to please you to the utmost of my power.</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose that you call one of your numerous attendants, that I may demonstrate on him.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">413</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I will try and tell you why, Meno.</div><div class="sentence"> I do not retract the assertion that if virtue is knowledge it may be taught; but I fear that I have some reason in doubting whether virtue is knowledge:  for consider now and say whether virtue, and not only virtue but anything that is taught, must not have teachers and disciples?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">414</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Surely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">415</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And conversely, may not the art of which neither teachers nor disciples exist be assumed to be incapable of being taught?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">417</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I have certainly often enquired whether there were any, and taken great pains to find them, and have never succeeded; and many have assisted me in the search, and they were the persons whom I thought the most likely to know.</div><div class="sentence"> Here at the moment when he is wanted we fortunately have sitting by us Anytus, the very person of whom we should make enquiry; to him then let us repair.</div><div class="sentence"> In the first place, he is the son of a wealthy and wise father, Anthemion, who acquired his wealth, not by accident or gift, like Ismenias the Theban (who has recently made himself as rich as Polycrates), but by his own skill and industry, and who is a well-conditioned, modest man, not insolent, or overbearing, or annoying; moreover, this son of his has received a good education, as the Athenian people certainly appear to think, for they choose him to fill the highest offices.</div><div class="sentence"> And these are the sort of men from whom you are likely to learn whether there are any teachers of virtue, and who they are.</div><div class="sentence"> Please, Anytus, to help me and your friend Meno in answering our question, Who are the teachers?</div><div class="sentence"> Consider the matter thus:  If we wanted Meno to be a good physician, to whom should we send him?</div><div class="sentence"> Should we not send him to the physicians?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">418</span><div class="speaker">ANYTUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">419</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Or if we wanted him to be a good cobbler, should we not send him to the cobblers?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">423</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let me trouble you with one more question.</div><div class="sentence"> When we say that we should be right in sending him to the physicians if we wanted him to be a physician, do we mean that we should be right in sending him to those who profess the art, rather than to those who do not, and to those who demand payment for teaching the art, and profess to teach it to any one who will come and learn?</div><div class="sentence"> And if these were our reasons, should we not be right in sending him?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">424</span><div class="speaker">ANYTUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">425</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And might not the same be said of flute-playing, and of the other arts?</div><div class="sentence"> Would a man who wanted to make another a flute-player refuse to send him to those who profess to teach the art for money, and be plaguing other persons to give him instruction, who are not professed teachers and who never had a single disciple in that branch of knowledge which he wishes him to acquire—would not such conduct be the height of folly?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">426</span><div class="speaker">ANYTUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, by Zeus, and of ignorance too.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">427</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good.</div><div class="sentence"> And now you are in a position to advise with me about my friend Meno.</div><div class="sentence"> He has been telling me, Anytus, that he desires to attain that kind of wisdom and virtue by which men order the state or the house, and honour their parents, and know when to receive and when to send away citizens and strangers, as a good man should.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, to whom should he go in order that he may learn this virtue?</div><div class="sentence"> Does not the previous argument imply clearly that we should send him to those who profess and avouch that they are the common teachers of all Hellas, and are ready to impart instruction to any one who likes, at a fixed price?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">428</span><div class="speaker">ANYTUS</div><div class="sentence">  Whom do you mean, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">429</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You surely know, do you not, Anytus, that these are the people whom mankind call Sophists?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">430</span><div class="speaker">ANYTUS</div><div class="sentence">  By Heracles, Socrates, forbear!</div><div class="sentence"> I only hope that no friend or kinsman or acquaintance of mine, whether citizen or stranger, will ever be so mad as to allow himself to be corrupted by them; for they are a manifest pest and corrupting influence to those who have to do with them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">431</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What, Anytus?</div><div class="sentence"> Of all the people who profess that they know how to do men good, do you mean to say that these are the only ones who not only do them no good, but positively corrupt those who are entrusted to them, and in return for this disservice have the face to demand money?</div><div class="sentence"> Indeed, I cannot believe you; for I know of a single man, Protagoras, who made more out of his craft than the illustrious Pheidias, who created such noble works, or any ten other statuaries.</div><div class="sentence"> How could that be?</div><div class="sentence"> A mender of old shoes, or patcher up of clothes, who made the shoes or clothes worse than he received them, could not have remained thirty days undetected, and would very soon have starved; whereas during more than forty years, Protagoras was corrupting all Hellas, and sending his disciples from him worse than he received them, and he was never found out.</div><div class="sentence"> For, if I am not mistaken, he was about seventy years old at his death, forty of which were spent in the practice of his profession; and during all that time he had a good reputation, which to this day he retains:  and not only Protagoras, but many others are well spoken of; some who lived before him, and others who are still living.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, when you say that they deceived and corrupted the youth, are they to be supposed to have corrupted them consciously or unconsciously?</div><div class="sentence"> Can those who were deemed by many to be the wisest men of Hellas have been out of their minds?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">432</span><div class="speaker">ANYTUS</div><div class="sentence">  Out of their minds!</div><div class="sentence"> No, Socrates; the young men who gave their money to them were out of their minds, and their relations and guardians who entrusted their youth to the care of these men were still more out of their minds, and most of all, the cities who allowed them to come in, and did not drive them out, citizen and stranger alike.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">433</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Has any of the Sophists wronged you, Anytus?</div><div class="sentence"> What makes you so angry with them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">434</span><div class="speaker">ANYTUS</div><div class="sentence">  No, indeed, neither I nor any of my belongings has ever had, nor would I suffer them to have, anything to do with them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">435</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then you are entirely unacquainted with them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">436</span><div class="speaker">ANYTUS</div><div class="sentence">  And I have no wish to be acquainted.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">437</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, my dear friend, how can you know whether a thing is good or bad of which you are wholly ignorant?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">438</span><div class="speaker">ANYTUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite well; I am sure that I know what manner of men these are, whether I am acquainted with them or not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">439</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You must be a diviner, Anytus, for I really cannot make out, judging from your own words, how, if you are not acquainted with them, you know about them.</div><div class="sentence"> But I am not enquiring of you who are the teachers who will corrupt Meno (let them be, if you please, the Sophists); I only ask you to tell him who there is in this great city who will teach him how to become eminent in the virtues which I was just now describing.</div><div class="sentence"> He is the friend of your family, and you will oblige him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">440</span><div class="speaker">ANYTUS</div><div class="sentence">  Why do you not tell him yourself?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">441</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I have told him whom I supposed to be the teachers of these things; but I learn from you that I am utterly at fault, and I dare say that you are right.</div><div class="sentence"> And now I wish that you, on your part, would tell me to whom among the Athenians he should go.</div><div class="sentence"> Whom would you name?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">442</span><div class="speaker">ANYTUS</div><div class="sentence">  Why single out individuals?</div><div class="sentence"> Any Athenian gentleman, taken at random, if he will mind him, will do far more good to him than the Sophists.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">443</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And did those gentlemen grow of themselves; and without having been taught by any one, were they nevertheless able to teach others that which they had never learned themselves?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">444</span><div class="speaker">ANYTUS</div><div class="sentence">  I imagine that they learned of the previous generation of gentlemen.</div><div class="sentence"> Have there not been many good men in this city?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">445</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, certainly, Anytus; and many good statesmen also there always have been and there are still, in the city of Athens.</div><div class="sentence"> But the question is whether they were also good teachers of their own virtue;—not whether there are, or have been, good men in this part of the world, but whether virtue can be taught, is the question which we have been discussing.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, do we mean to say that the good men of our own and of other times knew how to impart to others that virtue which they had themselves; or is virtue a thing incapable of being communicated or imparted by one man to another?</div><div class="sentence"> That is the question which I and Meno have been arguing.</div><div class="sentence"> Look at the matter in your own way:  Would you not admit that Themistocles was a good man?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">446</span><div class="speaker">ANYTUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly; no man better.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">447</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And must not he then have been a good teacher, if any man ever was a good teacher, of his own virtue?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">448</span><div class="speaker">ANYTUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes certainly,—if he wanted to be so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">449</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But would he not have wanted?</div><div class="sentence"> He would, at any rate, have desired to make his own son a good man and a gentleman; he could not have been jealous of him, or have intentionally abstained from imparting to him his own virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> Did you never hear that he made his son Cleophantus a famous horseman; and had him taught to stand upright on horseback and hurl a javelin, and to do many other marvellous things; and in anything which could be learned from a master he was well trained?</div><div class="sentence"> Have you not heard from our elders of him?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">450</span><div class="speaker">ANYTUS</div><div class="sentence">  I have.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">451</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then no one could say that his son showed any want of capacity?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">452</span><div class="speaker">ANYTUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very likely not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">453</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But did any one, old or young, ever say in your hearing that Cleophantus, son of Themistocles, was a wise or good man, as his father was?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">454</span><div class="speaker">ANYTUS</div><div class="sentence">  I have certainly never heard any one say so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">455</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if virtue could have been taught, would his father Themistocles have sought to train him in these minor accomplishments, and allowed him who, as you must remember, was his own son, to be no better than his neighbours in those qualities in which he himself excelled?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">456</span><div class="speaker">ANYTUS</div><div class="sentence">  Indeed, indeed, I think not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">457</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Here was a teacher of virtue whom you admit to be among the best men of the past.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us take another,—Aristides, the son of Lysimachus:  would you not acknowledge that he was a good man?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">487</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And is there anything else of which the professors are affirmed not only not to be teachers of others, but to be ignorant themselves, and bad at the knowledge of that which they are professing to teach?</div><div class="sentence"> or is there anything about which even the acknowledged 'gentlemen' are sometimes saying that 'this thing can be taught,' and sometimes the opposite?</div><div class="sentence"> Can you say that they are teachers in any true sense whose ideas are in such confusion?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">522</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Do tell me.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">525</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Because they require to be fastened in order to keep them, and if they are not fastened they will play truant and run away.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">527</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I mean to say that they are not very valuable possessions if they are at liberty, for they will walk off like runaway slaves; but when fastened, they are of great value, for they are really beautiful works of art.</div><div class="sentence"> Now this is an illustration of the nature of true opinions:  while they abide with us they are beautiful and fruitful, but they run away out of the human soul, and do not remain long, and therefore they are not of much value until they are fastened by the tie of the cause; and this fastening of them, friend Meno, is recollection, as you and I have agreed to call it.</div><div class="sentence"> But when they are bound, in the first place, they have the nature of knowledge; and, in the second place, they are abiding.</div><div class="sentence"> And this is why knowledge is more honourable and excellent than true opinion, because fastened by a chain.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">528</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  What you are saying, Socrates, seems to be very like the truth.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">530</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates; and you are quite right in saying so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">531</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And am I not also right in saying that true opinion leading the way perfects action quite as well as knowledge?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">533</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then right opinion is not a whit inferior to knowledge, or less useful in action; nor is the man who has right opinion inferior to him who has knowledge?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">535</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And surely the good man has been acknowledged by us to be useful?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">563</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And therefore not by any wisdom, and not because they were wise, did Themistocles and those others of whom Anytus spoke govern states.</div><div class="sentence"> This was the reason why they were unable to make others like themselves—because their virtue was not grounded on knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">564</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  That is probably true, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">565</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if not by knowledge, the only alternative which remains is that statesmen must have guided states by right opinion, which is in politics what divination is in religion; for diviners and also prophets say many things truly, but they know not what they say.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">574</span><div class="speaker">MENO</div><div class="sentence">  That is excellent, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">575</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, Meno, the conclusion is that virtue comes to the virtuous by the gift of God.</div><div class="sentence"> But we shall never know the certain truth until, before asking how virtue is given, we enquire into the actual nature of virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> I fear that I must go away, but do you, now that you are persuaded yourself, persuade our friend Anytus.</div><div class="sentence"> And do not let him be so exasperated; if you can conciliate him, you will have done good service to the Athenian people.</div></div>
