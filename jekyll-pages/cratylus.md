<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">001</span> <div class="sentence">  The Cratylus has always been a source of perplexity to the student of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> While in fancy and humour, and perfection of style and metaphysical originality, this dialogue may be ranked with the best of the Platonic writings, there has been an uncertainty about the motive of the piece, which interpreters have hitherto not succeeded in dispelling.</div><div class="sentence"> We need not suppose that Plato used words in order to conceal his thoughts, or that he would have been unintelligible to an educated contemporary.</div><div class="sentence"> In the Phaedrus and Euthydemus we also find a difficulty in determining the precise aim of the author.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato wrote satires in the form of dialogues, and his meaning, like that of other satirical writers, has often slept in the ear of posterity.</div><div class="sentence"> Two causes may be assigned for this obscurity: 1st, the subtlety and allusiveness of this species of composition; 2nd, the difficulty of reproducing a state of life and literature which has passed away.</div><div class="sentence"> A satire is unmeaning unless we can place ourselves back among the persons and thoughts of the age in which it was written.</div><div class="sentence"> Had the treatise of Antisthenes upon words, or the speculations of Cratylus, or some other Heracleitean of the fourth century B.C., on the nature of language been preserved to us; or if we had lived at the time, and been “rich enough to attend the fifty-drachma course of Prodicus,” we should have understood Plato better, and many points which are now attributed to the extravagance of Socrates’ humour would have been found, like the allusions of Aristophanes in the Clouds, to have gone home to the sophists and grammarians of the day.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">002</span> <div class="sentence">  For the age was very busy with philological speculation; and many questions were beginning to be asked about language which were parallel to other questions about justice, virtue, knowledge, and were illustrated in a similar manner by the analogy of the arts.</div><div class="sentence"> Was there a correctness in words, and were they given by nature or convention?</div><div class="sentence"> In the presocratic philosophy mankind had been striving to attain an expression of their ideas, and now they were beginning to ask themselves whether the expression might not be distinguished from the idea?</div><div class="sentence"> They were also seeking to distinguish the parts of speech and to enquire into the relation of subject and predicate.</div><div class="sentence"> Grammar and logic were moving about somewhere in the depths of the human soul, but they were not yet awakened into consciousness and had not found names for themselves, or terms by which they might be expressed.</div><div class="sentence"> Of these beginnings of the study of language we know little, and there necessarily arises an obscurity when the surroundings of such a work as the Cratylus are taken away.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover, in this, as in most of the dialogues of Plato, allowance has to be made for the character of Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> For the theory of language can only be propounded by him in a manner which is consistent with his own profession of ignorance.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence his ridicule of the new school of etymology is interspersed with many declarations “that he knows nothing,” “that he has learned from Euthyphro,” and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> Even the truest things which he says are depreciated by himself.</div><div class="sentence"> He professes to be guessing, but the guesses of Plato are better than all the other theories of the ancients respecting language put together.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">003</span> <div class="sentence">  The dialogue hardly derives any light from Plato’s other writings, and still less from Scholiasts and Neoplatonist writers.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates must be interpreted from himself, and on first reading we certainly have a difficulty in understanding his drift, or his relation to the two other interlocutors in the dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> Does he agree with Cratylus or with Hermogenes, and is he serious in those fanciful etymologies, extending over more than half the dialogue, which he seems so greatly to relish?</div><div class="sentence"> Or is he serious in part only; and can we separate his jest from his earnest?—Sunt bona, sunt quaedum mediocria, sunt mala plura.</div><div class="sentence"> Most of them are ridiculously bad, and yet among them are found, as if by accident, principles of philology which are unsurpassed in any ancient writer, and even in advance of any philologer of the last century.</div><div class="sentence"> May we suppose that Plato, like Lucian, has been amusing his fancy by writing a comedy in the form of a prose dialogue?</div><div class="sentence"> And what is the final result of the enquiry?</div><div class="sentence"> Is Plato an upholder of the conventional theory of language, which he acknowledges to be imperfect?</div><div class="sentence"> or does he mean to imply that a perfect language can only be based on his own theory of ideas?</div><div class="sentence"> Or if this latter explanation is refuted by his silence, then in what relation does his account of language stand to the rest of his philosophy?</div><div class="sentence"> Or may we be so bold as to deny the connexion between them?</div><div class="sentence"> (For the allusion to the ideas at the end of the dialogue is merely intended to show that we must not put words in the place of things or realities, which is a thesis strongly insisted on by Plato in many other passages)...These are some of the first thoughts which arise in the mind of the reader of the Cratylus.</div><div class="sentence"> And the consideration of them may form a convenient introduction to the general subject of the dialogue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">004</span> <div class="sentence">  We must not expect all the parts of a dialogue of Plato to tend equally to some clearly-defined end.</div><div class="sentence"> His idea of literary art is not the absolute proportion of the whole, such as we appear to find in a Greek temple or statue; nor should his works be tried by any such standard.</div><div class="sentence"> They have often the beauty of poetry, but they have also the freedom of conversation.</div><div class="sentence"> “Words are more plastic than wax” (Rep.), and may be moulded into any form.</div><div class="sentence"> He wanders on from one topic to another, careless of the unity of his work, not fearing any “judge, or spectator, who may recall him to the point” (Theat.</div><div class="sentence"> ), “whither the argument blows we follow” (Rep.).</div><div class="sentence"> To have determined beforehand, as in a modern didactic treatise, the nature and limits of the subject, would have been fatal to the spirit of enquiry or discovery, which is the soul of the dialogue...These remarks are applicable to nearly all the works of Plato, but to the Cratylus and Phaedrus more than any others.</div><div class="sentence"> See Phaedrus, Introduction.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span> <div class="sentence">  There is another aspect under which some of the dialogues of Plato may be more truly viewed:—they are dramatic sketches of an argument.</div><div class="sentence"> We have found that in the Lysis, Charmides, Laches, Protagoras, Meno, we arrived at no conclusion—the different sides of the argument were personified in the different speakers; but the victory was not distinctly attributed to any of them, nor the truth wholly the property of any.</div><div class="sentence"> And in the Cratylus we have no reason to assume that Socrates is either wholly right or wholly wrong, or that Plato, though he evidently inclines to him, had any other aim than that of personifying, in the characters of Hermogenes, Socrates, and Cratylus, the three theories of language which are respectively maintained by them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span> <div class="sentence">  The two subordinate persons of the dialogue, Hermogenes and Cratylus, are at the opposite poles of the argument.</div><div class="sentence"> But after a while the disciple of the Sophist and the follower of Heracleitus are found to be not so far removed from one another as at first sight appeared; and both show an inclination to accept the third view which Socrates interposes between them.</div><div class="sentence"> First, Hermogenes, the poor brother of the rich Callias, expounds the doctrine that names are conventional; like the names of slaves, they may be given and altered at pleasure.</div><div class="sentence"> This is one of those principles which, whether applied to society or language, explains everything and nothing.</div><div class="sentence"> For in all things there is an element of convention; but the admission of this does not help us to understand the rational ground or basis in human nature on which the convention proceeds.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates first of all intimates to Hermogenes that his view of language is only a part of a sophistical whole, and ultimately tends to abolish the distinction between truth and falsehood.</div><div class="sentence"> Hermogenes is very ready to throw aside the sophistical tenet, and listens with a sort of half admiration, half belief, to the speculations of Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span> <div class="sentence">  Cratylus is of opinion that a name is either a true name or not a name at all.</div><div class="sentence"> He is unable to conceive of degrees of imitation; a word is either the perfect expression of a thing, or a mere inarticulate sound (a fallacy which is still prevalent among theorizers about the origin of language).</div><div class="sentence"> He is at once a philosopher and a sophist; for while wanting to rest language on an immutable basis, he would deny the possibility of falsehood.</div><div class="sentence"> He is inclined to derive all truth from language, and in language he sees reflected the philosophy of Heracleitus.</div><div class="sentence"> His views are not like those of Hermogenes, hastily taken up, but are said to be the result of mature consideration, although he is described as still a young man.</div><div class="sentence"> With a tenacity characteristic of the Heracleitean philosophers, he clings to the doctrine of the flux.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Theaet.)</div><div class="sentence"> Of the real Cratylus we know nothing, except that he is recorded by Aristotle to have been the friend or teacher of Plato; nor have we any proof that he resembled the likeness of him in Plato any more than the Critias of Plato is like the real Critias, or the Euthyphro in this dialogue like the other Euthyphro, the diviner, in the dialogue which is called after him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">008</span> <div class="sentence">  Between these two extremes, which have both of them a sophistical character, the view of Socrates is introduced, which is in a manner the union of the two.</div><div class="sentence"> Language is conventional and also natural, and the true conventional-natural is the rational.</div><div class="sentence"> It is a work not of chance, but of art; the dialectician is the artificer of words, and the legislator gives authority to them.</div><div class="sentence"> They are the expressions or imitations in sound of things.</div><div class="sentence"> In a sense, Cratylus is right in saying that things have by nature names; for nature is not opposed either to art or to law.</div><div class="sentence"> But vocal imitation, like any other copy, may be imperfectly executed; and in this way an element of chance or convention enters in.</div><div class="sentence"> There is much which is accidental or exceptional in language.</div><div class="sentence"> Some words have had their original meaning so obscured, that they require to be helped out by convention.</div><div class="sentence"> But still the true name is that which has a natural meaning.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus nature, art, chance, all combine in the formation of language.</div><div class="sentence"> And the three views respectively propounded by Hermogenes, Socrates, Cratylus, may be described as the conventional, the artificial or rational, and the natural.</div><div class="sentence"> The view of Socrates is the meeting-point of the other two, just as conceptualism is the meeting-point of nominalism and realism.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">009</span> <div class="sentence">  We can hardly say that Plato was aware of the truth, that “languages are not made, but grow.” But still, when he says that “the legislator made language with the dialectician standing on his right hand,” we need not infer from this that he conceived words, like coins, to be issued from the mint of the State.</div><div class="sentence"> The creator of laws and of social life is naturally regarded as the creator of language, according to Hellenic notions, and the philosopher is his natural advisor.</div><div class="sentence"> We are not to suppose that the legislator is performing any extraordinary function; he is merely the Eponymus of the State, who prescribes rules for the dialectician and for all other artists.</div><div class="sentence"> According to a truly Platonic mode of approaching the subject, language, like virtue in the Republic, is examined by the analogy of the arts.</div><div class="sentence"> Words are works of art which may be equally made in different materials, and are well made when they have a meaning.</div><div class="sentence"> Of the process which he thus describes, Plato had probably no very definite notion.</div><div class="sentence"> But he means to express generally that language is the product of intelligence, and that languages belong to States and not to individuals.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">010</span> <div class="sentence">  A better conception of language could not have been formed in Plato’s age, than that which he attributes to Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet many persons have thought that the mind of Plato is more truly seen in the vague realism of Cratylus.</div><div class="sentence"> This misconception has probably arisen from two causes: first, the desire to bring Plato’s theory of language into accordance with the received doctrine of the Platonic ideas; secondly, the impression created by Socrates himself, that he is not in earnest, and is only indulging the fancy of the hour.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">011</span> <div class="sentence">  1.</div><div class="sentence"> We shall have occasion to show more at length, in the Introduction to future dialogues, that the so-called Platonic ideas are only a semi-mythical form, in which he attempts to realize abstractions, and that they are replaced in his later writings by a rational theory of psychology.</div><div class="sentence"> (See introductions to the Meno and the Sophist.)</div><div class="sentence"> And in the Cratylus he gives a general account of the nature and origin of language, in which Adam Smith, Rousseau, and other writers of the last century, would have substantially agreed.</div><div class="sentence"> At the end of the dialogue, he speaks as in the Symposium and Republic of absolute beauty and good; but he never supposed that they were capable of being embodied in words.</div><div class="sentence"> Of the names of the ideas, he would have said, as he says of the names of the Gods, that we know nothing.</div><div class="sentence"> Even the realism of Cratylus is not based upon the ideas of Plato, but upon the flux of Heracleitus.</div><div class="sentence"> Here, as in the Sophist and Politicus, Plato expressly draws attention to the want of agreement in words and things.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence we are led to infer, that the view of Socrates is not the less Plato’s own, because not based upon the ideas; 2nd, that Plato’s theory of language is not inconsistent with the rest of his philosophy.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">012</span> <div class="sentence">  2.</div><div class="sentence"> We do not deny that Socrates is partly in jest and partly in earnest.</div><div class="sentence"> He is discoursing in a high-flown vein, which may be compared to the “dithyrambics of the Phaedrus.” They are mysteries of which he is speaking, and he professes a kind of ludicrous fear of his imaginary wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> When he is arguing out of Homer, about the names of Hector’s son, or when he describes himself as inspired or maddened by Euthyphro, with whom he has been sitting from the early dawn (compare Phaedrus and Lysias; Phaedr.)</div><div class="sentence"> and expresses his intention of yielding to the illusion to-day, and to-morrow he will go to a priest and be purified, we easily see that his words are not to be taken seriously.</div><div class="sentence"> In this part of the dialogue his dread of committing impiety, the pretended derivation of his wisdom from another, the extravagance of some of his etymologies, and, in general, the manner in which the fun, fast and furious, vires acquirit eundo, remind us strongly of the Phaedrus.</div><div class="sentence"> The jest is a long one, extending over more than half the dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> But then, we remember that the Euthydemus is a still longer jest, in which the irony is preserved to the very end.</div><div class="sentence"> There he is parodying the ingenious follies of early logic; in the Cratylus he is ridiculing the fancies of a new school of sophists and grammarians.</div><div class="sentence"> The fallacies of the Euthydemus are still retained at the end of our logic books; and the etymologies of the Cratylus have also found their way into later writers.</div><div class="sentence"> Some of these are not much worse than the conjectures of Hemsterhuis, and other critics of the last century; but this does not prove that they are serious.</div><div class="sentence"> For Plato is in advance of his age in his conception of language, as much as he is in his conception of mythology.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Phaedrus.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">013</span> <div class="sentence">  When the fervour of his etymological enthusiasm has abated, Socrates ends, as he has begun, with a rational explanation of language.</div><div class="sentence"> Still he preserves his “know nothing” disguise, and himself declares his first notions about names to be reckless and ridiculous.</div><div class="sentence"> Having explained compound words by resolving them into their original elements, he now proceeds to analyse simple words into the letters of which they are composed.</div><div class="sentence"> The Socrates who “knows nothing,” here passes into the teacher, the dialectician, the arranger of species.</div><div class="sentence"> There is nothing in this part of the dialogue which is either weak or extravagant.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato is a supporter of the Onomatopoetic theory of language; that is to say, he supposes words to be formed by the imitation of ideas in sounds; he also recognises the effect of time, the influence of foreign languages, the desire of euphony, to be formative principles; and he admits a certain element of chance.</div><div class="sentence"> But he gives no imitation in all this that he is preparing the way for the construction of an ideal language.</div><div class="sentence"> Or that he has any Eleatic speculation to oppose to the Heracleiteanism of Cratylus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">014</span> <div class="sentence">  The theory of language which is propounded in the Cratylus is in accordance with the later phase of the philosophy of Plato, and would have been regarded by him as in the main true.</div><div class="sentence"> The dialogue is also a satire on the philological fancies of the day.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates in pursuit of his vocation as a detector of false knowledge, lights by accident on the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> He is guessing, he is dreaming; he has heard, as he says in the Phaedrus, from another: no one is more surprised than himself at his own discoveries.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet some of his best remarks, as for example his view of the derivation of Greek words from other languages, or of the permutations of letters, or again, his observation that in speaking of the Gods we are only speaking of our names of them, occur among these flights of humour.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">015</span> <div class="sentence">  We can imagine a character having a profound insight into the nature of men and things, and yet hardly dwelling upon them seriously; blending inextricably sense and nonsense; sometimes enveloping in a blaze of jests the most serious matters, and then again allowing the truth to peer through; enjoying the flow of his own humour, and puzzling mankind by an ironical exaggeration of their absurdities.</div><div class="sentence"> Such were Aristophanes and Rabelais; such, in a different style, were Sterne, Jean Paul, Hamann,—writers who sometimes become unintelligible through the extravagance of their fancies.</div><div class="sentence"> Such is the character which Plato intends to depict in some of his dialogues as the Silenus Socrates; and through this medium we have to receive our theory of language.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">016</span> <div class="sentence">  There remains a difficulty which seems to demand a more exact answer: In what relation does the satirical or etymological portion of the dialogue stand to the serious?</div><div class="sentence"> Granting all that can be said about the provoking irony of Socrates, about the parody of Euthyphro, or Prodicus, or Antisthenes, how does the long catalogue of etymologies furnish any answer to the question of Hermogenes, which is evidently the main thesis of the dialogue: What is the truth, or correctness, or principle of names?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">017</span> <div class="sentence">  After illustrating the nature of correctness by the analogy of the arts, and then, as in the Republic, ironically appealing to the authority of the Homeric poems, Socrates shows that the truth or correctness of names can only be ascertained by an appeal to etymology.</div><div class="sentence"> The truth of names is to be found in the analysis of their elements.</div><div class="sentence"> But why does he admit etymologies which are absurd, based on Heracleitean fancies, fourfold interpretations of words, impossible unions and separations of syllables and letters?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">018</span> <div class="sentence">  1.</div><div class="sentence"> The answer to this difficulty has been already anticipated in part: Socrates is not a dogmatic teacher, and therefore he puts on this wild and fanciful disguise, in order that the truth may be permitted to appear: 2. as Benfey remarks, an erroneous example may illustrate a principle of language as well as a true one: 3. many of these etymologies, as, for example, that of dikaion, are indicated, by the manner in which Socrates speaks of them, to have been current in his own age: 4. the philosophy of language had not made such progress as would have justified Plato in propounding real derivations.</div><div class="sentence"> Like his master Socrates, he saw through the hollowness of the incipient sciences of the day, and tries to move in a circle apart from them, laying down the conditions under which they are to be pursued, but, as in the Timaeus, cautious and tentative, when he is speaking of actual phenomena.</div><div class="sentence"> To have made etymologies seriously, would have seemed to him like the interpretation of the myths in the Phaedrus, the task “of a not very fortunate individual, who had a great deal of time on his hands.” The irony of Socrates places him above and beyond the errors of his contemporaries.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">019</span> <div class="sentence">  The Cratylus is full of humour and satirical touches: the inspiration which comes from Euthyphro, and his prancing steeds, the light admixture of quotations from Homer, and the spurious dialectic which is applied to them; the jest about the fifty-drachma course of Prodicus, which is declared on the best authority, viz.</div><div class="sentence"> his own, to be a complete education in grammar and rhetoric; the double explanation of the name Hermogenes, either as “not being in luck,” or “being no speaker;” the dearly-bought wisdom of Callias, the Lacedaemonian whose name was “Rush,” and, above all, the pleasure which Socrates expresses in his own dangerous discoveries, which “to-morrow he will purge away,” are truly humorous.</div><div class="sentence"> While delivering a lecture on the philosophy of language, Socrates is also satirizing the endless fertility of the human mind in spinning arguments out of nothing, and employing the most trifling and fanciful analogies in support of a theory.</div><div class="sentence"> Etymology in ancient as in modern times was a favourite recreation; and Socrates makes merry at the expense of the etymologists.</div><div class="sentence"> The simplicity of Hermogenes, who is ready to believe anything that he is told, heightens the effect.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates in his genial and ironical mood hits right and left at his adversaries: Ouranos is so called apo tou oran ta ano, which, as some philosophers say, is the way to have a pure mind; the sophists are by a fanciful explanation converted into heroes; “the givers of names were like some philosophers who fancy that the earth goes round because their heads are always going round.” There is a great deal of “mischief” lurking in the following: “I found myself in greater perplexity about justice than I was before I began to learn;” “The rho in katoptron must be the addition of some one who cares nothing about truth, but thinks only of putting the mouth into shape;” “Tales and falsehoods have generally to do with the Tragic and goatish life, and tragedy is the place of them.” Several philosophers and sophists are mentioned by name: first, Protagoras and Euthydemus are assailed; then the interpreters of Homer, oi palaioi Omerikoi (compare Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Met.)</div><div class="sentence"> and the Orphic poets are alluded to by the way; then he discovers a hive of wisdom in the philosophy of Heracleitus;—the doctrine of the flux is contained in the word ousia (= osia the pushing principle), an anticipation of Anaxagoras is found in psuche and selene.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, he ridicules the arbitrary methods of pulling out and putting in letters which were in vogue among the philologers of his time; or slightly scoffs at contemporary religious beliefs.</div><div class="sentence"> Lastly, he is impatient of hearing from the half-converted Cratylus the doctrine that falsehood can neither be spoken, nor uttered, nor addressed; a piece of sophistry attributed to Gorgias, which reappears in the Sophist.</div><div class="sentence"> And he proceeds to demolish, with no less delight than he had set up, the Heracleitean theory of language.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">020</span> <div class="sentence">  In the latter part of the dialogue Socrates becomes more serious, though he does not lay aside but rather aggravates his banter of the Heracleiteans, whom here, as in the Theaetetus, he delights to ridicule.</div><div class="sentence"> What was the origin of this enmity we can hardly determine:—was it due to the natural dislike which may be supposed to exist between the “patrons of the flux” and the “friends of the ideas” (Soph.)?</div><div class="sentence"> or is it to be attributed to the indignation which Plato felt at having wasted his time upon “Cratylus and the doctrines of Heracleitus” in the days of his youth?</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates, touching on some of the characteristic difficulties of early Greek philosophy, endeavours to show Cratylus that imitation may be partial or imperfect, that a knowledge of things is higher than a knowledge of names, and that there can be no knowledge if all things are in a state of transition.</div><div class="sentence"> But Cratylus, who does not easily apprehend the argument from common sense, remains unconvinced, and on the whole inclines to his former opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> Some profound philosophical remarks are scattered up and down, admitting of an application not only to language but to knowledge generally; such as the assertion that “consistency is no test of truth:” or again, “If we are over-precise about words, truth will say ‘too late’ to us as to the belated traveller in Aegina.”</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">021</span> <div class="sentence">  The place of the dialogue in the series cannot be determined with certainty.</div><div class="sentence"> The style and subject, and the treatment of the character of Socrates, have a close resemblance to the earlier dialogues, especially to the Phaedrus and Euthydemus.</div><div class="sentence"> The manner in which the ideas are spoken of at the end of the dialogue, also indicates a comparatively early date.</div><div class="sentence"> The imaginative element is still in full vigour; the Socrates of the Cratylus is the Socrates of the Apology and Symposium, not yet Platonized; and he describes, as in the Theaetetus, the philosophy of Heracleitus by “unsavoury” similes—he cannot believe that the world is like “a leaky vessel,” or “a man who has a running at the nose”; he attributes the flux of the world to the swimming in some folks’ heads.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, the relation of thought to language is omitted here, but is treated of in the Sophist.</div><div class="sentence"> These grounds are not sufficient to enable us to arrive at a precise conclusion.</div><div class="sentence"> But we shall not be far wrong in placing the Cratylus about the middle, or at any rate in the first half, of the series.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">022</span> <div class="sentence">  Cratylus, the Heracleitean philosopher, and Hermogenes, the brother of Callias, have been arguing about names; the former maintaining that they are natural, the latter that they are conventional.</div><div class="sentence"> Cratylus affirms that his own is a true name, but will not allow that the name of Hermogenes is equally true.</div><div class="sentence"> Hermogenes asks Socrates to explain to him what Cratylus means; or, far rather, he would like to know, What Socrates himself thinks about the truth or correctness of names?</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates replies, that hard is knowledge, and the nature of names is a considerable part of knowledge: he has never been to hear the fifty-drachma course of Prodicus; and having only attended the single-drachma course, he is not competent to give an opinion on such matters.</div><div class="sentence"> When Cratylus denies that Hermogenes is a true name, he supposes him to mean that he is not a true son of Hermes, because he is never in luck.</div><div class="sentence"> But he would like to have an open council and to hear both sides.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">023</span> <div class="sentence">  Hermogenes is of opinion that there is no principle in names; they may be changed, as we change the names of slaves, whenever we please, and the altered name is as good as the original one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">024</span> <div class="sentence">  You mean to say, for instance, rejoins Socrates, that if I agree to call a man a horse, then a man will be rightly called a horse by me, and a man by the rest of the world?</div><div class="sentence"> But, surely, there is in words a true and a false, as there are true and false propositions.</div><div class="sentence"> If a whole proposition be true or false, then the parts of a proposition may be true or false, and the least parts as well as the greatest; and the least parts are names, and therefore names may be true or false.</div><div class="sentence"> Would Hermogenes maintain that anybody may give a name to anything, and as many names as he pleases; and would all these names be always true at the time of giving them?</div><div class="sentence"> Hermogenes replies that this is the only way in which he can conceive that names are correct; and he appeals to the practice of different nations, and of the different Hellenic tribes, in confirmation of his view.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates asks, whether the things differ as the words which represent them differ:—Are we to maintain with Protagoras, that what appears is?</div><div class="sentence"> Hermogenes has always been puzzled about this, but acknowledges, when he is pressed by Socrates, that there are a few very good men in the world, and a great many very bad; and the very good are the wise, and the very bad are the foolish; and this is not mere appearance but reality.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor is he disposed to say with Euthydemus, that all things equally and always belong to all men; in that case, again, there would be no distinction between bad and good men.</div><div class="sentence"> But then, the only remaining possibility is, that all things have their several distinct natures, and are independent of our notions about them.</div><div class="sentence"> And not only things, but actions, have distinct natures, and are done by different processes.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a natural way of cutting or burning, and a natural instrument with which men cut or burn, and any other way will fail;—this is true of all actions.</div><div class="sentence"> And speaking is a kind of action, and naming is a kind of speaking, and we must name according to a natural process, and with a proper instrument.</div><div class="sentence"> We cut with a knife, we pierce with an awl, we weave with a shuttle, we name with a name.</div><div class="sentence"> And as a shuttle separates the warp from the woof, so a name distinguishes the natures of things.</div><div class="sentence"> The weaver will use the shuttle well,—that is, like a weaver; and the teacher will use the name well,—that is, like a teacher.</div><div class="sentence"> The shuttle will be made by the carpenter; the awl by the smith or skilled person.</div><div class="sentence"> But who makes a name?</div><div class="sentence"> Does not the law give names, and does not the teacher receive them from the legislator?</div><div class="sentence"> He is the skilled person who makes them, and of all skilled workmen he is the rarest.</div><div class="sentence"> But how does the carpenter make or repair the shuttle, and to what will he look?</div><div class="sentence"> Will he not look at the ideal which he has in his mind?</div><div class="sentence"> And as the different kinds of work differ, so ought the instruments which make them to differ.</div><div class="sentence"> The several kinds of shuttles ought to answer in material and form to the several kinds of webs.</div><div class="sentence"> And the legislator ought to know the different materials and forms of which names are made in Hellas and other countries.</div><div class="sentence"> But who is to be the judge of the proper form?</div><div class="sentence"> The judge of shuttles is the weaver who uses them; the judge of lyres is the player of the lyre; the judge of ships is the pilot.</div><div class="sentence"> And will not the judge who is able to direct the legislator in his work of naming, be he who knows how to use the names—he who can ask and answer questions—in short, the dialectician?</div><div class="sentence"> The pilot directs the carpenter how to make the rudder, and the dialectician directs the legislator how he is to impose names; for to express the ideal forms of things in syllables and letters is not the easy task, Hermogenes, which you imagine.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">025</span> <div class="sentence">  “I should be more readily persuaded, if you would show me this natural correctness of names.”</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">026</span> <div class="sentence">  Indeed I cannot; but I see that you have advanced; for you now admit that there is a correctness of names, and that not every one can give a name.</div><div class="sentence"> But what is the nature of this correctness or truth, you must learn from the Sophists, of whom your brother Callias has bought his reputation for wisdom rather dearly; and since they require to be paid, you, having no money, had better learn from him at second-hand.</div><div class="sentence"> “Well, but I have just given up Protagoras, and I should be inconsistent in going to learn of him.” Then if you reject him you may learn of the poets, and in particular of Homer, who distinguishes the names given by Gods and men to the same things, as in the verse about the river God who fought with Hephaestus, “whom the Gods call Xanthus, and men call Scamander;” or in the lines in which he mentions the bird which the Gods call “Chalcis,” and men “Cymindis;” or the hill which men call “Batieia,” and the Gods “Myrinna’s Tomb.” Here is an important lesson; for the Gods must of course be right in their use of names.</div><div class="sentence"> And this is not the only truth about philology which may be learnt from Homer.</div><div class="sentence"> Does he not say that Hector’s son had two names—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">027</span> <div class="sentence">  “Hector called him Scamandrius, but the others Astyanax”?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">028</span> <div class="sentence">  Now, if the men called him Astyanax, is it not probable that the other name was conferred by the women?</div><div class="sentence"> And which are more likely to be right—the wiser or the less wise, the men or the women?</div><div class="sentence"> Homer evidently agreed with the men: and of the name given by them he offers an explanation;—the boy was called Astyanax (“king of the city”), because his father saved the city.</div><div class="sentence"> The names Astyanax and Hector, moreover, are really the same,—the one means a king, and the other is “a holder or possessor.” For as the lion’s whelp may be called a lion, or the horse’s foal a foal, so the son of a king may be called a king.</div><div class="sentence"> But if the horse had produced a calf, then that would be called a calf.</div><div class="sentence"> Whether the syllables of a name are the same or not makes no difference, provided the meaning is retained.</div><div class="sentence"> For example; the names of letters, whether vowels or consonants, do not correspond to their sounds, with the exception of epsilon, upsilon, omicron, omega.</div><div class="sentence"> The name Beta has three letters added to the sound—and yet this does not alter the sense of the word, or prevent the whole name having the value which the legislator intended.</div><div class="sentence"> And the same may be said of a king and the son of a king, who like other animals resemble each other in the course of nature; the words by which they are signified may be disguised, and yet amid differences of sound the etymologist may recognise the same notion, just as the physician recognises the power of the same drugs under different disguises of colour and smell.</div><div class="sentence"> Hector and Astyanax have only one letter alike, but they have the same meaning; and Agis (leader) is altogether different in sound from Polemarchus (chief in war), or Eupolemus (good warrior); but the two words present the same idea of leader or general, like the words Iatrocles and Acesimbrotus, which equally denote a physician.</div><div class="sentence"> The son succeeds the father as the foal succeeds the horse, but when, out of the course of nature, a prodigy occurs, and the offspring no longer resembles the parent, then the names no longer agree.</div><div class="sentence"> This may be illustrated by the case of Agamemnon and his son Orestes, of whom the former has a name significant of his patience at the siege of Troy; while the name of the latter indicates his savage, man-of-the-mountain nature.</div><div class="sentence"> Atreus again, for his murder of Chrysippus, and his cruelty to Thyestes, is rightly named Atreus, which, to the eye of the etymologist, is ateros (destructive), ateires (stubborn), atreotos (fearless); and Pelops is o ta pelas oron (he who sees what is near only), because in his eagerness to win Hippodamia, he was unconscious of the remoter consequences which the murder of Myrtilus would entail upon his race.</div><div class="sentence"> The name Tantalus, if slightly changed, offers two etymologies; either apo tes tou lithou talanteias, or apo tou talantaton einai, signifying at once the hanging of the stone over his head in the world below, and the misery which he brought upon his country.</div><div class="sentence"> And the name of his father, Zeus, Dios, Zenos, has an excellent meaning, though hard to be understood, because really a sentence which is divided into two parts (Zeus, Dios).</div><div class="sentence"> For he, being the lord and king of all, is the author of our being, and in him all live: this is implied in the double form, Dios, Zenos, which being put together and interpreted is di on ze panta.</div><div class="sentence"> There may, at first sight, appear to be some irreverence in calling him the son of Cronos, who is a proverb for stupidity; but the meaning is that Zeus himself is the son of a mighty intellect; Kronos, quasi koros, not in the sense of a youth, but quasi to katharon kai akeraton tou nou—the pure and garnished mind, which in turn is begotten of Uranus, who is so called apo tou oran ta ano, from looking upwards; which, as philosophers say, is the way to have a pure mind.</div><div class="sentence"> The earlier portion of Hesiod’s genealogy has escaped my memory, or I would try more conclusions of the same sort.</div><div class="sentence"> “You talk like an oracle.” I caught the infection from Euthyphro, who gave me a long lecture which began at dawn, and has not only entered into my ears, but filled my soul, and my intention is to yield to the inspiration to-day; and to-morrow I will be exorcised by some priest or sophist.</div><div class="sentence"> “Go on; I am anxious to hear the rest.” Now that we have a general notion, how shall we proceed?</div><div class="sentence"> What names will afford the most crucial test of natural fitness?</div><div class="sentence"> Those of heroes and ordinary men are often deceptive, because they are patronymics or expressions of a wish; let us try gods and demi-gods.</div><div class="sentence"> Gods are so called, apo tou thein, from the verb “to run;” because the sun, moon, and stars run about the heaven; and they being the original gods of the Hellenes, as they still are of the Barbarians, their name is given to all Gods.</div><div class="sentence"> The demons are the golden race of Hesiod, and by golden he means not literally golden, but good; and they are called demons, quasi daemones, which in old Attic was used for daimones—good men are well said to become daimones when they die, because they are knowing.</div><div class="sentence"> Eros (with an epsilon) is the same word as eros (with an eta): “the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair;” or perhaps they were a species of sophists or rhetoricians, and so called apo tou erotan, or eirein, from their habit of spinning questions; for eirein is equivalent to legein.</div><div class="sentence"> I get all this from Euthyphro; and now a new and ingenious idea comes into my mind, and, if I am not careful, I shall be wiser than I ought to be by to-morrow’s dawn.</div><div class="sentence"> My idea is, that we may put in and pull out letters at pleasure and alter the accents (as, for example, Dii philos may be turned into Diphilos), and we may make words into sentences and sentences into words.</div><div class="sentence"> The name anthrotos is a case in point, for a letter has been omitted and the accent changed; the original meaning being o anathron a opopen—he who looks up at what he sees.</div><div class="sentence"> Psuche may be thought to be the reviving, or refreshing, or animating principle—e anapsuchousa to soma; but I am afraid that Euthyphro and his disciples will scorn this derivation, and I must find another: shall we identify the soul with the “ordering mind” of Anaxagoras, and say that psuche, quasi phuseche = e phusin echei or ochei?—this might easily be refined into psyche.</div><div class="sentence"> “That is a more artistic etymology.”</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">029</span> <div class="sentence">  After psuche follows soma; this, by a slight permutation, may be either = (1) the “grave” of the soul, or (2) may mean “that by which the soul signifies (semainei) her wishes.” But more probably, the word is Orphic, and simply denotes that the body is the place of ward in which the soul suffers the penalty of sin,—en o sozetai.</div><div class="sentence"> “I should like to hear some more explanations of the names of the Gods, like that excellent one of Zeus.” The truest names of the Gods are those which they give themselves; but these are unknown to us.</div><div class="sentence"> Less true are those by which we propitiate them, as men say in prayers, “May he graciously receive any name by which I call him.” And to avoid offence, I should like to let them know beforehand that we are not presuming to enquire about them, but only about the names which they usually bear.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us begin with Hestia.</div><div class="sentence"> What did he mean who gave the name Hestia?</div><div class="sentence"> “That is a very difficult question.” O, my dear Hermogenes, I believe that there was a power of philosophy and talk among the first inventors of names, both in our own and in other languages; for even in foreign words a principle is discernible.</div><div class="sentence"> Hestia is the same with esia, which is an old form of ousia, and means the first principle of things: this agrees with the fact that to Hestia the first sacrifices are offered.</div><div class="sentence"> There is also another reading—osia, which implies that “pushing” (othoun) is the first principle of all things.</div><div class="sentence"> And here I seem to discover a delicate allusion to the flux of Heracleitus—that antediluvian philosopher who cannot walk twice in the same stream; and this flux of his may accomplish yet greater marvels.</div><div class="sentence"> For the names Cronos and Rhea cannot have been accidental; the giver of them must have known something about the doctrine of Heracleitus.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover, there is a remarkable coincidence in the words of Hesiod, when he speaks of Oceanus, “the origin of Gods;” and in the verse of Orpheus, in which he describes Oceanus espousing his sister Tethys.</div><div class="sentence"> Tethys is nothing more than the name of a spring—to diattomenon kai ethoumenon.</div><div class="sentence"> Poseidon is posidesmos, the chain of the feet, because you cannot walk on the sea—the epsilon is inserted by way of ornament; or perhaps the name may have been originally polleidon, meaning, that the God knew many things (polla eidos): he may also be the shaker, apo tou seiein,—in this case, pi and delta have been added.</div><div class="sentence"> Pluto is connected with ploutos, because wealth comes out of the earth; or the word may be a euphemism for Hades, which is usually derived apo tou aeidous, because the God is concerned with the invisible.</div><div class="sentence"> But the name Hades was really given him from his knowing (eidenai) all good things.</div><div class="sentence"> Men in general are foolishly afraid of him, and talk with horror of the world below from which no one may return.</div><div class="sentence"> The reason why his subjects never wish to come back, even if they could, is that the God enchains them by the strongest of spells, namely by the desire of virtue, which they hope to obtain by constant association with him.</div><div class="sentence"> He is the perfect and accomplished Sophist and the great benefactor of the other world; for he has much more than he wants there, and hence he is called Pluto or the rich.</div><div class="sentence"> He will have nothing to do with the souls of men while in the body, because he cannot work his will with them so long as they are confused and entangled by fleshly lusts.</div><div class="sentence"> Demeter is the mother and giver of food—e didousa meter tes edodes.</div><div class="sentence"> Here is erate tis, or perhaps the legislator may have been thinking of the weather, and has merely transposed the letters of the word aer.</div><div class="sentence"> Pherephatta, that word of awe, is pheretapha, which is only an euphonious contraction of e tou pheromenou ephaptomene,—all things are in motion, and she in her wisdom moves with them, and the wise God Hades consorts with her—there is nothing very terrible in this, any more than in the her other appellation Persephone, which is also significant of her wisdom (sophe).</div><div class="sentence"> Apollo is another name, which is supposed to have some dreadful meaning, but is susceptible of at least four perfectly innocent explanations.</div><div class="sentence"> First, he is the purifier or purger or absolver (apolouon); secondly, he is the true diviner, Aplos, as he is called in the Thessalian dialect (aplos = aplous, sincere); thirdly, he is the archer (aei ballon), always shooting; or again, supposing alpha to mean ama or omou, Apollo becomes equivalent to ama polon, which points to both his musical and his heavenly attributes; for there is a “moving together” alike in music and in the harmony of the spheres.</div><div class="sentence"> The second lambda is inserted in order to avoid the ill-omened sound of destruction.</div><div class="sentence"> The Muses are so called—apo tou mosthai.</div><div class="sentence"> The gentle Leto or Letho is named from her willingness (ethelemon), or because she is ready to forgive and forget (lethe).</div><div class="sentence"> Artemis is so called from her healthy well-balanced nature, dia to artemes, or as aretes istor; or as a lover of virginity, aroton misesasa.</div><div class="sentence"> One of these explanations is probably true,—perhaps all of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Dionysus is o didous ton oinon, and oinos is quasi oionous because wine makes those think (oiesthai) that they have a mind (nous) who have none.</div><div class="sentence"> The established derivation of Aphrodite dia ten tou athrou genesin may be accepted on the authority of Hesiod.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, there is the name of Pallas, or Athene, which we, who are Athenians, must not forget.</div><div class="sentence"> Pallas is derived from armed dances—apo tou pallein ta opla.</div><div class="sentence"> For Athene we must turn to the allegorical interpreters of Homer, who make the name equivalent to theonoe, or possibly the word was originally ethonoe and signified moral intelligence (en ethei noesis).</div><div class="sentence"> Hephaestus, again, is the lord of light—o tou phaeos istor.</div><div class="sentence"> This is a good notion; and, to prevent any other getting into our heads, let us go on to Ares.</div><div class="sentence"> He is the manly one (arren), or the unchangeable one (arratos).</div><div class="sentence"> Enough of the Gods; for, by the Gods, I am afraid of them; but if you suggest other words, you will see how the horses of Euthyphro prance.</div><div class="sentence"> “Only one more God; tell me about my godfather Hermes.” He is ermeneus, the messenger or cheater or thief or bargainer; or o eirein momenos, that is, eiremes or ermes—the speaker or contriver of speeches.</div><div class="sentence"> “Well said Cratylus, then, that I am no son of Hermes.” Pan, as the son of Hermes, is speech or the brother of speech, and is called Pan because speech indicates everything—o pan menuon.</div><div class="sentence"> He has two forms, a true and a false; and is in the upper part smooth, and in the lower part shaggy.</div><div class="sentence"> He is the goat of Tragedy, in which there are plenty of falsehoods.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">030</span> <div class="sentence">  “Will you go on to the elements—sun, moon, stars, earth, aether, air, fire, water, seasons, years?” Very good: and which shall I take first?</div><div class="sentence"> Let us begin with elios, or the sun.</div><div class="sentence"> The Doric form elios helps us to see that he is so called because at his rising he gathers (alizei) men together, or because he rolls about (eilei) the earth, or because he variegates (aiolei = poikillei) the earth.</div><div class="sentence"> Selene is an anticipation of Anaxagoras, being a contraction of selaenoneoaeia, the light (selas) which is ever old and new, and which, as Anaxagoras says, is borrowed from the sun; the name was harmonized into selanaia, a form which is still in use.</div><div class="sentence"> “That is a true dithyrambic name.” Meis is so called apo tou meiousthai, from suffering diminution, and astron is from astrape (lightning), which is an improvement of anastrope, that which turns the eyes inside out.</div><div class="sentence"> “How do you explain pur n udor?” I suspect that pur, which, like udor n kuon, is found in Phrygian, is a foreign word; for the Hellenes have borrowed much from the barbarians, and I always resort to this theory of a foreign origin when I am at a loss.</div><div class="sentence"> Aer may be explained, oti airei ta apo tes ges; or, oti aei rei; or, oti pneuma ex autou ginetai (compare the poetic word aetai).</div><div class="sentence"> So aither quasi aeitheer oti aei thei peri ton aera: ge, gaia quasi genneteira (compare the Homeric form gegaasi); ora (with an omega), or, according to the old Attic form ora (with an omicron), is derived apo tou orizein, because it divides the year; eniautos and etos are the same thought—o en eauto etazon, cut into two parts, en eauto and etazon, like di on ze into Dios and Zenos.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">031</span> <div class="sentence">  “You make surprising progress.” True; I am run away with, and am not even yet at my utmost speed.</div><div class="sentence"> “I should like very much to hear your account of the virtues.</div><div class="sentence"> What principle of correctness is there in those charming words, wisdom, understanding, justice, and the rest?” To explain all that will be a serious business; still, as I have put on the lion’s skin, appearances must be maintained.</div><div class="sentence"> My opinion is, that primitive men were like some modern philosophers, who, by always going round in their search after the nature of things, become dizzy; and this phenomenon, which was really in themselves, they imagined to take place in the external world.</div><div class="sentence"> You have no doubt remarked, that the doctrine of the universal flux, or generation of things, is indicated in names.</div><div class="sentence"> “No, I never did.” Phronesis is only phoras kai rou noesis, or perhaps phoras onesis, and in any case is connected with pheresthai; gnome is gones skepsis kai nomesis; noesis is neou or gignomenon esis; the word neos implies that creation is always going on—the original form was neoesis; sophrosune is soteria phroneseos; episteme is e epomene tois pragmasin—the faculty which keeps close, neither anticipating nor lagging behind; sunesis is equivalent to sunienai, sumporeuesthai ten psuche, and is a kind of conclusion—sullogismos tis, akin therefore in idea to episteme; sophia is very difficult, and has a foreign look—the meaning is, touching the motion or stream of things, and may be illustrated by the poetical esuthe and the Lacedaemonian proper name Sous, or Rush; agathon is ro agaston en te tachuteti,—for all things are in motion, and some are swifter than others: dikaiosune is clearly e tou dikaiou sunesis.</div><div class="sentence"> The word dikaion is more troublesome, and appears to mean the subtle penetrating power which, as the lovers of motion say, preserves all things, and is the cause of all things, quasi diaion going through—the letter kappa being inserted for the sake of euphony.</div><div class="sentence"> This is a great mystery which has been confided to me; but when I ask for an explanation I am thought obtrusive, and another derivation is proposed to me.</div><div class="sentence"> Justice is said to be o kaion, or the sun; and when I joyfully repeat this beautiful notion, I am answered, “What, is there no justice when the sun is down?” And when I entreat my questioner to tell me his own opinion, he replies, that justice is fire in the abstract, or heat in the abstract; which is not very intelligible.</div><div class="sentence"> Others laugh at such notions, and say with Anaxagoras, that justice is the ordering mind.</div><div class="sentence"> “I think that some one must have told you this.” And not the rest?</div><div class="sentence"> Let me proceed then, in the hope of proving to you my originality.</div><div class="sentence"> Andreia is quasi anpeia quasi e ano roe, the stream which flows upwards, and is opposed to injustice, which clearly hinders the principle of penetration; arren and aner have a similar derivation; gune is the same as gone; thelu is derived apo tes theles, because the teat makes things flourish (tethelenai), and the word thallein itself implies increase of youth, which is swift and sudden ever (thein and allesthai).</div><div class="sentence"> I am getting over the ground fast: but much has still to be explained.</div><div class="sentence"> There is techne, for instance.</div><div class="sentence"> This, by an aphaeresis of tau and an epenthesis of omicron in two places, may be identified with echonoe, and signifies “that which has mind.”</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">032</span> <div class="sentence">  “A very poor etymology.” Yes; but you must remember that all language is in process of change; letters are taken in and put out for the sake of euphony, and time is also a great alterer of words.</div><div class="sentence"> For example, what business has the letter rho in the word katoptron, or the letter sigma in the word sphigx?</div><div class="sentence"> The additions are often such that it is impossible to make out the original word; and yet, if you may put in and pull out, as you like, any name is equally good for any object.</div><div class="sentence"> The fact is, that great dictators of literature like yourself should observe the rules of moderation.</div><div class="sentence"> “I will do my best.” But do not be too much of a precisian, or you will paralyze me.</div><div class="sentence"> If you will let me add mechane, apo tou mekous, which means polu, and anein, I shall be at the summit of my powers, from which elevation I will examine the two words kakia and arete.</div><div class="sentence"> The first is easily explained in accordance with what has preceded; for all things being in a flux, kakia is to kakos ion.</div><div class="sentence"> This derivation is illustrated by the word deilia, which ought to have come after andreia, and may be regarded as o lian desmos tes psuches, just as aporia signifies an impediment to motion (from alpha not, and poreuesthai to go), and arete is euporia, which is the opposite of this—the everflowing (aei reousa or aeireite), or the eligible, quasi airete.</div><div class="sentence"> You will think that I am inventing, but I say that if kakia is right, then arete is also right.</div><div class="sentence"> But what is kakon?</div><div class="sentence"> That is a very obscure word, to which I can only apply my old notion and declare that kakon is a foreign word.</div><div class="sentence"> Next, let us proceed to kalon, aischron.</div><div class="sentence"> The latter is doubtless contracted from aeischoroun, quasi aei ischon roun.</div><div class="sentence"> The inventor of words being a patron of the flux, was a great enemy to stagnation.</div><div class="sentence"> Kalon is to kaloun ta pragmata—this is mind (nous or dianoia); which is also the principle of beauty; and which doing the works of beauty, is therefore rightly called the beautiful.</div><div class="sentence"> The meaning of sumpheron is explained by previous examples;—like episteme, signifying that the soul moves in harmony with the world (sumphora, sumpheronta).</div><div class="sentence"> Kerdos is to pasi kerannumenon—that which mingles with all things: lusiteloun is equivalent to to tes phoras luon to telos, and is not to be taken in the vulgar sense of gainful, but rather in that of swift, being the principle which makes motion immortal and unceasing; ophelimon is apo tou ophellein—that which gives increase: this word, which is Homeric, is of foreign origin.</div><div class="sentence"> Blaberon is to blamton or boulomenon aptein tou rou—that which injures or seeks to bind the stream.</div><div class="sentence"> The proper word would be boulapteroun, but this is too much of a mouthful—like a prelude on the flute in honour of Athene.</div><div class="sentence"> The word zemiodes is difficult; great changes, as I was saying, have been made in words, and even a small change will alter their meaning very much.</div><div class="sentence"> The word deon is one of these disguised words.</div><div class="sentence"> You know that according to the old pronunciation, which is especially affected by the women, who are great conservatives, iota and delta were used where we should now use eta and zeta: for example, what we now call emera was formerly called imera; and this shows the meaning of the word to have been “the desired one coming after night,” and not, as is often supposed, “that which makes things gentle” (emera).</div><div class="sentence"> So again, zugon is duogon, quasi desis duein eis agogen—(the binding of two together for the purpose of drawing.)</div><div class="sentence"> Deon, as ordinarily written, has an evil sense, signifying the chain (desmos) or hindrance of motion; but in its ancient form dion is expressive of good, quasi diion, that which penetrates or goes through all.</div><div class="sentence"> Zemiodes is really demiodes, and means that which binds motion (dounti to ion): edone is e pros ten onrsin teinousa praxis—the delta is an insertion: lupe is derived apo tes dialuseos tou somatos: ania is from alpha and ienai, to go: algedon is a foreign word, and is so called apo tou algeinou: odune is apo tes enduseos tes lupes: achthedon is in its very sound a burden: chapa expresses the flow of soul: terpsis is apo tou terpnou, and terpnon is properly erpnon, because the sensation of pleasure is likened to a breath (pnoe) which creeps (erpei) through the soul: euphrosune is named from pheresthai, because the soul moves in harmony with nature: epithumia is e epi ton thumon iousa dunamis: thumos is apo tes thuseos tes psuches: imeros—oti eimenos pei e psuche: pothos, the desire which is in another place, allothi pou: eros was anciently esros, and so called because it flows into (esrei) the soul from without: doxa is e dioxis tou eidenai, or expresses the shooting from a bow (toxon).</div><div class="sentence"> The latter etymology is confirmed by the words boulesthai, boule, aboulia, which all have to do with shooting (bole): and similarly oiesis is nothing but the movement (oisis) of the soul towards essence.</div><div class="sentence"> Ekousion is to eikon—the yielding—anagke is e an agke iousa, the passage through ravines which impede motion: aletheia is theia ale, divine motion.</div><div class="sentence"> Pseudos is the opposite of this, implying the principle of constraint and forced repose, which is expressed under the figure of sleep, to eudon; the psi is an addition.</div><div class="sentence"> Onoma, a name, affirms the real existence of that which is sought after—on ou masma estin.</div><div class="sentence"> On and ousia are only ion with an iota broken off; and ouk on is ouk ion.</div><div class="sentence"> “And what are ion, reon, doun?” One way of explaining them has been already suggested—they may be of foreign origin; and possibly this is the true answer.</div><div class="sentence"> But mere antiquity may often prevent our recognizing words, after all the complications which they have undergone; and we must remember that however far we carry back our analysis some ultimate elements or roots will remain which can be no further analyzed.</div><div class="sentence"> For example; the word agathos was supposed by us to be a compound of agastos and thoos, and probably thoos may be further resolvable.</div><div class="sentence"> But if we take a word of which no further resolution seems attainable, we may fairly conclude that we have reached one of these original elements, and the truth of such a word must be tested by some new method.</div><div class="sentence"> Will you help me in the search?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">033</span> <div class="sentence">  All names, whether primary or secondary, are intended to show the nature of things; and the secondary, as I conceive, derive their significance from the primary.</div><div class="sentence"> But then, how do the primary names indicate anything?</div><div class="sentence"> And let me ask another question,—If we had no faculty of speech, how should we communicate with one another?</div><div class="sentence"> Should we not use signs, like the deaf and dumb?</div><div class="sentence"> The elevation of our hands would mean lightness—heaviness would be expressed by letting them drop.</div><div class="sentence"> The running of any animal would be described by a similar movement of our own frames.</div><div class="sentence"> The body can only express anything by imitation; and the tongue or mouth can imitate as well as the rest of the body.</div><div class="sentence"> But this imitation of the tongue or voice is not yet a name, because people may imitate sheep or goats without naming them.</div><div class="sentence"> What, then, is a name?</div><div class="sentence"> In the first place, a name is not a musical, or, secondly, a pictorial imitation, but an imitation of that kind which expresses the nature of a thing; and is the invention not of a musician, or of a painter, but of a namer.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">034</span> <div class="sentence">  And now, I think that we may consider the names about which you were asking.</div><div class="sentence"> The way to analyze them will be by going back to the letters, or primary elements of which they are composed.</div><div class="sentence"> First, we separate the alphabet into classes of letters, distinguishing the consonants, mutes, vowels, and semivowels; and when we have learnt them singly, we shall learn to know them in their various combinations of two or more letters; just as the painter knows how to use either a single colour, or a combination of colours.</div><div class="sentence"> And like the painter, we may apply letters to the expression of objects, and form them into syllables; and these again into words, until the picture or figure—that is, language—is completed.</div><div class="sentence"> Not that I am literally speaking of ourselves, but I mean to say that this was the way in which the ancients framed language.</div><div class="sentence"> And this leads me to consider whether the primary as well as the secondary elements are rightly given.</div><div class="sentence"> I may remark, as I was saying about the Gods, that we can only attain to conjecture of them.</div><div class="sentence"> But still we insist that ours is the true and only method of discovery; otherwise we must have recourse, like the tragic poets, to a Deus ex machina, and say that God gave the first names, and therefore they are right; or that the barbarians are older than we are, and that we learnt of them; or that antiquity has cast a veil over the truth.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet all these are not reasons; they are only ingenious excuses for having no reasons.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">035</span> <div class="sentence">  I will freely impart to you my own notions, though they are somewhat crude:—the letter rho appears to me to be the general instrument which the legislator has employed to express all motion or kinesis.</div><div class="sentence"> (I ought to explain that kinesis is just iesis (going), for the letter eta was unknown to the ancients; and the root, kiein, is a foreign form of ienai: of kinesis or eisis, the opposite is stasis).</div><div class="sentence"> This use of rho is evident in the words tremble, break, crush, crumble, and the like; the imposer of names perceived that the tongue is most agitated in the pronunciation of this letter, just as he used iota to express the subtle power which penetrates through all things.</div><div class="sentence"> The letters phi, psi, sigma, zeta, which require a great deal of wind, are employed in the imitation of such notions as shivering, seething, shaking, and in general of what is windy.</div><div class="sentence"> The letters delta and tau convey the idea of binding and rest in a place: the lambda denotes smoothness, as in the words slip, sleek, sleep, and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> But when the slipping tongue is detained by the heavier sound of gamma, then arises the notion of a glutinous clammy nature: nu is sounded from within, and has a notion of inwardness: alpha is the expression of size; eta of length; omicron of roundness, and therefore there is plenty of omicron in the word goggulon.</div><div class="sentence"> That is my view, Hermogenes, of the correctness of names; and I should like to hear what Cratylus would say.</div><div class="sentence"> “But, Socrates, as I was telling you, Cratylus mystifies me; I should like to ask him, in your presence, what he means by the fitness of names?” To this appeal, Cratylus replies “that he cannot explain so important a subject all in a moment.” “No, but you may ‘add little to little,’ as Hesiod says.” Socrates here interposes his own request, that Cratylus will give some account of his theory.</div><div class="sentence"> Hermogenes and himself are mere sciolists, but Cratylus has reflected on these matters, and has had teachers.</div><div class="sentence"> Cratylus replies in the words of Achilles: “‘Illustrious Ajax, you have spoken in all things much to my mind,’ whether Euthyphro, or some Muse inhabiting your own breast, was the inspirer.” Socrates replies, that he is afraid of being self-deceived, and therefore he must “look fore and aft,” as Homer remarks.</div><div class="sentence"> Does not Cratylus agree with him that names teach us the nature of things?</div><div class="sentence"> “Yes.” And naming is an art, and the artists are legislators, and like artists in general, some of them are better and some of them are worse than others, and give better or worse laws, and make better or worse names.</div><div class="sentence"> Cratylus cannot admit that one name is better than another; they are either true names, or they are not names at all; and when he is asked about the name of Hermogenes, who is acknowledged to have no luck in him, he affirms this to be the name of somebody else.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates supposes him to mean that falsehood is impossible, to which his own answer would be, that there has never been a lack of liars.</div><div class="sentence"> Cratylus presses him with the old sophistical argument, that falsehood is saying that which is not, and therefore saying nothing;—you cannot utter the word which is not.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates complains that this argument is too subtle for an old man to understand: Suppose a person addressing Cratylus were to say, Hail, Athenian Stranger, Hermogenes!</div><div class="sentence"> would these words be true or false?</div><div class="sentence"> “I should say that they would be mere unmeaning sounds, like the hammering of a brass pot.” But you would acknowledge that names, as well as pictures, are imitations, and also that pictures may give a right or wrong representation of a man or woman:—why may not names then equally give a representation true and right or false and wrong?</div><div class="sentence"> Cratylus admits that pictures may give a true or false representation, but denies that names can.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates argues, that he may go up to a man and say “this is year picture,” and again, he may go and say to him “this is your name”—in the one case appealing to his sense of sight, and in the other to his sense of hearing;—may he not?</div><div class="sentence"> “Yes.” Then you will admit that there is a right or a wrong assignment of names, and if of names, then of verbs and nouns; and if of verbs and nouns, then of the sentences which are made up of them; and comparing nouns to pictures, you may give them all the appropriate sounds, or only some of them.</div><div class="sentence"> And as he who gives all the colours makes a good picture, and he who gives only some of them, a bad or imperfect one, but still a picture; so he who gives all the sounds makes a good name, and he who gives only some of them, a bad or imperfect one, but a name still.</div><div class="sentence"> The artist of names, that is, the legislator, may be a good or he may be a bad artist.</div><div class="sentence"> “Yes, Socrates, but the cases are not parallel; for if you subtract or misplace a letter, the name ceases to be a name.” Socrates admits that the number 10, if an unit is subtracted, would cease to be 10, but denies that names are of this purely quantitative nature.</div><div class="sentence"> Suppose that there are two objects—Cratylus and the image of Cratylus; and let us imagine that some God makes them perfectly alike, both in their outward form and in their inner nature and qualities: then there will be two Cratyluses, and not merely Cratylus and the image of Cratylus.</div><div class="sentence"> But an image in fact always falls short in some degree of the original, and if images are not exact counterparts, why should names be?</div><div class="sentence"> if they were, they would be the doubles of their originals, and indistinguishable from them; and how ridiculous would this be!</div><div class="sentence"> Cratylus admits the truth of Socrates’ remark.</div><div class="sentence"> But then Socrates rejoins, he should have the courage to acknowledge that letters may be wrongly inserted in a noun, or a noun in a sentence; and yet the noun or the sentence may retain a meaning.</div><div class="sentence"> Better to admit this, that we may not be punished like the traveller in Egina who goes about at night, and that Truth herself may not say to us, “Too late.” And, errors excepted, we may still affirm that a name to be correct must have proper letters, which bear a resemblance to the thing signified.</div><div class="sentence"> I must remind you of what Hermogenes and I were saying about the letter rho accent, which was held to be expressive of motion and hardness, as lambda is of smoothness;—and this you will admit to be their natural meaning.</div><div class="sentence"> But then, why do the Eritreans call that skleroter which we call sklerotes?</div><div class="sentence"> We can understand one another, although the letter rho accent is not equivalent to the letter s: why is this?</div><div class="sentence"> You reply, because the two letters are sufficiently alike for the purpose of expressing motion.</div><div class="sentence"> Well, then, there is the letter lambda; what business has this in a word meaning hardness?</div><div class="sentence"> “Why, Socrates, I retort upon you, that we put in and pull out letters at pleasure.” And the explanation of this is custom or agreement: we have made a convention that the rho shall mean s and a convention may indicate by the unlike as well as by the like.</div><div class="sentence"> How could there be names for all the numbers unless you allow that convention is used?</div><div class="sentence"> Imitation is a poor thing, and has to be supplemented by convention, which is another poor thing; although I agree with you in thinking that the most perfect form of language is found only where there is a perfect correspondence of sound and meaning.</div><div class="sentence"> But let me ask you what is the use and force of names?</div><div class="sentence"> “The use of names, Socrates, is to inform, and he who knows names knows things.” Do you mean that the discovery of names is the same as the discovery of things?</div><div class="sentence"> “Yes.” But do you not see that there is a degree of deception about names?</div><div class="sentence"> He who first gave names, gave them according to his conception, and that may have been erroneous.</div><div class="sentence"> “But then, why, Socrates, is language so consistent?</div><div class="sentence"> all words have the same laws.” Mere consistency is no test of truth.</div><div class="sentence"> In geometrical problems, for example, there may be a flaw at the beginning, and yet the conclusion may follow consistently.</div><div class="sentence"> And, therefore, a wise man will take especial care of first principles.</div><div class="sentence"> But are words really consistent; are there not as many terms of praise which signify rest as which signify motion?</div><div class="sentence"> There is episteme, which is connected with stasis, as mneme is with meno.</div><div class="sentence"> Bebaion, again, is the expression of station and position; istoria is clearly descriptive of the stopping istanai of the stream; piston indicates the cessation of motion; and there are many words having a bad sense, which are connected with ideas of motion, such as sumphora, amartia, etc.</div><div class="sentence"> : amathia, again, might be explained, as e ama theo iontos poreia, and akolasia as e akolouthia tois pragmasin.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus the bad names are framed on the same principle as the good, and other examples might be given, which would favour a theory of rest rather than of motion.</div><div class="sentence"> “Yes; but the greater number of words express motion.” Are we to count them, Cratylus; and is correctness of names to be determined by the voice of a majority?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">036</span> <div class="sentence">  Here is another point: we were saying that the legislator gives names; and therefore we must suppose that he knows the things which he names: but how can he have learnt things from names before there were any names?</div><div class="sentence"> “I believe, Socrates, that some power more than human first gave things their names, and that these were necessarily true names.” Then how came the giver of names to contradict himself, and to make some names expressive of rest, and others of motion?</div><div class="sentence"> “I do not suppose that he did make them both.” Then which did he make—those which are expressive of rest, or those which are expressive of motion?...But if some names are true and others false, we can only decide between them, not by counting words, but by appealing to things.</div><div class="sentence"> And, if so, we must allow that things may be known without names; for names, as we have several times admitted, are the images of things; and the higher knowledge is of things, and is not to be derived from names; and though I do not doubt that the inventors of language gave names, under the idea that all things are in a state of motion and flux, I believe that they were mistaken; and that having fallen into a whirlpool themselves, they are trying to drag us after them.</div><div class="sentence"> For is there not a true beauty and a true good, which is always beautiful and always good?</div><div class="sentence"> Can the thing beauty be vanishing away from us while the words are yet in our mouths?</div><div class="sentence"> And they could not be known by any one if they are always passing away—for if they are always passing away, the observer has no opportunity of observing their state.</div><div class="sentence"> Whether the doctrine of the flux or of the eternal nature be the truer, is hard to determine.</div><div class="sentence"> But no man of sense will put himself, or the education of his mind, in the power of names: he will not condemn himself to be an unreal thing, nor will he believe that everything is in a flux like the water in a leaky vessel, or that the world is a man who has a running at the nose.</div><div class="sentence"> This doctrine may be true, Cratylus, but is also very likely to be untrue; and therefore I would have you reflect while you are young, and find out the truth, and when you know come and tell me.</div><div class="sentence"> “I have thought, Socrates, and after a good deal of thinking I incline to Heracleitus.” Then another day, my friend, you shall give me a lesson.</div><div class="sentence"> “Very good, Socrates, and I hope that you will continue to study these things yourself.”</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">037</span> <div class="sentence">  We may now consider (I) how far Plato in the Cratylus has discovered the true principles of language, and then (II) proceed to compare modern speculations respecting the origin and nature of language with the anticipations of his genius.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">038</span> <div class="sentence">  I.</div><div class="sentence"> (1) Plato is aware that language is not the work of chance; nor does he deny that there is a natural fitness in names.</div><div class="sentence"> He only insists that this natural fitness shall be intelligibly explained.</div><div class="sentence"> But he has no idea that language is a natural organism.</div><div class="sentence"> He would have heard with surprise that languages are the common work of whole nations in a primitive or semi-barbarous age.</div><div class="sentence"> How, he would probably have argued, could men devoid of art have contrived a structure of such complexity?</div><div class="sentence"> No answer could have been given to this question, either in ancient or in modern times, until the nature of primitive antiquity had been thoroughly studied, and the instincts of man had been shown to exist in greater force, when his state approaches more nearly to that of children or animals.</div><div class="sentence"> The philosophers of the last century, after their manner, would have vainly endeavoured to trace the process by which proper names were converted into common, and would have shown how the last effort of abstraction invented prepositions and auxiliaries.</div><div class="sentence"> The theologian would have proved that language must have had a divine origin, because in childhood, while the organs are pliable, the intelligence is wanting, and when the intelligence is able to frame conceptions, the organs are no longer able to express them.</div><div class="sentence"> Or, as others have said: Man is man because he has the gift of speech; and he could not have invented that which he is.</div><div class="sentence"> But this would have been an “argument too subtle” for Socrates, who rejects the theological account of the origin of language “as an excuse for not giving a reason,” which he compares to the introduction of the “Deus ex machina” by the tragic poets when they have to solve a difficulty; thus anticipating many modern controversies in which the primary agency of the divine Being is confused with the secondary cause; and God is assumed to have worked a miracle in order to fill up a lacuna in human knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Timaeus.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span> <div class="sentence">  Neither is Plato wrong in supposing that an element of design and art enters into language.</div><div class="sentence"> The creative power abating is supplemented by a mechanical process.</div><div class="sentence"> “Languages are not made but grow,” but they are made as well as grow; bursting into life like a plant or a flower, they are also capable of being trained and improved and engrafted upon one another.</div><div class="sentence"> The change in them is effected in earlier ages by musical and euphonic improvements, at a later stage by the influence of grammar and logic, and by the poetical and literary use of words.</div><div class="sentence"> They develope rapidly in childhood, and when they are full grown and set they may still put forth intellectual powers, like the mind in the body, or rather we may say that the nobler use of language only begins when the frame-work is complete.</div><div class="sentence"> The savage or primitive man, in whom the natural instinct is strongest, is also the greatest improver of the forms of language.</div><div class="sentence"> He is the poet or maker of words, as in civilised ages the dialectician is the definer or distinguisher of them.</div><div class="sentence"> The latter calls the second world of abstract terms into existence, as the former has created the picture sounds which represent natural objects or processes.</div><div class="sentence"> Poetry and philosophy—these two, are the two great formative principles of language, when they have passed their first stage, of which, as of the first invention of the arts in general, we only entertain conjecture.</div><div class="sentence"> And mythology is a link between them, connecting the visible and invisible, until at length the sensuous exterior falls away, and the severance of the inner and outer world, of the idea and the object of sense, becomes complete.</div><div class="sentence"> At a later period, logic and grammar, sister arts, preserve and enlarge the decaying instinct of language, by rule and method, which they gather from analysis and observation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">040</span> <div class="sentence">  (2) There is no trace in any of Plato’s writings that he was acquainted with any language but Greek.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet he has conceived very truly the relation of Greek to foreign languages, which he is led to consider, because he finds that many Greek words are incapable of explanation.</div><div class="sentence"> Allowing a good deal for accident, and also for the fancies of the conditores linguae Graecae, there is an element of which he is unable to give an account.</div><div class="sentence"> These unintelligible words he supposes to be of foreign origin, and to have been derived from a time when the Greeks were either barbarians, or in close relations to the barbarians.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates is aware that this principle is liable to great abuse; and, like the “Deus ex machina,” explains nothing.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence he excuses himself for the employment of such a device, and remarks that in foreign words there is still a principle of correctness, which applies equally both to Greeks and barbarians.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">041</span> <div class="sentence">  (3) But the greater number of primary words do not admit of derivation from foreign languages; they must be resolved into the letters out of which they are composed, and therefore the letters must have a meaning.</div><div class="sentence"> The framers of language were aware of this; they observed that alpha was adapted to express size; eta length; omicron roundness; nu inwardness; rho accent rush or roar; lambda liquidity; gamma lambda the detention of the liquid or slippery element; delta and tau binding; phi, psi, sigma, xi, wind and cold, and so on.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato’s analysis of the letters of the alphabet shows a wonderful insight into the nature of language.</div><div class="sentence"> He does not expressively distinguish between mere imitation and the symbolical use of sound to express thought, but he recognises in the examples which he gives both modes of imitation.</div><div class="sentence"> Gesture is the mode which a deaf and dumb person would take of indicating his meaning.</div><div class="sentence"> And language is the gesture of the tongue; in the use of the letter rho accent, to express a rushing or roaring, or of omicron to express roundness, there is a direct imitation; while in the use of the letter alpha to express size, or of eta to express length, the imitation is symbolical.</div><div class="sentence"> The use of analogous or similar sounds, in order to express similar analogous ideas, seems to have escaped him.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">042</span> <div class="sentence">  In passing from the gesture of the body to the movement of the tongue, Plato makes a great step in the physiology of language.</div><div class="sentence"> He was probably the first who said that “language is imitative sound,” which is the greatest and deepest truth of philology; although he is not aware of the laws of euphony and association by which imitation must be regulated.</div><div class="sentence"> He was probably also the first who made a distinction between simple and compound words, a truth second only in importance to that which has just been mentioned.</div><div class="sentence"> His great insight in one direction curiously contrasts with his blindness in another; for he appears to be wholly unaware (compare his derivation of agathos from agastos and thoos) of the difference between the root and termination.</div><div class="sentence"> But we must recollect that he was necessarily more ignorant than any schoolboy of Greek grammar, and had no table of the inflexions of verbs and nouns before his eyes, which might have suggested to him the distinction.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">043</span> <div class="sentence">  (4) Plato distinctly affirms that language is not truth, or “philosophie une langue bien faite.” At first, Socrates has delighted himself with discovering the flux of Heracleitus in language.</div><div class="sentence"> But he is covertly satirising the pretence of that or any other age to find philosophy in words; and he afterwards corrects any erroneous inference which might be gathered from his experiment.</div><div class="sentence"> For he finds as many, or almost as many, words expressive of rest, as he had previously found expressive of motion.</div><div class="sentence"> And even if this had been otherwise, who would learn of words when he might learn of things?</div><div class="sentence"> There is a great controversy and high argument between Heracleiteans and Eleatics, but no man of sense would commit his soul in such enquiries to the imposers of names...In this and other passages Plato shows that he is as completely emancipated from the influence of “Idols of the tribe” as Bacon himself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">044</span> <div class="sentence">  The lesson which may be gathered from words is not metaphysical or moral, but historical.</div><div class="sentence"> They teach us the affinity of races, they tell us something about the association of ideas, they occasionally preserve the memory of a disused custom; but we cannot safely argue from them about right and wrong, matter and mind, freedom and necessity, or the other problems of moral and metaphysical philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> For the use of words on such subjects may often be metaphorical, accidental, derived from other languages, and may have no relation to the contemporary state of thought and feeling.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor in any case is the invention of them the result of philosophical reflection; they have been commonly transferred from matter to mind, and their meaning is the very reverse of their etymology.</div><div class="sentence"> Because there is or is not a name for a thing, we cannot argue that the thing has or has not an actual existence; or that the antitheses, parallels, conjugates, correlatives of language have anything corresponding to them in nature.</div><div class="sentence"> There are too many words as well as too few; and they generalize the objects or ideas which they represent.</div><div class="sentence"> The greatest lesson which the philosophical analysis of language teaches us is, that we should be above language, making words our servants, and not allowing them to be our masters.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">045</span> <div class="sentence">  Plato does not add the further observation, that the etymological meaning of words is in process of being lost.</div><div class="sentence"> If at first framed on a principle of intelligibility, they would gradually cease to be intelligible, like those of a foreign language, he is willing to admit that they are subject to many changes, and put on many disguises.</div><div class="sentence"> He acknowledges that the “poor creature” imitation is supplemented by another “poor creature,”—convention.</div><div class="sentence"> But he does not see that “habit and repute,” and their relation to other words, are always exercising an influence over them.</div><div class="sentence"> Words appear to be isolated, but they are really the parts of an organism which is always being reproduced.</div><div class="sentence"> They are refined by civilization, harmonized by poetry, emphasized by literature, technically applied in philosophy and art; they are used as symbols on the border-ground of human knowledge; they receive a fresh impress from individual genius, and come with a new force and association to every lively-minded person.</div><div class="sentence"> They are fixed by the simultaneous utterance of millions, and yet are always imperceptibly changing;—not the inventors of language, but writing and speaking, and particularly great writers, or works which pass into the hearts of nations, Homer, Shakespear, Dante, the German or English Bible, Kant and Hegel, are the makers of them in later ages.</div><div class="sentence"> They carry with them the faded recollection of their own past history; the use of a word in a striking and familiar passage gives a complexion to its use everywhere else, and the new use of an old and familiar phrase has also a peculiar power over us.</div><div class="sentence"> But these and other subtleties of language escaped the observation of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> He is not aware that the languages of the world are organic structures, and that every word in them is related to every other; nor does he conceive of language as the joint work of the speaker and the hearer, requiring in man a faculty not only of expressing his thoughts but of understanding those of others.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">051</span> <div class="sentence">  Speaking is one of the simplest natural operations, and also the most complex.</div><div class="sentence"> Nothing would seem to be easier or more trivial than a few words uttered by a child in any language.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet into the formation of those words have entered causes which the human mind is not capable of calculating.</div><div class="sentence"> They are a drop or two of the great stream or ocean of speech which has been flowing in all ages.</div><div class="sentence"> They have been transmitted from one language to another; like the child himself, they go back to the beginnings of the human race.</div><div class="sentence"> How they originated, who can tell?</div><div class="sentence"> Nevertheless we can imagine a stage of human society in which the circle of men’s minds was narrower and their sympathies and instincts stronger; in which their organs of speech were more flexible, and the sense of hearing finer and more discerning; in which they lived more in company, and after the manner of children were more given to express their feelings; in which “they moved all together,” like a herd of wild animals, “when they moved at all.” Among them, as in every society, a particular person would be more sensitive and intelligent than the rest.</div><div class="sentence"> Suddenly, on some occasion of interest (at the approach of a wild beast, shall we say?</div><div class="sentence"> ), he first, they following him, utter a cry which resounds through the forest.</div><div class="sentence"> The cry is almost or quite involuntary, and may be an imitation of the roar of the animal.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus far we have not speech, but only the inarticulate expression of feeling or emotion in no respect differing from the cries of animals; for they too call to one another and are answered.</div><div class="sentence"> But now suppose that some one at a distance not only hears the sound, but apprehends the meaning: or we may imagine that the cry is repeated to a member of the society who had been absent; the others act the scene over again when he returns home in the evening.</div><div class="sentence"> And so the cry becomes a word.</div><div class="sentence"> The hearer in turn gives back the word to the speaker, who is now aware that he has acquired a new power.</div><div class="sentence"> Many thousand times he exercises this power; like a child learning to talk, he repeats the same cry again, and again he is answered; he tries experiments with a like result, and the speaker and the hearer rejoice together in their newly-discovered faculty.</div><div class="sentence"> At first there would be few such cries, and little danger of mistaking or confusing them.</div><div class="sentence"> For the mind of primitive man had a narrow range of perceptions and feelings; his senses were microscopic; twenty or thirty sounds or gestures would be enough for him, nor would he have any difficulty in finding them.</div><div class="sentence"> Naturally he broke out into speech—like the young infant he laughed and babbled; but not until there were hearers as well as speakers did language begin.</div><div class="sentence"> Not the interjection or the vocal imitation of the object, but the interjection or the vocal imitation of the object understood, is the first rudiment of human speech.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">052</span> <div class="sentence">  After a while the word gathers associations, and has an independent existence.</div><div class="sentence"> The imitation of the lion’s roar calls up the fears and hopes of the chase, which are excited by his appearance.</div><div class="sentence"> In the moment of hearing the sound, without any appreciable interval, these and other latent experiences wake up in the mind of the hearer.</div><div class="sentence"> Not only does he receive an impression, but he brings previous knowledge to bear upon that impression.</div><div class="sentence"> Necessarily the pictorial image becomes less vivid, while the association of the nature and habits of the animal is more distinctly perceived.</div><div class="sentence"> The picture passes into a symbol, for there would be too many of them and they would crowd the mind; the vocal imitation, too, is always in process of being lost and being renewed, just as the picture is brought back again in the description of the poet.</div><div class="sentence"> Words now can be used more freely because there are more of them.</div><div class="sentence"> What was once an involuntary expression becomes voluntary.</div><div class="sentence"> Not only can men utter a cry or call, but they can communicate and converse; they can not only use words, but they can even play with them.</div><div class="sentence"> The word is separated both from the object and from the mind; and slowly nations and individuals attain to a fuller consciousness of themselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">053</span> <div class="sentence">  Parallel with this mental process the articulation of sounds is gradually becoming perfected.</div><div class="sentence"> The finer sense detects the differences of them, and begins, first to agglomerate, then to distinguish them.</div><div class="sentence"> Times, persons, places, relations of all kinds, are expressed by modifications of them.</div><div class="sentence"> The earliest parts of speech, as we may call them by anticipation, like the first utterances of children, probably partook of the nature of interjections and nouns; then came verbs; at length the whole sentence appeared, and rhythm and metre followed.</div><div class="sentence"> Each stage in the progress of language was accompanied by some corresponding stage in the mind and civilisation of man.</div><div class="sentence"> In time, when the family became a nation, the wild growth of dialects passed into a language.</div><div class="sentence"> Then arose poetry and literature.</div><div class="sentence"> We can hardly realize to ourselves how much with each improvement of language the powers of the human mind were enlarged; how the inner world took the place of outer; how the pictorial or symbolical or analogical word was refined into a notion; how language, fair and large and free, was at last complete.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">054</span> <div class="sentence">  So we may imagine the speech of man to have begun as with the cries of animals, or the stammering lips of children, and to have attained by degrees the perfection of Homer and Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet we are far from saying that this or any other theory of language is proved by facts.</div><div class="sentence"> It is not difficult to form an hypothesis which by a series of imaginary transitions will bridge over the chasm which separates man from the animals.</div><div class="sentence"> Differences of kind may often be thus resolved into differences of degree.</div><div class="sentence"> But we must not assume that we have in this way discovered the true account of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Through what struggles the harmonious use of the organs of speech was acquired; to what extent the conditions of human life were different; how far the genius of individuals may have contributed to the discovery of this as of the other arts, we cannot say: Only we seem to see that language is as much the creation of the ear as of the tongue, and the expression of a movement stirring the hearts not of one man only but of many, “as the trees of the wood are stirred by the wind.” The theory is consistent or not inconsistent with our own mental experience, and throws some degree of light upon a dark corner of the human mind.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">055</span> <div class="sentence">  In the later analysis of language, we trace the opposite and contrasted elements of the individual and nation, of the past and present, of the inward and outward, of the subject and object, of the notional and relational, of the root or unchanging part of the word and of the changing inflexion, if such a distinction be admitted, of the vowel and the consonant, of quantity and accent, of speech and writing, of poetry and prose.</div><div class="sentence"> We observe also the reciprocal influence of sounds and conceptions on each other, like the connexion of body and mind; and further remark that although the names of objects were originally proper names, as the grammarian or logician might call them, yet at a later stage they become universal notions, which combine into particulars and individuals, and are taken out of the first rude agglomeration of sounds that they may be replaced in a higher and more logical order.</div><div class="sentence"> We see that in the simplest sentences are contained grammar and logic—the parts of speech, the Eleatic philosophy and the Kantian categories.</div><div class="sentence"> So complex is language, and so expressive not only of the meanest wants of man, but of his highest thoughts; so various are the aspects in which it is regarded by us.</div><div class="sentence"> Then again, when we follow the history of languages, we observe that they are always slowly moving, half dead, half alive, half solid, half fluid; the breath of a moment, yet like the air, continuous in all ages and countries,—like the glacier, too, containing within them a trickling stream which deposits debris of the rocks over which it passes.</div><div class="sentence"> There were happy moments, as we may conjecture, in the lives of nations, at which they came to the birth—as in the golden age of literature, the man and the time seem to conspire; the eloquence of the bard or chief, as in later times the creations of the great writer who is the expression of his age, became impressed on the minds of their countrymen, perhaps in the hour of some crisis of national development—a migration, a conquest, or the like.</div><div class="sentence"> The picture of the word which was beginning to be lost, is now revived; the sound again echoes to the sense; men find themselves capable not only of expressing more feelings, and describing more objects, but of expressing and describing them better.</div><div class="sentence"> The world before the flood, that is to say, the world of ten, twenty, a hundred thousand years ago, has passed away and left no sign.</div><div class="sentence"> But the best conception that we can form of it, though imperfect and uncertain, is gained from the analogy of causes still in action, some powerful and sudden, others working slowly in the course of infinite ages.</div><div class="sentence"> Something too may be allowed to “the persistency of the strongest,” to “the survival of the fittest,” in this as in the other realms of nature.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">056</span> <div class="sentence">  These are some of the reflections which the modern philosophy of language suggests to us about the powers of the human mind and the forces and influences by which the efforts of men to utter articulate sounds were inspired.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet in making these and similar generalizations we may note also dangers to which we are exposed.</div><div class="sentence"> (1) There is the confusion of ideas with facts—of mere possibilities, and generalities, and modes of conception with actual and definite knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> The words “evolution,” “birth,” “law,” development,” “instinct,” “implicit,” “explicit,” and the like, have a false clearness or comprehensiveness, which adds nothing to our knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> The metaphor of a flower or a tree, or some other work of nature or art, is often in like manner only a pleasing picture.</div><div class="sentence"> (2) There is the fallacy of resolving the languages which we know into their parts, and then imagining that we can discover the nature of language by reconstructing them.</div><div class="sentence"> (3) There is the danger of identifying language, not with thoughts but with ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> (4) There is the error of supposing that the analysis of grammar and logic has always existed, or that their distinctions were familiar to Socrates and Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> (5) There is the fallacy of exaggerating, and also of diminishing the interval which separates articulate from inarticulate language—the cries of animals from the speech of man—the instincts of animals from the reason of man.</div><div class="sentence"> (6) There is the danger which besets all enquiries into the early history of man—of interpreting the past by the present, and of substituting the definite and intelligible for the true but dim outline which is the horizon of human knowledge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">057</span> <div class="sentence">  The greatest light is thrown upon the nature of language by analogy.</div><div class="sentence"> We have the analogy of the cries of animals, of the songs of birds (“man, like the nightingale, is a singing bird, but is ever binding up thoughts with musical notes”), of music, of children learning to speak, of barbarous nations in which the linguistic instinct is still undecayed, of ourselves learning to think and speak a new language, of the deaf and dumb who have words without sounds, of the various disorders of speech; and we have the after-growth of mythology, which, like language, is an unconscious creation of the human mind.</div><div class="sentence"> We can observe the social and collective instincts of animals, and may remark how, when domesticated, they have the power of understanding but not of speaking, while on the other hand, some birds which are comparatively devoid of intelligence, make a nearer approach to articulate speech.</div><div class="sentence"> We may note how in the animals there is a want of that sympathy with one another which appears to be the soul of language.</div><div class="sentence"> We can compare the use of speech with other mental and bodily operations; for speech too is a kind of gesture, and in the child or savage accompanied with gesture.</div><div class="sentence"> We may observe that the child learns to speak, as he learns to walk or to eat, by a natural impulse; yet in either case not without a power of imitation which is also natural to him—he is taught to read, but he breaks forth spontaneously in speech.</div><div class="sentence"> We can trace the impulse to bind together the world in ideas beginning in the first efforts to speak and culminating in philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> But there remains an element which cannot be explained, or even adequately described.</div><div class="sentence"> We can understand how man creates or constructs consciously and by design; and see, if we do not understand, how nature, by a law, calls into being an organised structure.</div><div class="sentence"> But the intermediate organism which stands between man and nature, which is the work of mind yet unconscious, and in which mind and matter seem to meet, and mind unperceived to herself is really limited by all other minds, is neither understood nor seen by us, and is with reluctance admitted to be a fact.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">058</span> <div class="sentence">  Language is an aspect of man, of nature, and of nations, the transfiguration of the world in thought, the meeting-point of the physical and mental sciences, and also the mirror in which they are reflected, present at every moment to the individual, and yet having a sort of eternal or universal nature.</div><div class="sentence"> When we analyze our own mental processes, we find words everywhere in every degree of clearness and consistency, fading away in dreams and more like pictures, rapidly succeeding one another in our waking thoughts, attaining a greater distinctness and consecutiveness in speech, and a greater still in writing, taking the place of one another when we try to become emancipated from their influence.</div><div class="sentence"> For in all processes of the mind which are conscious we are talking to ourselves; the attempt to think without words is a mere illusion,—they are always reappearing when we fix our thoughts.</div><div class="sentence"> And speech is not a separate faculty, but the expression of all our faculties, to which all our other powers of expression, signs, looks, gestures, lend their aid, of which the instrument is not the tongue only, but more than half the human frame.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">059</span> <div class="sentence">  The minds of men are sometimes carried on to think of their lives and of their actions as links in a chain of causes and effects going back to the beginning of time.</div><div class="sentence"> A few have seemed to lose the sense of their own individuality in the universal cause or nature.</div><div class="sentence"> In like manner we might think of the words which we daily use, as derived from the first speech of man, and of all the languages in the world, as the expressions or varieties of a single force or life of language of which the thoughts of men are the accident.</div><div class="sentence"> Such a conception enables us to grasp the power and wonder of languages, and is very natural to the scientific philologist.</div><div class="sentence"> For he, like the metaphysician, believes in the reality of that which absorbs his own mind.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor do we deny the enormous influence which language has exercised over thought.</div><div class="sentence"> Fixed words, like fixed ideas, have often governed the world.</div><div class="sentence"> But in such representations we attribute to language too much the nature of a cause, and too little of an effect,—too much of an absolute, too little of a relative character,—too much of an ideal, too little of a matter-of-fact existence.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">060</span> <div class="sentence">  Or again, we may frame a single abstract notion of language of which all existent languages may be supposed to be the perversion.</div><div class="sentence"> But we must not conceive that this logical figment had ever a real existence, or is anything more than an effort of the mind to give unity to infinitely various phenomena.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no abstract language “in rerum natura,” any more than there is an abstract tree, but only languages in various stages of growth, maturity, and decay.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor do other logical distinctions or even grammatical exactly correspond to the facts of language; for they too are attempts to give unity and regularity to a subject which is partly irregular.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">061</span> <div class="sentence">  We find, however, that there are distinctions of another kind by which this vast field of language admits of being mapped out.</div><div class="sentence"> There is the distinction between biliteral and triliteral roots, and the various inflexions which accompany them; between the mere mechanical cohesion of sounds or words, and the “chemical” combination of them into a new word; there is the distinction between languages which have had a free and full development of their organisms, and languages which have been stunted in their growth,—lamed in their hands or feet, and never able to acquire afterwards the powers in which they are deficient; there is the distinction between synthetical languages like Greek and Latin, which have retained their inflexions, and analytical languages like English or French, which have lost them.</div><div class="sentence"> Innumerable as are the languages and dialects of mankind, there are comparatively few classes to which they can be referred.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">062</span> <div class="sentence">  Another road through this chaos is provided by the physiology of speech.</div><div class="sentence"> The organs of language are the same in all mankind, and are only capable of uttering a certain number of sounds.</div><div class="sentence"> Every man has tongue, teeth, lips, palate, throat, mouth, which he may close or open, and adapt in various ways; making, first, vowels and consonants; and secondly, other classes of letters.</div><div class="sentence"> The elements of all speech, like the elements of the musical scale, are few and simple, though admitting of infinite gradations and combinations.</div><div class="sentence"> Whatever slight differences exist in the use or formation of these organs, owing to climate or the sense of euphony or other causes, they are as nothing compared with their agreement.</div><div class="sentence"> Here then is a real basis of unity in the study of philology, unlike that imaginary abstract unity of which we were just now speaking.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">063</span> <div class="sentence">  Whether we regard language from the psychological, or historical, or physiological point of view, the materials of our knowledge are inexhaustible.</div><div class="sentence"> The comparisons of children learning to speak, of barbarous nations, of musical notes, of the cries of animals, of the song of birds, increase our insight into the nature of human speech.</div><div class="sentence"> Many observations which would otherwise have escaped us are suggested by them.</div><div class="sentence"> But they do not explain why, in man and in man only, the speaker met with a response from the hearer, and the half articulate sound gradually developed into Sanscrit and Greek.</div><div class="sentence"> They hardly enable us to approach any nearer the secret of the origin of language, which, like some of the other great secrets of nature,—the origin of birth and death, or of animal life,—remains inviolable.</div><div class="sentence"> That problem is indissolubly bound up with the origin of man; and if we ever know more of the one, we may expect to know more of the other.</div><div class="sentence"> [1]</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">066</span> <div class="sentence">  (1) Language seems to be composite, but into its first elements the philologer has never been able to penetrate.</div><div class="sentence"> However far he goes back, he never arrives at the beginning; or rather, as in Geology or in Astronomy, there is no beginning.</div><div class="sentence"> He is too apt to suppose that by breaking up the existing forms of language into their parts he will arrive at a previous stage of it, but he is merely analyzing what never existed, or is never known to have existed, except in a composite form.</div><div class="sentence"> He may divide nouns and verbs into roots and inflexions, but he has no evidence which will show that the omega of tupto or the mu of tithemi, though analogous to ego, me, either became pronouns or were generated out of pronouns.</div><div class="sentence"> To say that “pronouns, like ripe fruit, dropped out of verbs,” is a misleading figure of speech.</div><div class="sentence"> Although all languages have some common principles, there is no primitive form or forms of language known to us, or to be reasonably imagined, from which they are all descended.</div><div class="sentence"> No inference can be drawn from language, either for or against the unity of the human race.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor is there any proof that words were ever used without any relation to each other.</div><div class="sentence"> Whatever may be the meaning of a sentence or a word when applied to primitive language, it is probable that the sentence is more akin to the original form than the word, and that the later stage of language is the result rather of analysis than of synthesis, or possibly is a combination of the two.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor, again, are we sure that the original process of learning to speak was the same in different places or among different races of men.</div><div class="sentence"> It may have been slower with some, quicker with others.</div><div class="sentence"> Some tribes may have used shorter, others longer words or cries: they may have been more or less inclined to agglutinate or to decompose them: they may have modified them by the use of prefixes, suffixes, infixes; by the lengthening and strengthening of vowels or by the shortening and weakening of them, by the condensation or rarefaction of consonants.</div><div class="sentence"> But who gave to language these primeval laws; or why one race has triliteral, another biliteral roots; or why in some members of a group of languages b becomes p, or d, t, or ch, k; or why two languages resemble one another in certain parts of their structure and differ in others; or why in one language there is a greater development of vowels, in another of consonants, and the like—are questions of which we only “entertain conjecture.” We must remember the length of time that has elapsed since man first walked upon the earth, and that in this vast but unknown period every variety of language may have been in process of formation and decay, many times over.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">094</span> <div class="sentence">  We can see clearly enough that letters or collocations of letters do by various degrees of strength or weakness, length or shortness, emphasis or pitch, become the natural expressions of the finer parts of human feeling or thought.</div><div class="sentence"> And not only so, but letters themselves have a significance; as Plato observes that the letter rho accent is expressive of motion, the letters delta and tau of binding and rest, the letter lambda of smoothness, nu of inwardness, the letter eta of length, the letter omicron of roundness.</div><div class="sentence"> These were often combined so as to form composite notions, as for example in tromos (trembling), trachus (rugged), thrauein (crush), krouein (strike), thruptein (break), pumbein (whirl),—in all which words we notice a parallel composition of sounds in their English equivalents.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato also remarks, as we remark, that the onomatopoetic principle is far from prevailing uniformly, and further that no explanation of language consistently corresponds with any system of philosophy, however great may be the light which language throws upon the nature of the mind.</div><div class="sentence"> Both in Greek and English we find groups of words such as string, swing, sling, spring, sting, which are parallel to one another and may be said to derive their vocal effect partly from contrast of letters, but in which it is impossible to assign a precise amount of meaning to each of the expressive and onomatopoetic letters.</div><div class="sentence"> A few of them are directly imitative, as for example the omega in oon, which represents the round form of the egg by the figure of the mouth: or bronte (thunder), in which the fulness of the sound of the word corresponds to the thing signified by it; or bombos (buzzing), of which the first syllable, as in its English equivalent, has the meaning of a deep sound.</div><div class="sentence"> We may observe also (as we see in the case of the poor stammerer) that speech has the co-operation of the whole body and may be often assisted or half expressed by gesticulation.</div><div class="sentence"> A sound or word is not the work of the vocal organs only; nearly the whole of the upper part of the human frame, including head, chest, lungs, have a share in creating it; and it may be accompanied by a movement of the eyes, nose, fingers, hands, feet which contributes to the effect of it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">095</span> <div class="sentence">  The principle of onomatopea has fallen into discredit, partly because it has been supposed to imply an actual manufacture of words out of syllables and letters, like a piece of joiner’s work,—a theory of language which is more and more refuted by facts, and more and more going out of fashion with philologians; and partly also because the traces of onomatopea in separate words become almost obliterated in the course of ages.</div><div class="sentence"> The poet of language cannot put in and pull out letters, as a painter might insert or blot out a shade of colour to give effect to his picture.</div><div class="sentence"> It would be ridiculous for him to alter any received form of a word in order to render it more expressive of the sense.</div><div class="sentence"> He can only select, perhaps out of some dialect, the form which is already best adapted to his purpose.</div><div class="sentence"> The true onomatopea is not a creative, but a formative principle, which in the later stage of the history of language ceases to act upon individual words; but still works through the collocation of them in the sentence or paragraph, and the adaptation of every word, syllable, letter to one another and to the rhythm of the whole passage.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">096</span> <div class="sentence">  iv.</div><div class="sentence"> Next, under a distinct head, although not separable from the preceding, may be considered the differentiation of languages, i.e.</div><div class="sentence"> the manner in which differences of meaning and form have arisen in them.</div><div class="sentence"> Into their first creation we have ceased to enquire: it is their aftergrowth with which we are now concerned.</div><div class="sentence"> How did the roots or substantial portions of words become modified or inflected?</div><div class="sentence"> and how did they receive separate meanings?</div><div class="sentence"> First we remark that words are attracted by the sounds and senses of other words, so that they form groups of nouns and verbs analogous in sound and sense to one another, each noun or verb putting forth inflexions, generally of two or three patterns, and with exceptions.</div><div class="sentence"> We do not say that we know how sense became first allied to sound; but we have no difficulty in ascertaining how the sounds and meanings of words were in time parted off or differentiated.</div><div class="sentence"> (1) The chief causes which regulate the variations of sound are (a) double or differing analogies, which lead sometimes to one form, sometimes to another (b) euphony, by which is meant chiefly the greater pleasure to the ear and the greater facility to the organs of speech which is given by a new formation or pronunciation of a word (c) the necessity of finding new expressions for new classes or processes of things.</div><div class="sentence"> We are told that changes of sound take place by innumerable gradations until a whole tribe or community or society find themselves acquiescing in a new pronunciation or use of language.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet no one observes the change, or is at all aware that in the course of a lifetime he and his contemporaries have appreciably varied their intonation or use of words.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, the necessities of language seem to require that the intermediate sounds or meanings of words should quickly become fixed or set and not continue in a state of transition.</div><div class="sentence"> The process of settling down is aided by the organs of speech and by the use of writing and printing.</div><div class="sentence"> (2) The meaning of words varies because ideas vary or the number of things which is included under them or with which they are associated is increased.</div><div class="sentence"> A single word is thus made to do duty for many more things than were formerly expressed by it; and it parts into different senses when the classes of things or ideas which are represented by it are themselves different and distinct.</div><div class="sentence"> A figurative use of a word may easily pass into a new sense: a new meaning caught up by association may become more important than all the rest.</div><div class="sentence"> The good or neutral sense of a word, such as Jesuit, Puritan, Methodist, Heretic, has been often converted into a bad one by the malevolence of party spirit.</div><div class="sentence"> Double forms suggest different meanings and are often used to express them; and the form or accent of a word has been not unfrequently altered when there is a difference of meaning.</div><div class="sentence"> The difference of gender in nouns is utilized for the same reason.</div><div class="sentence"> New meanings of words push themselves into the vacant spaces of language and retire when they are no longer needed.</div><div class="sentence"> Language equally abhors vacancy and superfluity.</div><div class="sentence"> But the remedial measures by which both are eliminated are not due to any conscious action of the human mind; nor is the force exerted by them constraining or necessary.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">097</span> <div class="sentence">  (7) We have shown that language, although subject to laws, is far from being of an exact and uniform nature.</div><div class="sentence"> We may now speak briefly of the faults of language.</div><div class="sentence"> They may be compared to the faults of Geology, in which different strata cross one another or meet at an angle, or mix with one another either by slow transitions or by violent convulsions, leaving many lacunae which can be no longer filled up, and often becoming so complex that no true explanation of them can be given.</div><div class="sentence"> So in language there are the cross influences of meaning and sound, of logic and grammar, of differing analogies, of words and the inflexions of words, which often come into conflict with each other.</div><div class="sentence"> The grammarian, if he were to form new words, would make them all of the same pattern according to what he conceives to be the rule, that is, the more common usage of language.</div><div class="sentence"> The subtlety of nature goes far beyond art, and it is complicated by irregularity, so that often we can hardly say that there is a right or wrong in the formation of words.</div><div class="sentence"> For almost any formation which is not at variance with the first principles of language is possible and may be defended.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">098</span> <div class="sentence">  The imperfection of language is really due to the formation and correlation of words by accident, that is to say, by principles which are unknown to us.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence we see why Plato, like ourselves unable to comprehend the whole of language, was constrained to “supplement the poor creature imitation by another poor creature convention.” But the poor creature convention in the end proves too much for all the rest: for we do not ask what is the origin of words or whether they are formed according to a correct analogy, but what is the usage of them; and we are compelled to admit with Hermogenes in Plato and with Horace that usage is the ruling principle, “quem penes arbitrium est, et jus et norma loquendi.”</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">099</span> <div class="sentence">  (8) There are two ways in which a language may attain permanence or fixity.</div><div class="sentence"> First, it may have been embodied in poems or hymns or laws, which may be repeated for hundreds, perhaps for thousands of years with a religious accuracy, so that to the priests or rhapsodists of a nation the whole or the greater part of a language is literally preserved; secondly, it may be written down and in a written form distributed more or less widely among the whole nation.</div><div class="sentence"> In either case the language which is familiarly spoken may have grown up wholly or in a great measure independently of them.</div><div class="sentence"> (1) The first of these processes has been sometimes attended by the result that the sound of the words has been carefully preserved and that the meaning of them has either perished wholly, or is only doubtfully recovered by the efforts of modern philology.</div><div class="sentence"> The verses have been repeated as a chant or part of a ritual, but they have had no relation to ordinary life or speech.</div><div class="sentence"> (2) The invention of writing again is commonly attributed to a particular epoch, and we are apt to think that such an inestimable gift would have immediately been diffused over a whole country.</div><div class="sentence"> But it may have taken a long time to perfect the art of writing, and another long period may have elapsed before it came into common use.</div><div class="sentence"> Its influence on language has been increased ten, twenty or one hundred fold by the invention of printing.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">100</span> <div class="sentence">  Before the growth of poetry or the invention of writing, languages were only dialects.</div><div class="sentence"> So they continued to be in parts of the country in which writing was not used or in which there was no diffusion of literature.</div><div class="sentence"> In most of the counties of England there is still a provincial style, which has been sometimes made by a great poet the vehicle of his fancies.</div><div class="sentence"> When a book sinks into the mind of a nation, such as Luther’s Bible or the Authorized English Translation of the Bible, or again great classical works like Shakspere or Milton, not only have new powers of expression been diffused through a whole nation, but a great step towards uniformity has been made.</div><div class="sentence"> The instinct of language demands regular grammar and correct spelling: these are imprinted deeply on the tablets of a nation’s memory by a common use of classical and popular writers.</div><div class="sentence"> In our own day we have attained to a point at which nearly every printed book is spelt correctly and written grammatically.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">101</span> <div class="sentence">  (9) Proceeding further to trace the influence of literature on language we note some other causes which have affected the higher use of it: such as (1) the necessity of clearness and connexion; (2) the fear of tautology; (3) the influence of metre, rhythm, rhyme, and of the language of prose and verse upon one another; (4) the power of idiom and quotation; (5) the relativeness of words to one another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">102</span> <div class="sentence">  It has been usual to depreciate modern languages when compared with ancient.</div><div class="sentence"> The latter are regarded as furnishing a type of excellence to which the former cannot attain.</div><div class="sentence"> But the truth seems to be that modern languages, if through the loss of inflections and genders they lack some power or beauty or expressiveness or precision which is possessed by the ancient, are in many other respects superior to them: the thought is generally clearer, the connexion closer, the sentence and paragraph are better distributed.</div><div class="sentence"> The best modern languages, for example English or French, possess as great a power of self-improvement as the Latin, if not as the Greek.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor does there seem to be any reason why they should ever decline or decay.</div><div class="sentence"> It is a popular remark that our great writers are beginning to disappear: it may also be remarked that whenever a great writer appears in the future he will find the English language as perfect and as ready for use as in the days of Shakspere or Milton.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no reason to suppose that English or French will ever be reduced to the low level of Modern Greek or of Mediaeval Latin.</div><div class="sentence"> The wide diffusion of great authors would make such a decline impossible.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor will modern languages be easily broken up by amalgamation with each other.</div><div class="sentence"> The distance between them is too wide to be spanned, the differences are too great to be overcome, and the use of printing makes it impossible that one of them should ever be lost in another.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">103</span> <div class="sentence">  The structure of the English language differs greatly from that of either Latin or Greek.</div><div class="sentence"> In the two latter, especially in Greek, sentences are joined together by connecting particles.</div><div class="sentence"> They are distributed on the right hand and on the left by men, de, alla, kaitoi, kai de and the like, or deduced from one another by ara, de, oun, toinun and the like.</div><div class="sentence"> In English the majority of sentences are independent and in apposition to one another; they are laid side by side or slightly connected by the copula.</div><div class="sentence"> But within the sentence the expression of the logical relations of the clauses is closer and more exact: there is less of apposition and participial structure.</div><div class="sentence"> The sentences thus laid side by side are also constructed into paragraphs; these again are less distinctly marked in Greek and Latin than in English.</div><div class="sentence"> Generally French, German, and English have an advantage over the classical languages in point of accuracy.</div><div class="sentence"> The three concords are more accurately observed in English than in either Greek or Latin.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, the extension of the familiar use of the masculine and feminine gender to objects of sense and abstract ideas as well as to men and animals no doubt lends a nameless grace to style which we have a difficulty in appreciating, and the possible variety in the order of words gives more flexibility and also a kind of dignity to the period.</div><div class="sentence"> Of the comparative effect of accent and quantity and of the relation between them in ancient and modern languages we are not able to judge.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">104</span> <div class="sentence">  Another quality in which modern are superior to ancient languages is freedom from tautology.</div><div class="sentence"> No English style is thought tolerable in which, except for the sake of emphasis, the same words are repeated at short intervals.</div><div class="sentence"> Of course the length of the interval must depend on the character of the word.</div><div class="sentence"> Striking words and expressions cannot be allowed to reappear, if at all, except at the distance of a page or more.</div><div class="sentence"> Pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions may or rather must recur in successive lines.</div><div class="sentence"> It seems to be a kind of impertinence to the reader and strikes unpleasantly both on the mind and on the ear that the same sounds should be used twice over, when another word or turn of expression would have given a new shade of meaning to the thought and would have added a pleasing variety to the sound.</div><div class="sentence"> And the mind equally rejects the repetition of the word and the use of a mere synonym for it,—e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> felicity and happiness.</div><div class="sentence"> The cultivated mind desires something more, which a skilful writer is easily able to supply out of his treasure-house.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">105</span> <div class="sentence">  The fear of tautology has doubtless led to the multiplications of words and the meanings of words, and generally to an enlargement of the vocabulary.</div><div class="sentence"> It is a very early instinct of language; for ancient poetry is almost as free from tautology as the best modern writings.</div><div class="sentence"> The speech of young children, except in so far as they are compelled to repeat themselves by the fewness of their words, also escapes from it.</div><div class="sentence"> When they grow up and have ideas which are beyond their powers of expression, especially in writing, tautology begins to appear.</div><div class="sentence"> In like manner when language is “contaminated” by philosophy it is apt to become awkward, to stammer and repeat itself, to lose its flow and freedom.</div><div class="sentence"> No philosophical writer with the exception of Plato, who is himself not free from tautology, and perhaps Bacon, has attained to any high degree of literary excellence.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">106</span> <div class="sentence">  To poetry the form and polish of language is chiefly to be attributed; and the most critical period in the history of language is the transition from verse to prose.</div><div class="sentence"> At first mankind were contented to express their thoughts in a set form of words having a kind of rhythm; to which regularity was given by accent and quantity.</div><div class="sentence"> But after a time they demanded a greater degree of freedom, and to those who had all their life been hearing poetry the first introduction of prose had the charm of novelty.</div><div class="sentence"> The prose romances into which the Homeric Poems were converted, for a while probably gave more delight to the hearers or readers of them than the Poems themselves, and in time the relation of the two was reversed: the poems which had once been a necessity of the human mind became a luxury: they were now superseded by prose, which in all succeeding ages became the natural vehicle of expression to all mankind.</div><div class="sentence"> Henceforward prose and poetry formed each other.</div><div class="sentence"> A comparatively slender link between them was also furnished by proverbs.</div><div class="sentence"> We may trace in poetry how the simple succession of lines, not without monotony, has passed into a complicated period, and how in prose, rhythm and accent and the order of words and the balance of clauses, sometimes not without a slight admixture of rhyme, make up a new kind of harmony, swelling into strains not less majestic than those of Homer, Virgil, or Dante.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">107</span> <div class="sentence">  One of the most curious and characteristic features of language, affecting both syntax and style, is idiom.</div><div class="sentence"> The meaning of the word “idiom” is that which is peculiar, that which is familiar, the word or expression which strikes us or comes home to us, which is more readily understood or more easily remembered.</div><div class="sentence"> It is a quality which really exists in infinite degrees, which we turn into differences of kind by applying the term only to conspicuous and striking examples of words or phrases which have this quality.</div><div class="sentence"> It often supersedes the laws of language or the rules of grammar, or rather is to be regarded as another law of language which is natural and necessary.</div><div class="sentence"> The word or phrase which has been repeated many times over is more intelligible and familiar to us than one which is rare, and our familiarity with it more than compensates for incorrectness or inaccuracy in the use of it.</div><div class="sentence"> Striking expressions also which have moved the hearts of nations or are the precious stones and jewels of great authors partake of the nature of idioms: they are taken out of the sphere of grammar and are exempt from the proprieties of language.</div><div class="sentence"> Every one knows that we often put words together in a manner which would be intolerable if it were not idiomatic.</div><div class="sentence"> We cannot argue either about the meaning of words or the use of constructions that because they are used in one connexion they will be legitimate in another, unless we allow for this principle.</div><div class="sentence"> We can bear to have words and sentences used in new senses or in a new order or even a little perverted in meaning when we are quite familiar with them.</div><div class="sentence"> Quotations are as often applied in a sense which the author did not intend as in that which he did.</div><div class="sentence"> The parody of the words of Shakspere or of the Bible, which has in it something of the nature of a lie, is far from unpleasing to us.</div><div class="sentence"> The better known words, even if their meaning be perverted, are more agreeable to us and have a greater power over us.</div><div class="sentence"> Most of us have experienced a sort of delight and feeling of curiosity when we first came across or when we first used for ourselves a new word or phrase or figure of speech.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">108</span> <div class="sentence">  There are associations of sound and of sense by which every word is linked to every other.</div><div class="sentence"> One letter harmonizes with another; every verb or noun derives its meaning, not only from itself, but from the words with which it is associated.</div><div class="sentence"> Some reflection of them near or distant is embodied in it.</div><div class="sentence"> In any new use of a word all the existing uses of it have to be considered.</div><div class="sentence"> Upon these depends the question whether it will bear the proposed extension of meaning or not.</div><div class="sentence"> According to the famous expression of Luther, “Words are living creatures, having hands and feet.” When they cease to retain this living power of adaptation, when they are only put together like the parts of a piece of furniture, language becomes unpoetical, inexpressive, dead.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">109</span> <div class="sentence">  Grammars would lead us to suppose that words have a fixed form and sound.</div><div class="sentence"> Lexicons assign to each word a definite meaning or meanings.</div><div class="sentence"> They both tend to obscure the fact that the sentence precedes the word and that all language is relative.</div><div class="sentence"> (1) It is relative to its own context.</div><div class="sentence"> Its meaning is modified by what has been said before and after in the same or in some other passage: without comparing the context we are not sure whether it is used in the same sense even in two successive sentences.</div><div class="sentence"> (2) It is relative to facts, to time, place, and occasion: when they are already known to the hearer or reader, they may be presupposed; there is no need to allude to them further.</div><div class="sentence"> (3) It is relative to the knowledge of the writer and reader or of the speaker and hearer.</div><div class="sentence"> Except for the sake of order and consecutiveness nothing ought to be expressed which is already commonly or universally known.</div><div class="sentence"> A word or two may be sufficient to give an intimation to a friend; a long or elaborate speech or composition is required to explain some new idea to a popular audience or to the ordinary reader or to a young pupil.</div><div class="sentence"> Grammars and dictionaries are not to be despised; for in teaching we need clearness rather than subtlety.</div><div class="sentence"> But we must not therefore forget that there is also a higher ideal of language in which all is relative—sounds to sounds, words to words, the parts to the whole—in which besides the lesser context of the book or speech, there is also the larger context of history and circumstances.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">110</span> <div class="sentence">  The study of Comparative Philology has introduced into the world a new science which more than any other binds up man with nature, and distant ages and countries with one another.</div><div class="sentence"> It may be said to have thrown a light upon all other sciences and upon the nature of the human mind itself.</div><div class="sentence"> The true conception of it dispels many errors, not only of metaphysics and theology, but also of natural knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet it is far from certain that this newly-found science will continue to progress in the same surprising manner as heretofore; or that even if our materials are largely increased, we shall arrive at much more definite conclusions than at present.</div><div class="sentence"> Like some other branches of knowledge, it may be approaching a point at which it can no longer be profitably studied.</div><div class="sentence"> But at any rate it has brought back the philosophy of language from theory to fact; it has passed out of the region of guesses and hypotheses, and has attained the dignity of an Inductive Science.</div><div class="sentence"> And it is not without practical and political importance.</div><div class="sentence"> It gives a new interest to distant and subject countries; it brings back the dawning light from one end of the earth to the other.</div><div class="sentence"> Nations, like individuals, are better understood by us when we know something of their early life; and when they are better understood by us, we feel more kindly towards them.</div><div class="sentence"> Lastly, we may remember that all knowledge is valuable for its own sake; and we may also hope that a deeper insight into the nature of human speech will give us a greater command of it and enable us to make a nobler use of it.</div><div class="sentence"> [2]</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">005</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Son of Hipponicus, there is an ancient saying, that “hard is the knowledge of the good.” And the knowledge of names is a great part of knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> If I had not been poor, I might have heard the fifty-drachma course of the great Prodicus, which is a complete education in grammar and language—these are his own words—and then I should have been at once able to answer your question about the correctness of names.</div><div class="sentence"> But, indeed, I have only heard the single-drachma course, and therefore, I do not know the truth about such matters; I will, however, gladly assist you and Cratylus in the investigation of them.</div><div class="sentence"> When he declares that your name is not really Hermogenes, I suspect that he is only making fun of you;—he means to say that you are no true son of Hermes, because you are always looking after a fortune and never in luck.</div><div class="sentence"> But, as I was saying, there is a good deal of difficulty in this sort of knowledge, and therefore we had better leave the question open until we have heard both sides.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">006</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  I have often talked over this matter, both with Cratylus and others, and cannot convince myself that there is any principle of correctness in names other than convention and agreement; any name which you give, in my opinion, is the right one, and if you change that and give another, the new name is as correct as the old—we frequently change the names of our slaves, and the newly-imposed name is as good as the old:  for there is no name given to anything by nature; all is convention and habit of the users;—such is my view.</div><div class="sentence"> But if I am mistaken I shall be happy to hear and learn of Cratylus, or of any one else.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">007</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I dare say that you may be right, Hermogenes:  let us see;—Your meaning is, that the name of each thing is only that which anybody agrees to call it?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">039</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But would you say, Hermogenes, that the things differ as the names differ?</div><div class="sentence"> and are they relative to individuals, as Protagoras tells us?</div><div class="sentence"> For he says that man is the measure of all things, and that things are to me as they appear to me, and that they are to you as they appear to you.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you agree with him, or would you say that things have a permanent essence of their own?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">235</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  With all my heart; for am very curious to hear the rest of the enquiry about names.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">236</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then let us proceed; and where would you have us begin, now that we have got a sort of outline of the enquiry?</div><div class="sentence"> Are there any names which witness of themselves that they are not given arbitrarily, but have a natural fitness?</div><div class="sentence"> The names of heroes and of men in general are apt to be deceptive because they are often called after ancestors with whose names, as we were saying, they may have no business; or they are the expression of a wish like Eutychides (the son of good fortune), or Sosias (the Saviour), or Theophilus (the beloved of God), and others.</div><div class="sentence"> But I think that we had better leave these, for there will be more chance of finding correctness in the names of immutable essences;—there ought to have been more care taken about them when they were named, and perhaps there may have been some more than human power at work occasionally in giving them names.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">237</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  I think so, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">238</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Ought we not to begin with the consideration of the Gods, and show that they are rightly named Gods?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">240</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  My notion would be something of this sort: —I suspect that the sun, moon, earth, stars, and heaven, which are still the Gods of many barbarians, were the only Gods known to the aboriginal Hellenes.</div><div class="sentence"> Seeing that they were always moving and running, from their running nature they were called Gods or runners (Theous, Theontas); and when men became acquainted with the other Gods, they proceeded to apply the same name to them all.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you think that likely?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">241</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  I think it very likely indeed.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">245</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Let me hear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">246</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You know how Hesiod uses the word?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">248</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do you not remember that he speaks of a golden race of men who came first?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">250</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  He says of them—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">251</span> <div class="sentence">  “But now that fate has closed over this race They are holy demons upon the earth, Beneficent, averters of ills, guardians of mortal men.” (Hesiod, Works and Days.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">252</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  What is the inference?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">253</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What is the inference!</div><div class="sentence"> Why, I suppose that he means by the golden men, not men literally made of gold, but good and noble; and I am convinced of this, because he further says that we are the iron race.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">254</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  That is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">255</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do you not suppose that good men of our own day would by him be said to be of golden race?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">256</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Very likely.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">257</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And are not the good wise?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">258</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, they are wise.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">259</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And therefore I have the most entire conviction that he called them demons, because they were daemones (knowing or wise), and in our older Attic dialect the word itself occurs.</div><div class="sentence"> Now he and other poets say truly, that when a good man dies he has honour and a mighty portion among the dead, and becomes a demon; which is a name given to him signifying wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> And I say too, that every wise man who happens to be a good man is more than human (daimonion) both in life and death, and is rightly called a demon.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">260</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Then I rather think that I am of one mind with you; but what is the meaning of the word “hero”?</div><div class="sentence"> (Eros with an eta, in the old writing eros with an epsilon.)</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">261</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I think that there is no difficulty in explaining, for the name is not much altered, and signifies that they were born of love.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">262</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">263</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do you not know that the heroes are demigods?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">264</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  What then?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">265</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  All of them sprang either from the love of a God for a mortal woman, or of a mortal man for a Goddess; think of the word in the old Attic, and you will see better that the name heros is only a slight alteration of Eros, from whom the heroes sprang:  either this is the meaning, or, if not this, then they must have been skilful as rhetoricians and dialecticians, and able to put the question (erotan), for eirein is equivalent to legein.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore, as I was saying, in the Attic dialect the heroes turn out to be rhetoricians and questioners.</div><div class="sentence"> All this is easy enough; the noble breed of heroes are a tribe of sophists and rhetors.</div><div class="sentence"> But can you tell me why men are called anthropoi?—that is more difficult.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">266</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  No, I cannot; and I would not try even if I could, because I think that you are the more likely to succeed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">267</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That is to say, you trust to the inspiration of Euthyphro.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">268</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">269</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Your faith is not vain; for at this very moment a new and ingenious thought strikes me, and, if I am not careful, before to-morrow’s dawn I shall be wiser than I ought to be.</div><div class="sentence"> Now, attend to me; and first, remember that we often put in and pull out letters in words, and give names as we please and change the accents.</div><div class="sentence"> Take, for example, the word Dii Philos; in order to convert this from a sentence into a noun, we omit one of the iotas and sound the middle syllable grave instead of acute; as, on the other hand, letters are sometimes inserted in words instead of being omitted, and the acute takes the place of the grave.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">270</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  That is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">271</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The name anthropos, which was once a sentence, and is now a noun, appears to be a case just of this sort, for one letter, which is the alpha, has been omitted, and the acute on the last syllable has been changed to a grave.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">272</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">273</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I mean to say that the word “man” implies that other animals never examine, or consider, or look up at what they see, but that man not only sees (opope) but considers and looks up at that which he sees, and hence he alone of all animals is rightly anthropos, meaning anathron a opopen.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">274</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  May I ask you to examine another word about which I am curious?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">275</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">276</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  I will take that which appears to me to follow next in order.</div><div class="sentence"> You know the distinction of soul and body?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">277</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Of course.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">278</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us endeavour to analyze them like the previous words.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">279</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You want me first of all to examine the natural fitness of the word psuche (soul), and then of the word soma (body)?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">280</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">281</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  If I am to say what occurs to me at the moment, I should imagine that those who first used the name psuche meant to express that the soul when in the body is the source of life, and gives the power of breath and revival (anapsuchon), and when this reviving power fails then the body perishes and dies, and this, if I am not mistaken, they called psyche.</div><div class="sentence"> But please stay a moment; I fancy that I can discover something which will be more acceptable to the disciples of Euthyphro, for I am afraid that they will scorn this explanation.</div><div class="sentence"> What do you say to another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">282</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Let me hear.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">283</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What is that which holds and carries and gives life and motion to the entire nature of the body?</div><div class="sentence"> What else but the soul?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">284</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Just that.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">285</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do you not believe with Anaxagoras, that mind or soul is the ordering and containing principle of all things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">286</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; I do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">287</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then you may well call that power phuseche which carries and holds nature (e phusin okei, kai ekei), and this may be refined away into psuche.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">288</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly; and this derivation is, I think, more scientific than the other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">289</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  It is so; but I cannot help laughing, if I am to suppose that this was the true meaning of the name.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">290</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  But what shall we say of the next word?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">291</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You mean soma (the body).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">292</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">293</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That may be variously interpreted; and yet more variously if a little permutation is allowed.</div><div class="sentence"> For some say that the body is the grave (sema) of the soul which may be thought to be buried in our present life; or again the index of the soul, because the soul gives indications to (semainei) the body; probably the Orphic poets were the inventors of the name, and they were under the impression that the soul is suffering the punishment of sin, and that the body is an enclosure or prison in which the soul is incarcerated, kept safe (soma, sozetai), as the name soma implies, until the penalty is paid; according to this view, not even a letter of the word need be changed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">294</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  I think, Socrates, that we have said enough of this class of words.</div><div class="sentence"> But have we any more explanations of the names of the Gods, like that which you were giving of Zeus?</div><div class="sentence"> I should like to know whether any similar principle of correctness is to be applied to them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">295</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, indeed, Hermogenes; and there is one excellent principle which, as men of sense, we must acknowledge,—that of the Gods we know nothing, either of their natures or of the names which they give themselves; but we are sure that the names by which they call themselves, whatever they may be, are true.</div><div class="sentence"> And this is the best of all principles; and the next best is to say, as in prayers, that we will call them by any sort or kind of names or patronymics which they like, because we do not know of any other.</div><div class="sentence"> That also, I think, is a very good custom, and one which I should much wish to observe.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us, then, if you please, in the first place announce to them that we are not enquiring about them; we do not presume that we are able to do so; but we are enquiring about the meaning of men in giving them these names,—in this there can be small blame.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">296</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  I think, Socrates, that you are quite right, and I would like to do as you say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">297</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Shall we begin, then, with Hestia, according to custom?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">298</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, that will be very proper.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">299</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What may we suppose him to have meant who gave the name Hestia?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">300</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  That is another and certainly a most difficult question.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">301</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  My dear Hermogenes, the first imposers of names must surely have been considerable persons; they were philosophers, and had a good deal to say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">302</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, and what of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">303</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  They are the men to whom I should attribute the imposition of names.</div><div class="sentence"> Even in foreign names, if you analyze them, a meaning is still discernible.</div><div class="sentence"> For example, that which we term ousia is by some called esia, and by others again osia.</div><div class="sentence"> Now that the essence of things should be called estia, which is akin to the first of these (esia = estia), is rational enough.</div><div class="sentence"> And there is reason in the Athenians calling that estia which participates in ousia.</div><div class="sentence"> For in ancient times we too seem to have said esia for ousia, and this you may note to have been the idea of those who appointed that sacrifices should be first offered to estia, which was natural enough if they meant that estia was the essence of things.</div><div class="sentence"> Those again who read osia seem to have inclined to the opinion of Heracleitus, that all things flow and nothing stands; with them the pushing principle (othoun) is the cause and ruling power of all things, and is therefore rightly called osia.</div><div class="sentence"> Enough of this, which is all that we who know nothing can affirm.</div><div class="sentence"> Next in order after Hestia we ought to consider Rhea and Cronos, although the name of Cronos has been already discussed.</div><div class="sentence"> But I dare say that I am talking great nonsense.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">304</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">305</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  My good friend, I have discovered a hive of wisdom.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">306</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Of what nature?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">307</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, rather ridiculous, and yet plausible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">308</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  How plausible?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">309</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I fancy to myself Heracleitus repeating wise traditions of antiquity as old as the days of Cronos and Rhea, and of which Homer also spoke.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">310</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  How do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">311</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Heracleitus is supposed to say that all things are in motion and nothing at rest; he compares them to the stream of a river, and says that you cannot go into the same water twice.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">312</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  That is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">313</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, how can we avoid inferring that he who gave the names of Cronos and Rhea to the ancestors of the Gods, agreed pretty much in the doctrine of Heracleitus?</div><div class="sentence"> Is the giving of the names of streams to both of them purely accidental?</div><div class="sentence"> Compare the line in which Homer, and, as I believe, Hesiod also, tells of</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">314</span> <div class="sentence">  “Ocean, the origin of Gods, and mother Tethys (Il.—the line is not found in the extant works of Hesiod.</div><div class="sentence"> ).”</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">315</span> <div class="sentence">  And again, Orpheus says, that</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">316</span> <div class="sentence">  “The fair river of Ocean was the first to marry, and he espoused his sister Tethys, who was his mother’s daughter.”</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">317</span> <div class="sentence">  You see that this is a remarkable coincidence, and all in the direction of Heracleitus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">318</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  I think that there is something in what you say, Socrates; but I do not understand the meaning of the name Tethys.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">319</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, that is almost self-explained, being only the name of a spring, a little disguised; for that which is strained and filtered (diattomenon, ethoumenon) may be likened to a spring, and the name Tethys is made up of these two words.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">320</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  The idea is ingenious, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">321</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  To be sure.</div><div class="sentence"> But what comes next?—of Zeus we have spoken.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">322</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">323</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then let us next take his two brothers, Poseidon and Pluto, whether the latter is called by that or by his other name.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">324</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  By all means.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">325</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Poseidon is Posidesmos, the chain of the feet; the original inventor of the name had been stopped by the watery element in his walks, and not allowed to go on, and therefore he called the ruler of this element Poseidon; the epsilon was probably inserted as an ornament.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet, perhaps, not so; but the name may have been originally written with a double lamda and not with a sigma, meaning that the God knew many things (Polla eidos).</div><div class="sentence"> And perhaps also he being the shaker of the earth, has been named from shaking (seiein), and then pi and delta have been added.</div><div class="sentence"> Pluto gives wealth (Ploutos), and his name means the giver of wealth, which comes out of the earth beneath.</div><div class="sentence"> People in general appear to imagine that the term Hades is connected with the invisible (aeides) and so they are led by their fears to call the God Pluto instead.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">326</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  And what is the true derivation?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">327</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In spite of the mistakes which are made about the power of this deity, and the foolish fears which people have of him, such as the fear of always being with him after death, and of the soul denuded of the body going to him (compare Rep.), my belief is that all is quite consistent, and that the office and name of the God really correspond.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">328</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, how is that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">329</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I will tell you my own opinion; but first, I should like to ask you which chain does any animal feel to be the stronger?</div><div class="sentence"> and which confines him more to the same spot,—desire or necessity?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">330</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Desire, Socrates, is stronger far.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">331</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And do you not think that many a one would escape from Hades, if he did not bind those who depart to him by the strongest of chains?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">333</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if by the greatest of chains, then by some desire, as I should certainly infer, and not by necessity?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">435</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  By the dog of Egypt I have a not bad notion which came into my head only this moment:  I believe that the primeval givers of names were undoubtedly like too many of our modern philosophers, who, in their search after the nature of things, are always getting dizzy from constantly going round and round, and then they imagine that the world is going round and round and moving in all directions; and this appearance, which arises out of their own internal condition, they suppose to be a reality of nature; they think that there is nothing stable or permanent, but only flux and motion, and that the world is always full of every sort of motion and change.</div><div class="sentence"> The consideration of the names which I mentioned has led me into making this reflection.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">436</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  How is that, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">437</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Perhaps you did not observe that in the names which have been just cited, the motion or flux or generation of things is most surely indicated.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">438</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  No, indeed, I never thought of it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">439</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Take the first of those which you mentioned; clearly that is a name indicative of motion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">440</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  What was the name?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">441</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Phronesis (wisdom), which may signify phoras kai rhou noesis (perception of motion and flux), or perhaps phoras onesis (the blessing of motion), but is at any rate connected with pheresthai (motion); gnome (judgment), again, certainly implies the ponderation or consideration (nomesis) of generation, for to ponder is the same as to consider; or, if you would rather, here is noesis, the very word just now mentioned, which is neou esis (the desire of the new); the word neos implies that the world is always in process of creation.</div><div class="sentence"> The giver of the name wanted to express this longing of the soul, for the original name was neoesis, and not noesis; but eta took the place of a double epsilon.</div><div class="sentence"> The word sophrosune is the salvation (soteria) of that wisdom (phronesis) which we were just now considering.</div><div class="sentence"> Epioteme (knowledge) is akin to this, and indicates that the soul which is good for anything follows (epetai) the motion of things, neither anticipating them nor falling behind them; wherefore the word should rather be read as epistemene, inserting epsilon nu.</div><div class="sentence"> Sunesis (understanding) may be regarded in like manner as a kind of conclusion; the word is derived from sunienai (to go along with), and, like epistasthai (to know), implies the progression of the soul in company with the nature of things.</div><div class="sentence"> Sophia (wisdom) is very dark, and appears not to be of native growth; the meaning is, touching the motion or stream of things.</div><div class="sentence"> You must remember that the poets, when they speak of the commencement of any rapid motion, often use the word esuthe (he rushed); and there was a famous Lacedaemonian who was named Sous (Rush), for by this word the Lacedaemonians signify rapid motion, and the touching (epaphe) of motion is expressed by sophia, for all things are supposed to be in motion.</div><div class="sentence"> Good (agathon) is the name which is given to the admirable (agasto) in nature; for, although all things move, still there are degrees of motion; some are swifter, some slower; but there are some things which are admirable for their swiftness, and this admirable part of nature is called agathon.</div><div class="sentence"> Dikaiosune (justice) is clearly dikaiou sunesis (understanding of the just); but the actual word dikaion is more difficult:  men are only agreed to a certain extent about justice, and then they begin to disagree.</div><div class="sentence"> For those who suppose all things to be in motion conceive the greater part of nature to be a mere receptacle; and they say that there is a penetrating power which passes through all this, and is the instrument of creation in all, and is the subtlest and swiftest element; for if it were not the subtlest, and a power which none can keep out, and also the swiftest, passing by other things as if they were standing still, it could not penetrate through the moving universe.</div><div class="sentence"> And this element, which superintends all things and pierces (diaion) all, is rightly called dikaion; the letter k is only added for the sake of euphony.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus far, as I was saying, there is a general agreement about the nature of justice; but I, Hermogenes, being an enthusiastic disciple, have been told in a mystery that the justice of which I am speaking is also the cause of the world:  now a cause is that because of which anything is created; and some one comes and whispers in my ear that justice is rightly so called because partaking of the nature of the cause, and I begin, after hearing what he has said, to interrogate him gently:  “Well, my excellent friend,” say I, “but if all this be true, I still want to know what is justice.” Thereupon they think that I ask tiresome questions, and am leaping over the barriers, and have been already sufficiently answered, and they try to satisfy me with one derivation after another, and at length they quarrel.</div><div class="sentence"> For one of them says that justice is the sun, and that he only is the piercing (diaionta) and burning (kaonta) element which is the guardian of nature.</div><div class="sentence"> And when I joyfully repeat this beautiful notion, I am answered by the satirical remark, “What, is there no justice in the world when the sun is down?” And when I earnestly beg my questioner to tell me his own honest opinion, he says, “Fire in the abstract”; but this is not very intelligible.</div><div class="sentence"> Another says, “No, not fire in the abstract, but the abstraction of heat in the fire.” Another man professes to laugh at all this, and says, as Anaxagoras says, that justice is mind, for mind, as they say, has absolute power, and mixes with nothing, and orders all things, and passes through all things.</div><div class="sentence"> At last, my friend, I find myself in far greater perplexity about the nature of justice than I was before I began to learn.</div><div class="sentence"> But still I am of opinion that the name, which has led me into this digression, was given to justice for the reasons which I have mentioned.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">442</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  I think, Socrates, that you are not improvising now; you must have heard this from some one else.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">446</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  That is surely probable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">447</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; and the very word thallein (to flourish) seems to figure the growth of youth, which is swift and sudden ever.</div><div class="sentence"> And this is expressed by the legislator in the name, which is a compound of thein (running), and allesthai (leaping).</div><div class="sentence"> Pray observe how I gallop away when I get on smooth ground.</div><div class="sentence"> There are a good many names generally thought to be of importance, which have still to be explained.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">453</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, my dear friend; but then you know that the original names have been long ago buried and disguised by people sticking on and stripping off letters for the sake of euphony, and twisting and bedizening them in all sorts of ways:  and time too may have had a share in the change.</div><div class="sentence"> Take, for example, the word katoptron; why is the letter rho inserted?</div><div class="sentence"> This must surely be the addition of some one who cares nothing about the truth, but thinks only of putting the mouth into shape.</div><div class="sentence"> And the additions are often such that at last no human being can possibly make out the original meaning of the word.</div><div class="sentence"> Another example is the word sphigx, sphiggos, which ought properly to be phigx, phiggos, and there are other examples.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">454</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  That is quite true, Socrates.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">456</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">457</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, that is true.</div><div class="sentence"> And therefore a wise dictator, like yourself, should observe the laws of moderation and probability.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">458</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Such is my desire.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">459</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And mine, too, Hermogenes.</div><div class="sentence"> But do not be too much of a precisian, or “you will unnerve me of my strength (Iliad.</div><div class="sentence"> ).” When you have allowed me to add mechane (contrivance) to techne (art) I shall be at the top of my bent, for I conceive mechane to be a sign of great accomplishment—anein; for mekos has the meaning of greatness, and these two, mekos and anein, make up the word mechane.</div><div class="sentence"> But, as I was saying, being now at the top of my bent, I should like to consider the meaning of the two words arete (virtue) and kakia (vice); arete I do not as yet understand, but kakia is transparent, and agrees with the principles which preceded, for all things being in a flux (ionton), kakia is kakos ion (going badly); and this evil motion when existing in the soul has the general name of kakia, or vice, specially appropriated to it.</div><div class="sentence"> The meaning of kakos ienai may be further illustrated by the use of deilia (cowardice), which ought to have come after andreia, but was forgotten, and, as I fear, is not the only word which has been passed over.</div><div class="sentence"> Deilia signifies that the soul is bound with a strong chain (desmos), for lian means strength, and therefore deilia expresses the greatest and strongest bond of the soul; and aporia (difficulty) is an evil of the same nature (from a (alpha) not, and poreuesthai to go), like anything else which is an impediment to motion and movement.</div><div class="sentence"> Then the word kakia appears to mean kakos ienai, or going badly, or limping and halting; of which the consequence is, that the soul becomes filled with vice.</div><div class="sentence"> And if kakia is the name of this sort of thing, arete will be the opposite of it, signifying in the first place ease of motion, then that the stream of the good soul is unimpeded, and has therefore the attribute of ever flowing without let or hindrance, and is therefore called arete, or, more correctly, aeireite (ever-flowing), and may perhaps have had another form, airete (eligible), indicating that nothing is more eligible than virtue, and this has been hammered into arete.</div><div class="sentence"> I daresay that you will deem this to be another invention of mine, but I think that if the previous word kakia was right, then arete is also right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">460</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  But what is the meaning of kakon, which has played so great a part in your previous discourse?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">461</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That is a very singular word about which I can hardly form an opinion, and therefore I must have recourse to my ingenious device.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">465</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The meaning of aischron is evident, being only aei ischon roes (always preventing from flowing), and this is in accordance with our former derivations.</div><div class="sentence"> For the name-giver was a great enemy to stagnation of all sorts, and hence he gave the name aeischoroun to that which hindered the flux (aei ischon roun), and that is now beaten together into aischron.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">489</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The meaning of sumpheron (expedient) I think that you may discover for yourself by the light of the previous examples,—for it is a sister word to episteme, meaning just the motion (pora) of the soul accompanying the world, and things which are done upon this principle are called sumphora or sumpheronta, because they are carried round with the world.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">490</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  That is probable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">491</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Again, cherdaleon (gainful) is called from cherdos (gain), but you must alter the delta into nu if you want to get at the meaning; for this word also signifies good, but in another way; he who gave the name intended to express the power of admixture (kerannumenon) and universal penetration in the good; in forming the word, however, he inserted a delta instead of a nu, and so made kerdos.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">492</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but what is lusiteloun (profitable)?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">493</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose, Hermogenes, that people do not mean by the profitable the gainful or that which pays (luei) the retailer, but they use the word in the sense of swift.</div><div class="sentence"> You regard the profitable (lusiteloun), as that which being the swiftest thing in existence, allows of no stay in things and no pause or end of motion, but always, if there begins to be any end, lets things go again (luei), and makes motion immortal and unceasing:  and in this point of view, as appears to me, the good is happily denominated lusiteloun—being that which looses (luon) the end (telos) of motion.</div><div class="sentence"> Ophelimon (the advantageous) is derived from ophellein, meaning that which creates and increases; this latter is a common Homeric word, and has a foreign character.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">494</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  And what do you say of their opposites?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">501</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The word blaberon is that which is said to hinder or harm (blaptein) the stream (roun); blapton is boulomenon aptein (seeking to hold or bind); for aptein is the same as dein, and dein is always a term of censure; boulomenon aptein roun (wanting to bind the stream) would properly be boulapteroun, and this, as I imagine, is improved into blaberon.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">521</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Not if you restore the ancient form, which is more likely to be the correct one, and read dion instead of deon; if you convert the epsilon into an iota after the old fashion, this word will then agree with other words meaning good; for dion, not deon, signifies the good, and is a term of praise; and the author of names has not contradicted himself, but in all these various appellations, deon (obligatory), ophelimon (advantageous), lusiteloun (profitable), kerdaleon (gainful), agathon (good), sumpheron (expedient), euporon (plenteous), the same conception is implied of the ordering or all-pervading principle which is praised, and the restraining and binding principle which is censured.</div><div class="sentence"> And this is further illustrated by the word zemiodes (hurtful), which if the zeta is only changed into delta as in the ancient language, becomes demiodes; and this name, as you will perceive, is given to that which binds motion (dounti ion).</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">522</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  What do you say of edone (pleasure), lupe (pain), epithumia (desire), and the like, Socrates?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">523</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I do not think, Hermogenes, that there is any great difficulty about them—edone is e (eta) onesis, the action which tends to advantage; and the original form may be supposed to have been eone, but this has been altered by the insertion of the delta.</div><div class="sentence"> Lupe appears to be derived from the relaxation (luein) which the body feels when in sorrow; ania (trouble) is the hindrance of motion (alpha and ienai); algedon (distress), if I am not mistaken, is a foreign word, which is derived from aleinos (grievous); odune (grief) is called from the putting on (endusis) sorrow; in achthedon (vexation) “the word too labours,” as any one may see; chara (joy) is the very expression of the fluency and diffusion of the soul (cheo); terpsis (delight) is so called from the pleasure creeping (erpon) through the soul, which may be likened to a breath (pnoe) and is properly erpnoun, but has been altered by time into terpnon; eupherosune (cheerfulness) and epithumia explain themselves; the former, which ought to be eupherosune and has been changed euphrosune, is named, as every one may see, from the soul moving (pheresthai) in harmony with nature; epithumia is really e epi ton thumon iousa dunamis, the power which enters into the soul; thumos (passion) is called from the rushing (thuseos) and boiling of the soul; imeros (desire) denotes the stream (rous) which most draws the soul dia ten esin tes roes—because flowing with desire (iemenos), and expresses a longing after things and violent attraction of the soul to them, and is termed imeros from possessing this power; pothos (longing) is expressive of the desire of that which is not present but absent, and in another place (pou); this is the reason why the name pothos is applied to things absent, as imeros is to things present; eros (love) is so called because flowing in (esron) from without; the stream is not inherent, but is an influence introduced through the eyes, and from flowing in was called esros (influx) in the old time when they used omicron for omega, and is called eros, now that omega is substituted for omicron.</div><div class="sentence"> But why do you not give me another word?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">524</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  What do you think of doxa (opinion), and that class of words?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">525</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Doxa is either derived from dioxis (pursuit), and expresses the march of the soul in the pursuit of knowledge, or from the shooting of a bow (toxon); the latter is more likely, and is confirmed by oiesis (thinking), which is only oisis (moving), and implies the movement of the soul to the essential nature of each thing—just as boule (counsel) has to do with shooting (bole); and boulesthai (to wish) combines the notion of aiming and deliberating—all these words seem to follow doxa, and all involve the idea of shooting, just as aboulia, absence of counsel, on the other hand, is a mishap, or missing, or mistaking of the mark, or aim, or proposal, or object.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">528</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, then, let me ask about the greatest and noblest, such as aletheia (truth) and pseudos (falsehood) and on (being), not forgetting to enquire why the word onoma (name), which is the theme of our discussion, has this name of onoma.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">529</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  You know the word maiesthai (to seek)?</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">531</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The word onoma seems to be a compressed sentence, signifying on ou zetema (being for which there is a search); as is still more obvious in onomaston (notable), which states in so many words that real existence is that for which there is a seeking (on ou masma); aletheia is also an agglomeration of theia ale (divine wandering), implying the divine motion of existence; pseudos (falsehood) is the opposite of motion; here is another ill name given by the legislator to stagnation and forced inaction, which he compares to sleep (eudein); but the original meaning of the word is disguised by the addition of psi; on and ousia are ion with an iota broken off; this agrees with the true principle, for being (on) is also moving (ion), and the same may be said of not being, which is likewise called not going (oukion or ouki on = ouk ion).</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">537</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  To say that names which we do not understand are of foreign origin; and this is very likely the right answer, and something of this kind may be true of them; but also the original forms of words may have been lost in the lapse of ages; names have been so twisted in all manner of ways, that I should not be surprised if the old language when compared with that now in use would appear to us to be a barbarous tongue.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">538</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Very likely.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">551</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And that this is true of the primary quite as much as of the secondary names, is implied in their being names.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">586</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">597</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In the first place, the letter rho appears to me to be the general instrument expressing all motion (kinesis).</div><div class="sentence"> But I have not yet explained the meaning of this latter word, which is just iesis (going); for the letter eta was not in use among the ancients, who only employed epsilon; and the root is kiein, which is a foreign form, the same as ienai.</div><div class="sentence"> And the old word kinesis will be correctly given as iesis in corresponding modern letters.</div><div class="sentence"> Assuming this foreign root kiein, and allowing for the change of the eta and the insertion of the nu, we have kinesis, which should have been kieinsis or eisis; and stasis is the negative of ienai (or eisis), and has been improved into stasis.</div><div class="sentence"> Now the letter rho, as I was saying, appeared to the imposer of names an excellent instrument for the expression of motion; and he frequently uses the letter for this purpose:  for example, in the actual words rein and roe he represents motion by rho; also in the words tromos (trembling), trachus (rugged); and again, in words such as krouein (strike), thrauein (crush), ereikein (bruise), thruptein (break), kermatixein (crumble), rumbein (whirl):  of all these sorts of movements he generally finds an expression in the letter R, because, as I imagine, he had observed that the tongue was most agitated and least at rest in the pronunciation of this letter, which he therefore used in order to express motion, just as by the letter iota he expresses the subtle elements which pass through all things.</div><div class="sentence"> This is why he uses the letter iota as imitative of motion, ienai, iesthai.</div><div class="sentence"> And there is another class of letters, phi, psi, sigma, and xi, of which the pronunciation is accompanied by great expenditure of breath; these are used in the imitation of such notions as psuchron (shivering), xeon (seething), seiesthai, (to be shaken), seismos (shock), and are always introduced by the giver of names when he wants to imitate what is phusodes (windy).</div><div class="sentence"> He seems to have thought that the closing and pressure of the tongue in the utterance of delta and tau was expressive of binding and rest in a place:  he further observed the liquid movement of lambda, in the pronunciation of which the tongue slips, and in this he found the expression of smoothness, as in leios (level), and in the word oliothanein (to slip) itself, liparon (sleek), in the word kollodes (gluey), and the like:  the heavier sound of gamma detained the slipping tongue, and the union of the two gave the notion of a glutinous clammy nature, as in glischros, glukus, gloiodes.</div><div class="sentence"> The nu he observed to be sounded from within, and therefore to have a notion of inwardness; hence he introduced the sound in endos and entos:  alpha he assigned to the expression of size, and nu of length, because they are great letters:  omicron was the sign of roundness, and therefore there is plenty of omicron mixed up in the word goggulon (round).</div><div class="sentence"> Thus did the legislator, reducing all things into letters and syllables, and impressing on them names and signs, and out of them by imitation compounding other signs.</div><div class="sentence"> That is my view, Hermogenes, of the truth of names; but I should like to hear what Cratylus has more to say.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">598</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  But, Socrates, as I was telling you before, Cratylus mystifies me; he says that there is a fitness of names, but he never explains what is this fitness, so that I cannot tell whether his obscurity is intended or not.</div><div class="sentence"> Tell me now, Cratylus, here in the presence of Socrates, do you agree in what Socrates has been saying about names, or have you something better of your own?</div><div class="sentence"> and if you have, tell me what your view is, and then you will either learn of Socrates, or Socrates and I will learn of you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">599</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but surely, Hermogenes, you do not suppose that you can learn, or I explain, any subject of importance all in a moment; at any rate, not such a subject as language, which is, perhaps, the very greatest of all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">600</span><div class="speaker">HERMOGENES</div><div class="sentence">  No, indeed; but, as Hesiod says, and I agree with him, “to add little to little” is worth while.</div><div class="sentence"> And, therefore, if you think that you can add anything at all, however small, to our knowledge, take a little trouble and oblige Socrates, and me too, who certainly have a claim upon you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">601</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I am by no means positive, Cratylus, in the view which Hermogenes and myself have worked out; and therefore do not hesitate to say what you think, which if it be better than my own view I shall gladly accept.</div><div class="sentence"> And I should not be at all surprized to find that you have found some better notion.</div><div class="sentence"> For you have evidently reflected on these matters and have had teachers, and if you have really a better theory of the truth of names, you may count me in the number of your disciples.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">602</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  You are right, Socrates, in saying that I have made a study of these matters, and I might possibly convert you into a disciple.</div><div class="sentence"> But I fear that the opposite is more probable, and I already find myself moved to say to you what Achilles in the “Prayers” says to Ajax,—</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">603</span> <div class="sentence">  “Illustrious Ajax, son of Telamon, lord of the people, You appear to have spoken in all things much to my mind.”</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">604</span> <div class="sentence">  And you, Socrates, appear to me to be an oracle, and to give answers much to my mind, whether you are inspired by Euthyphro, or whether some Muse may have long been an inhabitant of your breast, unconsciously to yourself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">605</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Excellent Cratylus, I have long been wondering at my own wisdom; I cannot trust myself.</div><div class="sentence"> And I think that I ought to stop and ask myself What am I saying?</div><div class="sentence"> for there is nothing worse than self-deception—when the deceiver is always at home and always with you—it is quite terrible, and therefore I ought often to retrace my steps and endeavour to “look fore and aft,” in the words of the aforesaid Homer.</div><div class="sentence"> And now let me see; where are we?</div><div class="sentence"> Have we not been saying that the correct name indicates the nature of the thing: —has this proposition been sufficiently proven?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">606</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates, what you say, as I am disposed to think, is quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">607</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Names, then, are given in order to instruct?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">608</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>

<div class="speech"><span class="ref">611</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And who are they?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">612</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  The legislators, of whom you spoke at first.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">613</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And does this art grow up among men like other arts?</div><div class="sentence"> Let me explain what I mean:  of painters, some are better and some worse?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">614</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">615</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  The better painters execute their works, I mean their figures, better, and the worse execute them worse; and of builders also, the better sort build fairer houses, and the worse build them worse.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">616</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">617</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And among legislators, there are some who do their work better and some worse?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">618</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  No; there I do not agree with you.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">619</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then you do not think that some laws are better and others worse?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">620</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  No, indeed.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">621</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Or that one name is better than another?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">622</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">623</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then all names are rightly imposed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">624</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, if they are names at all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">625</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, what do you say to the name of our friend Hermogenes, which was mentioned before: —assuming that he has nothing of the nature of Hermes in him, shall we say that this is a wrong name, or not his name at all?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">626</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should reply that Hermogenes is not his name at all, but only appears to be his, and is really the name of somebody else, who has the nature which corresponds to it.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">627</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if a man were to call him Hermogenes, would he not be even speaking falsely?</div><div class="sentence"> For there may be a doubt whether you can call him Hermogenes, if he is not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">628</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  What do you mean?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">629</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Are you maintaining that falsehood is impossible?</div><div class="sentence"> For if this is your meaning I should answer, that there have been plenty of liars in all ages.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">630</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Why, Socrates, how can a man say that which is not?—say something and yet say nothing?</div><div class="sentence"> For is not falsehood saying the thing which is not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">631</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Your argument, friend, is too subtle for a man of my age.</div><div class="sentence"> But I should like to know whether you are one of those philosophers who think that falsehood may be spoken but not said?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">632</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Neither spoken nor said.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">633</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Nor uttered nor addressed?</div><div class="sentence"> For example:  If a person, saluting you in a foreign country, were to take your hand and say:  “Hail, Athenian stranger, Hermogenes, son of Smicrion”—these words, whether spoken, said, uttered, or addressed, would have no application to you but only to our friend Hermogenes, or perhaps to nobody at all?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">634</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  In my opinion, Socrates, the speaker would only be talking nonsense.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">635</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but that will be quite enough for me, if you will tell me whether the nonsense would be true or false, or partly true and partly false: —which is all that I want to know.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">636</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should say that he would be putting himself in motion to no purpose; and that his words would be an unmeaning sound like the noise of hammering at a brazen pot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">637</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But let us see, Cratylus, whether we cannot find a meeting-point, for you would admit that the name is not the same with the thing named?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">638</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">639</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And would you further acknowledge that the name is an imitation of the thing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">640</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">641</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And you would say that pictures are also imitations of things, but in another way?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">642</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">643</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I believe you may be right, but I do not rightly understand you.</div><div class="sentence"> Please to say, then, whether both sorts of imitation (I mean both pictures or words) are not equally attributable and applicable to the things of which they are the imitation.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">644</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  They are.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">645</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  First look at the matter thus:  you may attribute the likeness of the man to the man, and of the woman to the woman; and so on?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">646</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">647</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And conversely you may attribute the likeness of the man to the woman, and of the woman to the man?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">648</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">649</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And are both modes of assigning them right, or only the first?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">650</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Only the first.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">651</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That is to say, the mode of assignment which attributes to each that which belongs to them and is like them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">652</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is my view.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">653</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Now then, as I am desirous that we being friends should have a good understanding about the argument, let me state my view to you:  the first mode of assignment, whether applied to figures or to names, I call right, and when applied to names only, true as well as right; and the other mode of giving and assigning the name which is unlike, I call wrong, and in the case of names, false as well as wrong.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">654</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  That may be true, Socrates, in the case of pictures; they may be wrongly assigned; but not in the case of names—they must be always right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">655</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, what is the difference?</div><div class="sentence"> May I not go to a man and say to him, “This is your picture,” showing him his own likeness, or perhaps the likeness of a woman; and when I say “show,” I mean bring before the sense of sight.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">656</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">657</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And may I not go to him again, and say, “This is your name”?—for the name, like the picture, is an imitation.</div><div class="sentence"> May I not say to him—“This is your name”?</div><div class="sentence"> and may I not then bring to his sense of hearing the imitation of himself, when I say, “This is a man”; or of a female of the human species, when I say, “This is a woman,” as the case may be?</div><div class="sentence"> Is not all that quite possible?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">658</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I would fain agree with you, Socrates; and therefore I say, Granted.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">659</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  That is very good of you, if I am right, which need hardly be disputed at present.</div><div class="sentence"> But if I can assign names as well as pictures to objects, the right assignment of them we may call truth, and the wrong assignment of them falsehood.</div><div class="sentence"> Now if there be such a wrong assignment of names, there may also be a wrong or inappropriate assignment of verbs; and if of names and verbs then of the sentences, which are made up of them.</div><div class="sentence"> What do you say, Cratylus?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">660</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I agree; and think that what you say is very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">661</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And further, primitive nouns may be compared to pictures, and in pictures you may either give all the appropriate colours and figures, or you may not give them all—some may be wanting; or there may be too many or too much of them—may there not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">662</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">663</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And he who gives all gives a perfect picture or figure; and he who takes away or adds also gives a picture or figure, but not a good one.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">664</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">665</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In like manner, he who by syllables and letters imitates the nature of things, if he gives all that is appropriate will produce a good image, or in other words a name; but if he subtracts or perhaps adds a little, he will make an image but not a good one; whence I infer that some names are well and others ill made.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">666</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">667</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then the artist of names may be sometimes good, or he may be bad?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">668</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">669</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And this artist of names is called the legislator?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">670</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">671</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then like other artists the legislator may be good or he may be bad; it must surely be so if our former admissions hold good?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">672</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true, Socrates; but the case of language, you see, is different; for when by the help of grammar we assign the letters alpha or beta, or any other letters to a certain name, then, if we add, or subtract, or misplace a letter, the name which is written is not only written wrongly, but not written at all; and in any of these cases becomes other than a name.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">673</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But I doubt whether your view is altogether correct, Cratylus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">674</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">675</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I believe that what you say may be true about numbers, which must be just what they are, or not be at all; for example, the number ten at once becomes other than ten if a unit be added or subtracted, and so of any other number:  but this does not apply to that which is qualitative or to anything which is represented under an image.</div><div class="sentence"> I should say rather that the image, if expressing in every point the entire reality, would no longer be an image.</div><div class="sentence"> Let us suppose the existence of two objects:  one of them shall be Cratylus, and the other the image of Cratylus; and we will suppose, further, that some God makes not only a representation such as a painter would make of your outward form and colour, but also creates an inward organization like yours, having the same warmth and softness; and into this infuses motion, and soul, and mind, such as you have, and in a word copies all your qualities, and places them by you in another form; would you say that this was Cratylus and the image of Cratylus, or that there were two Cratyluses?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">676</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should say that there were two Cratyluses.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">677</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then you see, my friend, that we must find some other principle of truth in images, and also in names; and not insist that an image is no longer an image when something is added or subtracted.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you not perceive that images are very far from having qualities which are the exact counterpart of the realities which they represent?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">678</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I see.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">679</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But then how ridiculous would be the effect of names on things, if they were exactly the same with them!</div><div class="sentence"> For they would be the doubles of them, and no one would be able to determine which were the names and which were the realities.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">680</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">681</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then fear not, but have the courage to admit that one name may be correctly and another incorrectly given; and do not insist that the name shall be exactly the same with the thing; but allow the occasional substitution of a wrong letter, and if of a letter also of a noun in a sentence, and if of a noun in a sentence also of a sentence which is not appropriate to the matter, and acknowledge that the thing may be named, and described, so long as the general character of the thing which you are describing is retained; and this, as you will remember, was remarked by Hermogenes and myself in the particular instance of the names of the letters.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">682</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I remember.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">683</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Good; and when the general character is preserved, even if some of the proper letters are wanting, still the thing is signified;—well, if all the letters are given; not well, when only a few of them are given.</div><div class="sentence"> I think that we had better admit this, lest we be punished like travellers in Aegina who wander about the street late at night:  and be likewise told by truth herself that we have arrived too late; or if not, you must find out some new notion of correctness of names, and no longer maintain that a name is the expression of a thing in letters or syllables; for if you say both, you will be inconsistent with yourself.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">684</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I quite acknowledge, Socrates, what you say to be very reasonable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">685</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then as we are agreed thus far, let us ask ourselves whether a name rightly imposed ought not to have the proper letters.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">686</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">687</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And the proper letters are those which are like the things?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">688</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">689</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Enough then of names which are rightly given.</div><div class="sentence"> And in names which are incorrectly given, the greater part may be supposed to be made up of proper and similar letters, or there would be no likeness; but there will be likewise a part which is improper and spoils the beauty and formation of the word:  you would admit that?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">690</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  There would be no use, Socrates, in my quarrelling with you, since I cannot be satisfied that a name which is incorrectly given is a name at all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">691</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Do you admit a name to be the representation of a thing?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">692</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">693</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But do you not allow that some nouns are primitive, and some derived?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">694</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, I do.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">695</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then if you admit that primitive or first nouns are representations of things, is there any better way of framing representations than by assimilating them to the objects as much as you can; or do you prefer the notion of Hermogenes and of many others, who say that names are conventional, and have a meaning to those who have agreed about them, and who have previous knowledge of the things intended by them, and that convention is the only principle; and whether you abide by our present convention, or make a new and opposite one, according to which you call small great and great small—that, they would say, makes no difference, if you are only agreed.</div><div class="sentence"> Which of these two notions do you prefer?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">696</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Representation by likeness, Socrates, is infinitely better than representation by any chance sign.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">697</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Very good:  but if the name is to be like the thing, the letters out of which the first names are composed must also be like things.</div><div class="sentence"> Returning to the image of the picture, I would ask, How could any one ever compose a picture which would be like anything at all, if there were not pigments in nature which resembled the things imitated, and out of which the picture is composed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">698</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Impossible.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">699</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  No more could names ever resemble any actually existing thing, unless the original elements of which they are compounded bore some degree of resemblance to the objects of which the names are the imitation:  And the original elements are letters?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">700</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">701</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let me now invite you to consider what Hermogenes and I were saying about sounds.</div><div class="sentence"> Do you agree with me that the letter rho is expressive of rapidity, motion, and hardness?</div><div class="sentence"> Were we right or wrong in saying so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">702</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should say that you were right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">703</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And that lamda was expressive of smoothness, and softness, and the like?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">704</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  There again you were right.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">705</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And yet, as you are aware, that which is called by us sklerotes, is by the Eretrians called skleroter.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">706</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">707</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But are the letters rho and sigma equivalents; and is there the same significance to them in the termination rho, which there is to us in sigma, or is there no significance to one of us?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">708</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Nay, surely there is a significance to both of us.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">709</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  In as far as they are like, or in as far as they are unlike?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">710</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  In as far as they are like.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">711</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Are they altogether alike?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">712</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; for the purpose of expressing motion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">713</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And what do you say of the insertion of the lamda?</div><div class="sentence"> for that is expressive not of hardness but of softness.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">714</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Why, perhaps the letter lamda is wrongly inserted, Socrates, and should be altered into rho, as you were saying to Hermogenes and in my opinion rightly, when you spoke of adding and subtracting letters upon occasion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">715</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Good.</div><div class="sentence"> But still the word is intelligible to both of us; when I say skleros (hard), you know what I mean.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">716</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, my dear friend, and the explanation of that is custom.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">717</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And what is custom but convention?</div><div class="sentence"> I utter a sound which I understand, and you know that I understand the meaning of the sound:  this is what you are saying?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">718</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">719</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if when I speak you know my meaning, there is an indication given by me to you?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">720</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">721</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  This indication of my meaning may proceed from unlike as well as from like, for example in the lamda of sklerotes.</div><div class="sentence"> But if this is true, then you have made a convention with yourself, and the correctness of a name turns out to be convention, since letters which are unlike are indicative equally with those which are like, if they are sanctioned by custom and convention.</div><div class="sentence"> And even supposing that you distinguish custom from convention ever so much, still you must say that the signification of words is given by custom and not by likeness, for custom may indicate by the unlike as well as by the like.</div><div class="sentence"> But as we are agreed thus far, Cratylus (for I shall assume that your silence gives consent), then custom and convention must be supposed to contribute to the indication of our thoughts; for suppose we take the instance of number, how can you ever imagine, my good friend, that you will find names resembling every individual number, unless you allow that which you term convention and agreement to have authority in determining the correctness of names?</div><div class="sentence"> I quite agree with you that words should as far as possible resemble things; but I fear that this dragging in of resemblance, as Hermogenes says, is a shabby thing, which has to be supplemented by the mechanical aid of convention with a view to correctness; for I believe that if we could always, or almost always, use likenesses, which are perfectly appropriate, this would be the most perfect state of language; as the opposite is the most imperfect.</div><div class="sentence"> But let me ask you, what is the force of names, and what is the use of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">722</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  The use of names, Socrates, as I should imagine, is to inform:  the simple truth is, that he who knows names knows also the things which are expressed by them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">723</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  I suppose you mean to say, Cratylus, that as the name is, so also is the thing; and that he who knows the one will also know the other, because they are similars, and all similars fall under the same art or science; and therefore you would say that he who knows names will also know things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">724</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  That is precisely what I mean.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">725</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But let us consider what is the nature of this information about things which, according to you, is given us by names.</div><div class="sentence"> Is it the best sort of information?</div><div class="sentence"> or is there any other?</div><div class="sentence"> What do you say?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">726</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I believe that to be both the only and the best sort of information about them; there can be no other.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">727</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But do you believe that in the discovery of them, he who discovers the names discovers also the things; or is this only the method of instruction, and is there some other method of enquiry and discovery.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">728</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I certainly believe that the methods of enquiry and discovery are of the same nature as instruction.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">729</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but do you not see, Cratylus, that he who follows names in the search after things, and analyses their meaning, is in great danger of being deceived?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">730</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  How so?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">731</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why clearly he who first gave names gave them according to his conception of the things which they signified—did he not?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">732</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">733</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And if his conception was erroneous, and he gave names according to his conception, in what position shall we who are his followers find ourselves?</div><div class="sentence"> Shall we not be deceived by him?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">734</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  But, Socrates, am I not right in thinking that he must surely have known; or else, as I was saying, his names would not be names at all?</div><div class="sentence"> And you have a clear proof that he has not missed the truth, and the proof is—that he is perfectly consistent.</div><div class="sentence"> Did you ever observe in speaking that all the words which you utter have a common character and purpose?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">735</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But that, friend Cratylus, is no answer.</div><div class="sentence"> For if he did begin in error, he may have forced the remainder into agreement with the original error and with himself; there would be nothing strange in this, any more than in geometrical diagrams, which have often a slight and invisible flaw in the first part of the process, and are consistently mistaken in the long deductions which follow.</div><div class="sentence"> And this is the reason why every man should expend his chief thought and attention on the consideration of his first principles: —are they or are they not rightly laid down?</div><div class="sentence"> and when he has duly sifted them, all the rest will follow.</div><div class="sentence"> Now I should be astonished to find that names are really consistent.</div><div class="sentence"> And here let us revert to our former discussion:  Were we not saying that all things are in motion and progress and flux, and that this idea of motion is expressed by names?</div><div class="sentence"> Do you not conceive that to be the meaning of them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">736</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes; that is assuredly their meaning, and the true meaning.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">737</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us revert to episteme (knowledge) and observe how ambiguous this word is, seeming rather to signify stopping the soul at things than going round with them; and therefore we should leave the beginning as at present, and not reject the epsilon, but make an insertion of an iota instead of an epsilon (not pioteme, but epiisteme).</div><div class="sentence"> Take another example:  bebaion (sure) is clearly the expression of station and position, and not of motion.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, the word istoria (enquiry) bears upon the face of it the stopping (istanai) of the stream; and the word piston (faithful) certainly indicates cessation of motion; then, again, mneme (memory), as any one may see, expresses rest in the soul, and not motion.</div><div class="sentence"> Moreover, words such as amartia and sumphora, which have a bad sense, viewed in the light of their etymologies will be the same as sunesis and episteme and other words which have a good sense (compare omartein, sunienai, epesthai, sumpheresthai); and much the same may be said of amathia and akolasia, for amathia may be explained as e ama theo iontos poreia, and akolasia as e akolouthia tois pragmasin.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus the names which in these instances we find to have the worst sense, will turn out to be framed on the same principle as those which have the best.</div><div class="sentence"> And any one I believe who would take the trouble might find many other examples in which the giver of names indicates, not that things are in motion or progress, but that they are at rest; which is the opposite of motion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">738</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes, Socrates, but observe; the greater number express motion.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">739</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  What of that, Cratylus?</div><div class="sentence"> Are we to count them like votes?</div><div class="sentence"> and is correctness of names the voice of the majority?</div><div class="sentence"> Are we to say of whichever sort there are most, those are the true ones?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">740</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  No; that is not reasonable.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">741</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly not.</div><div class="sentence"> But let us have done with this question and proceed to another, about which I should like to know whether you think with me.</div><div class="sentence"> Were we not lately acknowledging that the first givers of names in states, both Hellenic and barbarous, were the legislators, and that the art which gave names was the art of the legislator?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">742</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Quite true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">743</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Tell me, then, did the first legislators, who were the givers of the first names, know or not know the things which they named?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">744</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  They must have known, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">745</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Why, yes, friend Cratylus, they could hardly have been ignorant.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">746</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should say not.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">747</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us return to the point from which we digressed.</div><div class="sentence"> You were saying, if you remember, that he who gave names must have known the things which he named; are you still of that opinion?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">748</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I am.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">749</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And would you say that the giver of the first names had also a knowledge of the things which he named?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">750</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">751</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But how could he have learned or discovered things from names if the primitive names were not yet given?</div><div class="sentence"> For, if we are correct in our view, the only way of learning and discovering things, is either to discover names for ourselves or to learn them from others.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">752</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I think that there is a good deal in what you say, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">753</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if things are only to be known through names, how can we suppose that the givers of names had knowledge, or were legislators before there were names at all, and therefore before they could have known them?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">754</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I believe, Socrates, the true account of the matter to be, that a power more than human gave things their first names, and that the names which are thus given are necessarily their true names.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">755</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then how came the giver of the names, if he was an inspired being or God, to contradict himself?</div><div class="sentence"> For were we not saying just now that he made some names expressive of rest and others of motion?</div><div class="sentence"> Were we mistaken?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">756</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  But I suppose one of the two not to be names at all.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">757</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And which, then, did he make, my good friend; those which are expressive of rest, or those which are expressive of motion?</div><div class="sentence"> This is a point which, as I said before, cannot be determined by counting them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">758</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  No; not in that way, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">759</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if this is a battle of names, some of them asserting that they are like the truth, others contending that THEY are, how or by what criterion are we to decide between them?</div><div class="sentence"> For there are no other names to which appeal can be made, but obviously recourse must be had to another standard which, without employing names, will make clear which of the two are right; and this must be a standard which shows the truth of things.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">760</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I agree.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">761</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But if that is true, Cratylus, then I suppose that things may be known without names?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">762</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">763</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  But how would you expect to know them?</div><div class="sentence"> What other way can there be of knowing them, except the true and natural way, through their affinities, when they are akin to each other, and through themselves?</div><div class="sentence"> For that which is other and different from them must signify something other and different from them.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">764</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  What you are saying is, I think, true.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">765</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Well, but reflect; have we not several times acknowledged that names rightly given are the likenesses and images of the things which they name?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">766</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Yes.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">767</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Let us suppose that to any extent you please you can learn things through the medium of names, and suppose also that you can learn them from the things themselves—which is likely to be the nobler and clearer way; to learn of the image, whether the image and the truth of which the image is the expression have been rightly conceived, or to learn of the truth whether the truth and the image of it have been duly executed?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">768</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I should say that we must learn of the truth.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">769</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  How real existence is to be studied or discovered is, I suspect, beyond you and me.</div><div class="sentence"> But we may admit so much, that the knowledge of things is not to be derived from names.</div><div class="sentence"> No; they must be studied and investigated in themselves.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">770</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Clearly, Socrates.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">771</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  There is another point.</div><div class="sentence"> I should not like us to be imposed upon by the appearance of such a multitude of names, all tending in the same direction.</div><div class="sentence"> I myself do not deny that the givers of names did really give them under the idea that all things were in motion and flux; which was their sincere but, I think, mistaken opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> And having fallen into a kind of whirlpool themselves, they are carried round, and want to drag us in after them.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a matter, master Cratylus, about which I often dream, and should like to ask your opinion:  Tell me, whether there is or is not any absolute beauty or good, or any other absolute existence?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">772</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly, Socrates, I think so.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">773</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then let us seek the true beauty:  not asking whether a face is fair, or anything of that sort, for all such things appear to be in a flux; but let us ask whether the true beauty is not always beautiful.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">774</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">775</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  And can we rightly speak of a beauty which is always passing away, and is first this and then that; must not the same thing be born and retire and vanish while the word is in our mouths?</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">776</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Undoubtedly.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">777</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then how can that be a real thing which is never in the same state?</div><div class="sentence"> for obviously things which are the same cannot change while they remain the same; and if they are always the same and in the same state, and never depart from their original form, they can never change or be moved.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">778</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Certainly they cannot.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">779</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Nor yet can they be known by any one; for at the moment that the observer approaches, then they become other and of another nature, so that you cannot get any further in knowing their nature or state, for you cannot know that which has no state.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">780</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  True.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">781</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Nor can we reasonably say, Cratylus, that there is knowledge at all, if everything is in a state of transition and there is nothing abiding; for knowledge too cannot continue to be knowledge unless continuing always to abide and exist.</div><div class="sentence"> But if the very nature of knowledge changes, at the time when the change occurs there will be no knowledge; and if the transition is always going on, there will always be no knowledge, and, according to this view, there will be no one to know and nothing to be known:  but if that which knows and that which is known exists ever, and the beautiful and the good and every other thing also exist, then I do not think that they can resemble a process or flux, as we were just now supposing.</div><div class="sentence"> Whether there is this eternal nature in things, or whether the truth is what Heracleitus and his followers and many others say, is a question hard to determine; and no man of sense will like to put himself or the education of his mind in the power of names:  neither will he so far trust names or the givers of names as to be confident in any knowledge which condemns himself and other existences to an unhealthy state of unreality; he will not believe that all things leak like a pot, or imagine that the world is a man who has a running at the nose.</div><div class="sentence"> This may be true, Cratylus, but is also very likely to be untrue; and therefore I would not have you be too easily persuaded of it.</div><div class="sentence"> Reflect well and like a man, and do not easily accept such a doctrine; for you are young and of an age to learn.</div><div class="sentence"> And when you have found the truth, come and tell me.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">782</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  I will do as you say, though I can assure you, Socrates, that I have been considering the matter already, and the result of a great deal of trouble and consideration is that I incline to Heracleitus.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">783</span><div class="speaker">SOCRATES</div><div class="sentence">  Then, another day, my friend, when you come back, you shall give me a lesson; but at present, go into the country, as you are intending, and Hermogenes shall set you on your way.</div></div>
<div class="speech"><span class="ref">784</span><div class="speaker">CRATYLUS</div><div class="sentence">  Very good, Socrates; I hope, however, that you will continue to think about these things yourself.</div></div>
