<pre xml:space="preserve">     Xenophon the Athenian was born 431 B.C. He was a
     pupil of Socrates. He marched with the Spartans,
     and was exiled from Athens. Sparta gave him land
     and property in Scillus, where he lived for many
     years before having to move once more, to settle
     in Corinth. He died in 354 B.C.

     The Memorabilia is a recollection of Socrates in
     word and deed, to show his character as the best
     and happiest of men.

    <p>
      I
    </p>
    <p>
      I have often wondered by what arguments those who indicted (1) Socrates
      could have persuaded the Athenians that his life was justly forfeit to the
      state. The indictment was to this effect: "Socrates is guilty of crime in
      refusing to recognise the gods acknowledged by the state, and importing
      strange divinities of his own; he is further guilty of corrupting the
      young."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (1) {oi grapsamenoi} = Meletus (below, IV. iv. 4, viii. 4; "Apol." 11,
    19), Anytus ("Apol." 29), and Lycon. See Plat. "Apol." II. v. 18;
    Diog. Laert. II. v. (Socr.); M. Schanz, "Plat. Apol. mit deutschen
    Kemmentar, Einleitung," S. 5 foll.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the first place, what evidence did they produce that Socrates refused
      to recognise the gods acknowledged by the state? Was it that he did not
      sacrifice? or that he dispensed with divination? On the contrary, he was
      often to be seen engaged in sacrifice, at home or at the common altars of
      the state. Nor was his dependence on divination less manifest. Indeed that
      saying of his, "A divinity (2) gives me a sign," was on everybody's lips.
      So much so that, if I am not mistaken, it lay at the root of the
      imputation that he imported novel divinities; though there was no greater
      novelty in his case than in that of other believers in oracular help, who
      commonly rely on omens of all sorts: the flight or cry of birds, the
      utterances of man, chance meetings, (3) or a victim's entrails. Even
      according to the popular conception, it is not the mere fowl, it is not
      the chance individual one meets, who knows what things are profitable for
      a man, but it is the gods who vouchsafe by such instruments to signify the
      same. This was also the tenet of Socrates. Only, whereas men ordinarily
      speak of being turned aside, or urged onwards by birds, or other creatures
      encountered on the path, Socrates suited his language to his conviction.
      "The divinity," said he, "gives me a sign." Further, he would constantly
      advise his associates to do this, or beware of doing that, upon the
      authority of this same divine voice; and, as a matter of fact, those who
      listened to his warnings prospered, whilst he who turned a deaf ear to
      them repented afterwards. (4) Yet, it will be readily conceded, he would
      hardly desire to present himself to his everyday companions in the
      character of either knave or fool. Whereas he would have appeared to be
      both, supposing (5) the God-given revelations had but revealed his own
      proneness to deception. It is plain he would not have ventured on forecast
      at all, but for his belief that the words he spoke would in fact be
      verified. Then on whom, or what, was the assurance rooted, if not upon
      God? And if he had faith in the gods, how could he fail to recognise them?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (2) Or, "A divine something." See "Encyc. Brit." "Socrates." Dr. H.
    Jackason; "The Daemon of Socrates," F. W. H. Myers; K. Joel, "Der
    echte und der Xenophontische Sokrates," i. p. 70 foll.; cf.
    Aristot. "M. M." 1182 a 10.

 (3) See Aesch. "P. V." 487, {enodious te sombolous}, "and pathway
    tokens," L. Campbell; Arist. "Birds," 721, {sombolon ornin}:
    "Frogs," 196, {to sometukhon exion}; "Eccl." 792; Hor. "Od." iii.
    27, 1-7.

 (4) See "Anab." III. i. 4; "Symp." iv. 48.

 (5) Or, "if his vaunted manifestations from heaven had but manifested
    the falsity of his judgment."
</pre>
    <p>
      But his mode of dealing with his intimates has another aspect. As regards
      the ordinary necessities of life, (6) his advice was, "Act as you believe
      (7) these things may best be done." But in the case of those darker
      problems, the issues of which are incalculable, he directed his friends to
      consult the oracle, whether the business should be undertaken or not. "No
      one," he would say, "who wishes to manage a house or city with success: no
      one aspiring to guide the helm of state aright, can afford to dipense with
      aid from above. Doubtless, skill in carpentering, building, smithying,
      farming, of the art of governing men, together with the theory of these
      processes, and the sciences of arithmetic, economy, strategy, are affairs
      of study, and within the grasp of human intelligence. Yet there is a side
      even of these, and that not the least important, which the gods reserve to
      themselves, the bearing of which is hidden from mortal vision. Thus, let a
      man sow a field or plant a farm never so well, yet he cannot foretell who
      will gather in the fruits: another may build him a house of fairest
      proportion, yet he knows not who will inhabit it. Neither can a general
      foresee whether it will profit him to conduct a campaign, nor a politician
      be certain whether his leadership will turn to evil or good. Nor can the
      man who weds a fair wife, looking forward to joy, know whether through her
      he shall not reap sorrow. Neither can he who has built up a powerful
      connection in the state know whether he shall not by means of it be cast
      out of his city. To suppose that all these matters lay within the scope of
      human judgment, to the exclusion of the preternatural, was preternatural
      folly. Nor was it less extravagant to go and consult the will of Heaven on
      any questions which it is given to us to decide by dint of learning. As
      though a man should inquire, "Am I to choose an expert driver as my
      coachman, or one who has never handled the reins?" "Shall I appoint a
      mariner to be skipper of my vessel, or a landsman?" And so with respect to
      all we may know by numbering, weighing, and measuring. To seek advice from
      Heaven on such points was a sort of profanity. "Our duty is plain," he
      would observe; "where we are permitted to work through our natural
      faculties, there let us by all means apply them. But in things which are
      hidden, let us seek to gain knowledge from above, by divination; for the
      gods," he added, "grant signs to those to whom they will be gracious."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (6) Or, "in the sphere of the determined," {ta anagkaia} = certa,
    quorum eventus est necessarius; "things positive, the law-ordained
    department of life," as we might say. See Grote, "H. G." i. ch.
    xvi. 500 and passim.

 (7) Reading {os nomizoien}, or if {os enomizen}, translate "As to
    things with certain results, he advised them to do them in the way
    in which he believed they would be done best"; i.e. he did not
    say, "follow your conscience," but, "this course seems best to me
    under the circumstances."
</pre>
    <p>
      Again, Socrates ever lived in the public eye; at early morning he was to
      be seen betaking himself to one of the promenades, or wrestling-grounds;
      at noon he would appear with the gathering crowds in the market-place; and
      as day declined, wherever the largest throng might be encountered, there
      was he to be found, talking for the most part, while any one who chose
      might stop and listen. Yet no one ever heard him say, or saw him do
      anything impious or irreverent. Indeed, in contrast to others he set his
      face against all discussion of such high matters as the nature of the
      Universe; how the "kosmos," as the savants (8) phrase it, came into being;
      (9) or by what forces the celestial phenomena arise. To trouble one's
      brain about such matters was, he argued, to play the fool. He would ask
      first: Did these investigators feel their knowledge of things human so
      complete that they betook themselves to these lofty speculations? Or did
      they maintain that they were playing their proper parts in thus neglecting
      the affairs of man to speculate on the concerns of God? He was astonished
      they did not see how far these problems lay beyond mortal ken; since even
      those who pride themselves most on their discussion of these points differ
      from each other, as madmen do. For just as some madmen, he said, have no
      apprehension of what is truly terrible, others fear where no fear is; some
      are ready to say and do anything in public without the slightest symptom
      of shame; (10) others think they ought not so much as to set foot among
      their fellow-men; some honour neither temple, nor altar, nor aught else
      sacred to the name of God; others bow down to stocks and stones and
      worship the very beasts:—so is it with those thinkers whose minds
      are cumbered with cares (11) concerning the Universal Nature. One sect
      (12) has discovered that Being is one and indivisible. Another (13) that
      it is infinite in number. If one (14) proclaims that all things are in a
      continual flux, another (15) replies that nothing can possibly be moved at
      any time. The theory of the universe as a process of birth and death is
      met by the counter theory, that nothing ever could be born or ever will
      die.

    <p>
      But the questioning of Socrates on the merits of these speculators
      sometimes took another form. The student of human learning expects, he
      said, to make something of his studies for the benefit of himself or
      others, as he likes. Do these explorers into the divine operations hope
      that when they have discovered by what forces the various phenomena occur,
      they will create winds and waters at will and fruitful seasons? Will they
      manipulate these and the like to suit their needs? or has no such notion
      perhaps ever entered their heads, and will they be content simply to know
      how such things come into existence? But if this was his mode of
      describing those who meddle with such matters as these, he himself never
      wearied of discussing human topics. What is piety? what is impiety? What
      is the beautiful? what the ugly? What the noble? what the base? What are
      meant by just and unjust? what by sobriety and madness? what by courage
      and cowardice? What is a state? what is a statesman? what is a ruler over
      men? what is a ruling character? and other like problems, the knowledge of
      which, as he put it, conferred a patent of nobility on the possessor, (16)
      whereas those who lacked the knowledge might deservedly be stigmatised as
      slaves.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (16) Or, "was distinctive of the 'beautiful and good.'" For the phrase
    see below, ii. 2 et passim.
</pre>
    <p>
      Now, in so far as the opinions of Socrates were unknown to the world at
      large, it is not surprising that the court should draw false conclusions
      respecting them; but that facts patent to all should have been ignored is
      indeed astonishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time Socrates was a member of the Council, (17) he had taken the
      senatorial oath, and sworn "as a member of that house to act in conformity
      with the laws." It was thus he chanced to be President of the Popular
      Assembly, (18) when that body was seized with a desire to put the nine
      (19) generals, Thrasyllus, Erasinides, and the rest, to death by a single
      inclusive vote. Whereupon, in spite of the bitter resentment of the
      people, and the menaces of several influential citizens, he refused to put
      the question, esteeming it of greater importance faithfully to abide by
      the oath which he had taken, than to gratify the people wrongfully, or to
      screen himself from the menaces of the mighty. The fact being, that with
      regard to the care bestowed by the gods upon men, his belief differed
      widely from that of the multitude. Whereas most people seem to imagine
      that the gods know in part, and are ignorant in part, Socrates believed
      firmly that the gods know all things—both the things that are said
      and the things that are done, and the things that are counselled in the
      silent chambers of the heart. Moreover, they are present everywhere, and
      bestow signs upon man concerning all the things of man.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (17) Or "Senate." Lit. "the Boule."

 (18) Lit. "Epistates of the Ecclesia." See Grote, "H. G." viii. 271;
    Plat. "Apol." 32 B.

 (19) {ennea} would seem to be a slip of the pen for {okto}, eight. See
    "Hell." I. v. 16; vi. 16; vi. 29; vii. 1 foll.
</pre>
    <p>
      I can, therefore, but repeat my former words. It is a marvel to me how the
      Athenians came to be persuaded that Socrates fell short of
      sober-mindedness as touching the gods. A man who never ventured one
      impious word or deed against the gods we worship, but whose whole language
      concerning them, and his every act, closely coincided, word for word, and
      deed for deed, with all we deem distinctive of devoutest piety.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      No less surprising to my mind is the belief that Socrates corrupted the
      young. This man, who, beyond what has been already stated, kept his
      appetites and passions under strict control, who was pre-eminently capable
      of enduring winter's cold and summer's heat and every kind of toil, who
      was so schooled to curtail his needs that with the scantiest of means he
      never lacked sufficiency—is it credible that such a man could have
      made others irreverent or lawless, or licentious, or effeminate in face of
      toil? Was he not rather the saving of many through the passion for virtue
      which he roused in them, and the hope he infused that through careful
      management of themselves they might grow to be truly beautiful and good—not
      indeed that he ever undertook to be a teacher of virtue, but being
      evidently virtuous himself he made those who associated with him hope that
      by imitating they might at last resemble him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let it not be inferred that he was negligent of his own body or
      approved of those who neglected theirs. If excess of eating, counteracted
      by excess of toil, was a dietary of which he disapproved, (1) to gratify
      the natural claim of appetite in conjunction with moderate exercise was a
      system he favoured, as tending to a healthy condition of the body without
      trammelling the cultivation of the spirit. On the other hand, there was
      nothing dandified or pretentious about him; he indulged in no foppery of
      shawl or shoes, or other effeminacy of living.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (1) See  (Plat.) "Erast." 132 C.
</pre>
    <p>
      Least of all did he tend to make his companions greedy of money. He would
      not, while restraining passion generally, make capital out of the one
      passion which attached others to himself; and by this abstinence, he
      believed, he was best consulting his own freedom; in so much that he
      stigmatised those who condescended to take wages for their society as
      vendors of their own persons, because they were compelled to discuss for
      the benefits of their paymasters. What surprised him was that any one
      possessing virtue should deign to ask money as its price instead of simply
      finding his reward in the acquisition of an honest friend, as if the
      new-fledged soul of honour could forget her debt of gratitude to her
      greatest benefactor.
    </p>
    <p>
      For himself, without making any such profession, he was content to believe
      that those who accepted his views would play their parts as good and true
      friends to himself and one another their lives long. Once more then: how
      should a man of this character corrupt the young? unless the careful
      cultivation of virtue be corruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, says the accuser, (2) by all that's sacred! did not Socrates cause
      his associates to despise the established laws when he dwelt on the folly
      of appointing state officers by ballot? (3) a principle which, he said, no
      one would care to apply in selecting a pilot or a flute-player or in any
      similar case, where a mistake would be far less disastrous than in matters
      political. Words like these, according to the accuser, tended to incite
      the young to contemn the established constitution, rendering them violent
      and headstrong. But for myself I think that those who cultivate wisdom and
      believe themselves able to instruct their fellow-citizens as to their
      interests are least likely to become partisans of violence. They are too
      well aware that to violence attach enmities and dangers, whereas results
      as good may be obtained by persuasion safely and amicably. For the victim
      of violence hates with vindictiveness as one from whom something precious
      has been stolen, while the willing subject of persuasion is ready to kiss
      the hand which has done him a service. Hence compulsion is not the method
      of him who makes wisdom his study, but of him who wields power untempered
      by reflection. Once more: the man who ventures on violence needs the
      support of many to fight his battles, while he whose strength lies in
      persuasiveness triumphs single-handed, for he is conscious of a cunning to
      compel consent unaided. And what has such a one to do with the spilling of
      blood? since how ridiculous it were to do men to death rather than turn to
      account the trusty service of the living.

      But, the accuser answers, the two men (4) who wrought the greatest evils
      to the state at any time—to wit, Critias and Alcibiades—were
      both companions of Socrates—Critias the oligarch, and Alcibiades the
      democrat. Where would you find a more arrant thief, savage, and murderer
      (5) than the one? where such a portent of insolence, incontinence, and
      high-handedness as the other? For my part, in so far as these two wrought
      evil to the state, I have no desire to appear as the apologist of either.
      I confine myself to explaining what this intimacy of theirs with Socrates
      really was.

      Never were two more ambitious citizens seen at Athens. Ambition was in
      their blood. If they were to have their will, all power was to be in their
      hands; their fame was to eclipse all other. Of Socrates they knew—first
      that he lived an absolutely independent life on the scantiest means; next
      that he was self-disciplined to the last degree in respect of pleasures;
      lastly that he was so formidable in debate that there was no antagonist he
      could not twist round his little finger. Such being their views, and such
      the character of the pair, which is the more probable: that they sought
      the society of Socrates because they felt the fascination of his life, and
      were attracted by the bearing of the man? or because they thought, if only
      we are leagued with him we shall become adepts in statecraft and
      unrivalled in the arts of speech and action? For my part I believe that if
      the choice from Heaven had been given them to live such a life as they saw
      Socrates living to its close, or to die, they would both have chosen
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their acts are a conclusive witness to their characters. They no sooner
      felt themselves to be the masters of those they came in contact with than
      they sprang aside from Socrates and plunged into that whirl of politics
      but for which they might never have sought his society.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be objected: before giving his companions lessons in politics
      Socrates had better have taught them sobriety. (6) Without disputing the
      principle, I would point out that a teacher cannot fail to discover to his
      pupils his method of carrying out his own precepts, and this along with
      argumentative encouragement. Now I know that Socrates disclosed himself to
      his companions as a beautiful and noble being, who would reason and debate
      with them concerning virtue and other human interests in the noblest
      manner. And of these two I know that as long as they were companions of
      Socrates even they were temperate, not assuredly from fear of being fined
      or beaten by Socrates, but because they were persuaded for the nonce of
      the excellence of such conduct.

      Perhaps some self-styled philosophers (7) may here answer: "Nay, the man
      truly just can never become unjust, the temperate man can never become
      intemperate, the man who has learnt any subject of knowledge can never be
      as though he had learnt it not." That, however, is not my own conclusion.
      It is with the workings of the soul as with those of the body; want of
      exercise of the organ leads to inability of function, here bodily, there
      spiritual, so that we can neither do the things that we should nor abstain
      from the things we should not. And that is why fathers keep their sons,
      however temperate they may be, out of the reach of wicked men, considering
      that if the society of the good is a training in virtue so also is the
      society of the bad its dissolution.

      To this the poet (8) is a witness, who says:

<pre xml:space="preserve">    "But the good man has his hour of baseness as well as his hour of
    virtue"—
</pre>
    <p>
      to whose testimony I would add my own. For I see that it is impossible to
      remember a long poem without practice and repetition; so is forgetfulness
      of the words of instruction engendered in the heart that has ceased to
      value them. With the words of warning fades the recollection of the very
      condition of mind in which the soul yearned after holiness; and once
      forgetting this, what wonder that the man should let slip also the memory
      of virtue itself! Again I see that a man who falls into habits of
      drunkenness or plunges headlong into licentious love, loses his old power
      of practising the right and abstaining from the wrong. Many a man who has
      found frugality easy whilst passion was cold, no sooner falls in love than
      he loses the faculty at once, and in his prodigal expenditure of riches he
      will no longer withhold his hand from gains which in former days were too
      base to invite his touch. Where then is the difficulty of supposing that a
      man may be temperate to-day, and to-morrow the reverse; or that he who
      once has had it in his power to act virtuously may not quite lose that
      power? (10) To myself, at all events, it seems that all beautiful and
      noble things are the result of constant practice and training; and
      pre-eminently the virtue of temperance, seeing that in one and the same
      bodily frame pleasures are planted and spring up side by side with the
      soul and keep whispering in her ear, "Have done with self-restraint, make
      haste to gratify us and the body." (11)

      But to return to Critias and Alcibiades, I repeat that as long as they
      lived with Socrates they were able by his support to dominate their
      ignoble appetites; (12) but being separated from him, Critias had to fly
      to Thessaly, (13) where he consorted with fellows better versed in
      lawlessness than justice. And Alcibiades fared no better. His personal
      beauty on the one hand incited bevies of fine ladies (14) to hunt him down
      as fair spoil, while on the other hand his influence in the state and
      among the allies exposed him to the corruption of many an adept in the
      arts of flattery; honoured by the democracy and stepping easily to the
      front rank he behaved like an athlete who in the games of the Palaestra is
      so assured of victory that he neglects his training; thus he presently
      forgot the duty which he owed himself.

    <p>
      Such were the misadventures of these two. Is the sequel extraordinary?
      Inflated with the pride of ancestry, (15) exalted by their wealth, puffed
      up by power, sapped to the soul's core by a host of human tempters,
      separate moreover for many a long day from Socrates—what wonder that
      they reached the full stature of arrogancy! And for the offences of these
      two Socrates is to be held responsible! The accuser will have it so. But
      for the fact that in early days, when they were both young and of an age
      when dereliction from good feeling and self-restraint might have been
      expected, this same Socrates kept them modest and well-behaved, not one
      word of praise is uttered by the accuser for all this. That is not the
      measure of justice elsewhere meted. Would a master of the harp or flute,
      would a teacher of any sort who has turned out proficient pupils, be held
      to account because one of them goes away to another teacher and turns out
      to be a failure? Or what father, if he have a son who in the society of a
      certain friend remains an honest lad, but falling into the company of some
      other becomes a good-for-nothing, will that father straightway accuse the
      earlier instructor? Will not he rather, in proportion as the boy
      deteriorates in the company of the latter, bestow more heartfelt praise
      upon the former? What father, himself sharing the society of his own
      children, is held to blame for their transgressions, if only his own
      goodness be established? Here would have been a fair test to apply to
      Socrates: Was he guilty of any base conduct himself? If so let him be set
      down as a knave, but if, on the contrary, he never faltered in sobriety
      from beginning to end, how in the name of justice is he to be held to
      account for a baseness which was not in him?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (15) Or, "became overweening in arrogance." Cf. "Henry VIII. II. iv.
    110": "But your heart is crammed with arrogancy, spleen, and
    pride."
</pre>
    <p>
      I go further: if, short of being guilty of any wrong himself, he saw the
      evil doings of others with approval, reason were he should be held
      blameworthy. Listen then: Socrates was well aware that Critias was
      attached to Euthydemus, (16) aware too that he was endeavouring to deal by
      him after the manner of those wantons whose love is carnal of the body.
      From this endeavour he tried to deter him, pointing out how illiberal a
      thing it was, how ill befitting a man of honour to appear as a beggar
      before him whom he loved, in whose eyes he would fain be precious, ever
      petitioning for something base to give and base to get.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (16) See below, IV. ii. 1 (if the same person).
</pre>
    <p>
      But when this reasoning fell on deaf ears and Critias refused to be turned
      aside, Socrates, as the story goes, took occasion of the presence of a
      whole company and of Euthydemus to remark that Critias appeared to be
      suffering from a swinish affection, or else why this desire to rub himself
      against Euthydemus like a herd of piglings scraping against stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hatred of Critias to Socrates doubtless dates from this incident. He
      treasured it up against him, and afterwards, when he was one of the Thirty
      and associated with Charicles as their official lawgiver, (17) he framed
      the law against teaching the art of words (18) merely from a desire to
      vilify Socrates. He was at a loss to know how else to lay hold of him
      except by levelling against him the vulgar charge (19) against
      philosophers, by which he hoped to prejudice him with the public. It was a
      charge quite unfounded as regards Socrates, if I may judge from anything I
      ever heard fall from his lips myself or have learnt about him from others.
      But the animus of Critias was clear. At the time when the Thirty were
      putting citizens, highly respectable citizens, to death wholesale, and
      when they were egging on one man after another to the commission of crime,
      Socrates let fall an observation: "It would be sufficiently extraordinary
      if the keeper of a herd of cattle (20) who was continually thinning and
      impoverishing his cattle did not admit himself to be a sorry sort of
      herdsman, but that a ruler of the state who was continually thinning and
      impoverishing the citizens should neither be ashamed nor admit himself to
      be a sorry sort of ruler was more extraordinary still." The remark being
      reported to the government, Socrates was summoned by Critias and
      Charicles, who proceeded to point out the law and forbade him to converse
      with the young. "Was it open to him," Socrates inquired of the speaker,
      "in case he failed to understand their commands in any point, to ask for
      an explanation?"

      "Certainly," the two assented.

      Then Socrates: I am prepared to obey the laws, but to avoid transgression
      of the law through ignorance I need instruction: is it on the supposition
      that the art of words tends to correctness of statement or to
      incorrectness that you bid us abstain from it? for if the former, it is
      clear we must abstain from speaking correctly, but if the latter, our
      endeavour should be to amend our speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which Charicles, in a fit of temper, retorted: In consideration of your
      ignorance, (21) Socrates, we will frame the prohibition in language better
      suited to your intelligence: we forbid you to hold any conversation
      whatsoever with the young.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (21) See Aristot. "de Soph. El." 183 b7.

      Then Socrates: To avoid all ambiguity then, or the possibility of my doing
      anything else than what you are pleased to command, may I ask you to
      define up to what age a human being is to be considered young?
    </p>
    <p>
      For just so long a time (Charicles answered) as he is debarred from
      sitting as a member of the Council, (22) as not having attained to the
      maturity of wisdom; accordingly you will not hold converse with any one
      under the age of thirty.

      Cha. Tut, things of that sort: but you know, Socrates, that you have a way
      of asking questions, when all the while you know how the matter stands.
      Let us have no questions of that sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Nor answers either, I suppose, if the inquiry concerns what I know,
      as, for instance, where does Charicles live? or where is Critias to be
      found?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, of course, things of that kind (replied Charicles), while Critias
      added: But at the same time you had better have done with your shoemakers,
      carpenters, and coppersmiths. (23) These must be pretty well trodden out
      at heel by this time, considering the circulation you have given them.

      Most assuredly (answered Charicles), and from cowherds in particular; or
      else see that you do not lessen the number of the herd yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the secret was out. The remark of Socrates about the cattle had come
      to their ears, and they could not forgive the author of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps enough has been said to explain the kind of intimacy which had
      subsisted between Critias and Socrates, and their relation to one another.
      But I will venture to maintain that where the teacher is not pleasing to
      the pupil there is no education. Now it cannot be said of Critias and
      Alcibiades that they associated with Socrates because they found him
      pleasing to them. And this is true of the whole period. From the first
      their eyes were fixed on the headship of the state as their final goal.
      During the time of their intimacy with Socrates there were no disputants
      whom they were more eager to encounter than professed politicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the story is told of Alcibiades—how before the age of twenty he
      engaged his own guardian, Pericles, at that time prime minister of the
      state, in a discussion concerning laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alc. Please, Pericles, can you teach me what a law is?
    </p>
    <p>
      Per. To be sure I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alc. I should be so much obliged if you would do so. One so often hears
      the epithet "law-abiding" applied in a complimentary sense; yet, it
      strikes me, one hardly deserves the compliment, if one does not know what
      a law is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Per. Fortunately there is a ready answer to your difficulty. You wish to
      know what a law is? Well, those are laws which the majority, being met
      together in conclave, approve and enact as to what it is right to do, and
      what it is right to abstain from doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alc. Enact on the hypothesis that it is right to do what is good? or to do
      what is bad?
    </p>
    <p>
      Per. What is good, to be sure, young sir, not what is bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alc. Supposing it is not the majority, but, as in the case of an
      oligarchy, the minority, who meet and enact the rules of conduct, what are
      these?
    </p>
    <p>
      Per. Whatever the ruling power of the state after deliberation enacts as
      our duty to do, goes by the name of laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alc. Then if a tyrant, holding the chief power in the state, enacts rules
      of conduct for the citizens, are these enactments law?
    </p>
    <p>
      Per. Yes, anything which a tyrant as head of the state enacts, also goes
      by the name of law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alc. But, Pericles, violence and lawlessness—how do we define them?
      Is it not when a stronger man forces a weaker to do what seems right to
      him—not by persuasion but by compulsion?
    </p>
    <p>
      Per. I should say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alc. It would seem to follow that if a tyrant, without persuading the
      citizens, drives them by enactment to do certain things—that is
      lawlessness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Per. You are right; and I retract the statement that measures passed by a
      tyrant without persuasion of the citizens are law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alc. And what of measures passed by a minority, not by persuasion of the
      majority, but in the exercise of its power only? Are we, or are we not, to
      apply the term violence to these?
    </p>
    <p>
      Per. I think that anything which any one forces another to do without
      persuasion, whether by enactment or not, is violence rather than law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alc. It would seem that everything which the majority, in the exercise of
      its power over the possessors of wealth, and without persuading them,
      chooses to enact, is of the nature of violence rather than of law?
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure (answered Pericles), adding: At your age we were clever hands
      at such quibbles ourselves. It was just such subtleties which we used to
      practise our wits upon; as you do now, if I mistake not.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which Alcibiades replied: Ah, Pericles, I do wish we could have met in
      those days when you were at your cleverest in such matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, then, as soon as the desired superiority over the politicians of the
      day seemed to be attained, Critias and Alcibiades turned their backs on
      Socrates. They found his society unattractive, not to speak of the
      annoyance of being cross-questioned on their own shortcomings. Forthwith
      they devoted themselves to those affairs of state but for which they would
      never have come near him at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; if one would seek to see true companions of Socrates, one must look to
      Crito, (24) and Chaerephon, and Chaerecrates, to Hermogenes, to Simmias
      and Cebes, to Phaedondes and others, who clung to him not to excel in the
      rhetoric of the Assembly or the law-courts, but with the nobler ambition
      of attaining to such beauty and goodliness of soul as would enable them to
      discharge the various duties of life to house and family, to relatives and
      friends, to fellow-citizens, and to the state at large. Of these true
      followers not one in youth or old age was ever guilty, or thought guilty,
      of committing any evil deed.

      "But for all that," the accuser insists, "Socrates taught sons to pour

      could make them wiser than their sires, or by pointing out that the law
      allowed a son to sue his father for aberration of mind, and to imprison
      him, which legal ordinance he put in evidence to prove that it might be
      well for the wiser to imprison the more ignorant."

      Now what Socrates held was, that if a man may with justice incarcerate
      another for no better cause than a form of folly or ignorance, this same
      person could not justly complain if he in his turn were kept in bonds by
      his superiors in knowledge; and to come to the bottom of such questions,
      to discover the difference between madness and ignorance was a problem
      which he was perpetually working at. His opinion came to this: If a madman
      may, as a matter of expediency to himself and his friends, be kept in
      prison, surely, as a matter of justice, the man who knows not what he
      ought to know should be content to sit at the feet of those who know, and
      be taught.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was the rest of their kith and kin, not fathers only (according to
      the accuser), whom Socrates dishonoured in the eyes of his circle of
      followers, when he said that "the sick man or the litigant does not derive
      assistance from his relatives, (26) but from his doctor in the one case,
      and his legal adviser in the other." "Listen further to his language about
      friends," says the accuser: "'What is the good of their being kindly
      disposed, unless they can be of some practical use to you? Mere goodness
      of disposition is nothing; those only are worthy of honour who combine
      with the knowledge of what is right the faculty of expounding it;' (27)
      and so by bringing the young to look upon himself as a superlatively wise
      person gifted with an extraordinary capacity for making others wise also,
      he so worked on the dispositions of those who consorted with him that in
      their esteem the rest of the world counted for nothing by comparison with
      Socrates."

</pre>
    <p>
      Now I admit the language about fathers and the rest of a man's relations.
      I can go further, and add some other sayings of his, that "when the soul
      (which is alone the indwelling centre of intelligence) is gone out of a
      man, be he our nearest and dearest friend, we carry the body forth and
      bury it out of sight." "Even in life," he used to say, "each of us is
      ready to part with any portion of his best possession—to wit, his
      own body—if it be useless and unprofitable. He will remove it
      himself, or suffer another to do so in his stead. Thus men cut off their
      own nails, hair, or corns; they allow surgeons to cut and cauterise them,
      not without pains and aches, and are so grateful to the doctor for his
      services that they further give him a fee. Or again, a man ejects the
      spittle from his mouth as far as possible. (28) Why? Because it is of no
      use while it stays within the system, but is detrimental rather."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (28) See Aristot. "Eth. Eud." vii. 1.
</pre>
    <p>
      Now by these instances his object was not to inculcate the duty of burying
      one's father alive or of cutting oneself to bits, but to show that lack of
      intelligence means lack of worth; (29) and so he called upon his hearers
      to be as sensible and useful as they could be, so that, be it father or
      brother or any one else whose esteem he would deserve, a man should not
      hug himself in careless self-interest, trusting to mere relationship, but
      strive to be useful to those whose esteem he coveted.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (29) i.e. "witless and worthless are synonymous."
</pre>
    <p>
      But (pursues the accuser) by carefully culling the most immoral passages
      of the famous poets, and using them as evidences, he taught his associates
      to be evildoers and tyrranical: the line of Hesiod (30) for instance—
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">    No work is a disgrace; slackness of work is the disgrace—
</pre>
    <p>
      "interpreted," says the accuser, "by Socrates as if the poet enjoined us
      to abstain from no work wicked or ignoble; do everything for the sake of
      gain."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (30) "Works and Days," 309 {'Ergon d' ouden oneidos}. Cf. Plat.
    "Charm." 163 C.
</pre>
    <p>
      Now while Socrates would have entirely admitted the propositions that "it
      is a blessing and a benefit to a man to be a worker," and that "a lazy
      do-nothing is a pestilent evil," that "work is good and idleness a curse,"
      the question arises, whom did he mean by workers? In his vocabulary only
      those were good workmen (31) who were engaged on good work; dicers and
      gamblers and others engaged on any other base and ruinous business he
      stigmatised as the "idle drones"; and from this point of view the
      quotation from Hesiod is unimpeachable—
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">    No work is a disgrace; only idlesse is disgrace.
</pre>
    <p>
      But there was a passage from Homer (32) for ever on his lips, as the
      accuser tells us—the passage which says concerning Odysseus,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">    What prince, or man of name,
    He found flight-giv'n, he would restrain with words of gentlest blame:
    "Good sir, it fits you not to fly, or fare as one afraid,
    You should not only stay yourself, but see the people stayed."

     Thus he the best sort us'd; the worst, whose spirits brake out in
     noise, (33) He cudgell'd with his sceptre, chid, and said, "Stay,
     wretch, be still, And hear thy betters; thou art base, and both in
     power and skill Poor and unworthy, without name in counsel or in
     war." We must not all be kings.

    shouting."—W. Leaf.
</pre>
    <p>
      The accuser informs us that Socrates interpreted these lines as though the
      poet approved the giving of blows to commoners and poor folk. Now no such
      remark was ever made by Socrates; which indeed would have been tantamount
      to maintaining that he ought to be beaten himself. What he did say was,
      that those who were useful neither in word nor deed, who were incapable of
      rendering assistance in time of need to the army or the state or the
      people itself, be they never so wealthy, ought to be restrained, and
      especially if to incapacity they added effrontery.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Socrates, he was the very opposite of all this—he was plainly
      a lover of the people, and indeed of all mankind. Though he had many
      ardent admirers among citizens and strangers alike, he never demanded any
      fee for his society from any one, (34) but bestowed abundantly upon all
      alike of the riches of his soul—good things, indeed, of which
      fragments accepted gratis at his hands were taken and sold at high prices
      to the rest of the community by some, (35) who were not, as he was, lovers
      of the people, since with those who had not money to give in return they
      refused to discourse. But of Socrates be it said that in the eyes of the
      whole world he reflected more honour on the state and a richer lustre than
      ever Lichas, (36) whose fame is proverbial, shed on Lacedaemon. Lichas
      feasted and entertained the foreign residents in Lacedaemon at the
      Gymnopaediae most handsomely. Socrates gave a lifetime to the outpouring
      of his substance in the shape of the greatest benefits bestowed on all who
      cared to receive them. In other words, he made those who lived in his
      society better men, and sent them on their way rejoicing.

</pre>
    <p>
      To no other conclusion, therefore, can I come but that, being so good a
      man, Socrates was worthier to have received honour from the state than
      death. And this I take to be the strictly legal view of the case, for what
      does the law require? (37) "If a man be proved to be a thief, a filcher of
      clothes, a cut-purse, a housebreaker, a man-stealer, a robber of temples,
      the penalty is death." Even so; and of all men Socrates stood most aloof
      from such crimes.

    <p>
      To the state he was never the cause of any evil—neither disaster in
      war, nor faction, nor treason, nor any other mischief whatsoever. And if
      his public life was free from all offence, so was his private. He never
      hurt a single soul either by deprivation of good or infliction of evil,
      nor did he ever lie under the imputation of any of those misdoings. where
      then is his liability to the indictment to be found? Who, so far from
      disbelieving in the gods, as set forth in the indictment, was conspicuous
      beyond all men for service to heaven; so far from corrupting the young—a
      charge alleged with insistence by the prosecutor—was notorious for
      the zeal with which he strove not only to stay his associates from evil
      desires, but to foster in them a passionate desire for that loveliest and
      queenliest of virtues without which states and families crumble to decay.
      (38) Such being his conduct, was he not worthy of high honour from the
      state of Athens?

      It may serve to illustrate the assertion that he benefited his associates
      partly by the display of his own virtue and partly by verbal discourse and
      argument, if I set down my various recollections (1) on these heads. And
      first with regard to religion and the concerns of heaven. In conduct and
      language his behaviour conformed to the rule laid down by the Pythia (2)
      in reply to the question, "How shall we act?" as touching a sacrifice or
      the worship of ancestors, or any similar point. Her answer is: "Act
      according to the law and custom of your state, and you will act piously."
      After this pattern Socrates behaved himself, and so he exhorted others to
      behave, holding them to be but busybodies and vain fellows who acted on
      any different principle.

      His formula or prayer was simple: "Give me that which is best for me,"
      for, said he, the gods know best what good things are—to pray for
      gold or silver or despotic power were no better than to make some
      particular throw at dice or stake in battle or any such thing the subject
      of prayer, of which the future consequences are manifestly uncertain. (3)

      If with scant means he offered but small sacrifices he believed that he
      was in no wise inferior to those who make frequent and large sacrifices
      from an ampler store. It were ill surely for the very gods themselves,
      could they take delight in large sacrifices rather than in small, else
      oftentimes must the offerings of bad men be found acceptable rather than
      of good; nor from the point of view of men themselves would life be worth
      living if the offerings of a villain rather than of a righteous man found
      favour in the sight of Heaven. His belief was that the joy of the gods is
      greater in proportion to the holiness of the giver, and he was ever an
      admirer of that line of Hesiod which says,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">    According to thine ability do sacrifice to the immortal gods. (4)

      "Yes," he would say, "in our dealings with friends and strangers alike,
      and in reference to the demands of life in general, there is no better
      motto for a man than that: 'let a man do according to his ability.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Or to take another point. If it appeared to him that a sign from heaven
      had been given him, nothing would have induced him to go against heavenly
      warning: he would as soon have been persuaded to accept the guidance of a
      blind man ignorant of the path to lead him on a journey in place of one
      who knew the road and could see; and so he denounced the folly of others
      who do things contrary to the warnings of God in order to avoid some
      disrepute among men. For himself he despised all human aids by comparison
      with counsel from above.
    </p>
    <p>
      The habit and style of living to which he subjected his soul and body was
      one which under ordinary circumstances (5) would enable any one adopting
      it to look existence cheerily in the face and to pass his days serenely:
      it would certainly entail no difficulties as regards expense. So frugal
      was it that a man must work little indeed who could not earn the quantum
      which contented Socrates. Of food he took just enough to make eating a
      pleasure—the appetite he brought to it was sauce sufficient; while
      as to drinks, seeing that he only drank when thirsty, any draught
      refreshed. (6) If he accepted an invitation to dinner, he had no
      difficulty in avoiding the common snare of over-indulgence, and his advice
      to people who could not equally control their appetite was to avoid taking
      what would allure them to eat if not hungry or to drink if not thirsty.
      (7) Such things are ruinous to the constitution, he said, bad for
      stomachs, brains, and soul alike; or as he used to put it, with a touch of
      sarcasm, (8) "It must have been by feasting men on so many dainty dishes
      that Circe produced her pigs; only Odysseus through his continency and the
      'promptings (9) of Hermes' abstained from touching them immoderately, and
      by the same token did not turn into a swine." So much for this topic,
      which he touched thus lightly and yet seriously.

      from the fascination of fair forms: once lay finger on these and it is not

      was a mere kiss which, as he had heard, Critobulus (10) had some time
      given to a fair youth, the son of Alcibiades. (11) Accordingly Critobulus
      being present, Socrates propounded the question.

      could well encounter myself.

      Soc. Poor soul! and what do you expect your fate to be after that kiss?
      Let me tell you. On the instant you will lose your freedom, the indenture
      of your bondage will be signed; it will be yours on compulsion to spend
      large sums on hurtful pleasures; you will have scarcely a moment's leisure
      left for any noble study; you will be driven to concern yourself most

      not know that this wild beast which men call beauty in its bloom is all
      the more terrible than the tarantula in that the insect must first touch
      its victim, but this at a mere glance of the beholder, without even
      contact, will inject something into him—yards away—which will
      make him man. And may be that is why the Loves are called "archers,"
      because these beauties wound so far off. (14) But my advice to you,
      Xenophon, is, whenever you catch sight of one of these fair forms, to run
      helter-skelter for bare life without a glance behind; and to you,
      Critobulus, I would say, "Go abroad for a year: so long time will it take
      to heal you of this wound."

      Such (he said), in the affairs of Aphrodite, as in meats and drinks,

      with, save for some necessity of the body; and which even so ought to set
      up no disturbance. (15) But for himself, it was clear, he was prepared at

      beauty's fairest and fullest bloom than many others from weeds and
      garbage. To sum up: (16) with regard to eating and drinking and these
      other temptations of the sense, the equipment of his soul made him
      independent; he could boast honestly that in his moderate fashion (17) his

      A belief is current, in accordance with views maintained concerning
      Socrates in speech and writing, and in either case conjecturally, that,
      however powerful he may have been in stimulating men to virtue as a
      theorist, he was incapable of acting as their guide himself. (1) It would
      be well for those who adopt this view to weigh carefully not only what
      Socrates effected "by way of castigation" in cross-questioning whose who
      conceived themselves to be possessed of all knowledge, but also his
      everyday conversation with those who spent their time in close intercourse
      with himself. Having done this, let them decide whether he was incapable
      of making his companions better.

    guide ({proagein}) his hearers on the true path himself." Cf.

      Soc. Does it not strike you then that he who made man from the beginning
      (5) did for some useful end furnish him with his several senses—giving
      him eyes to behold the visible word, and ears to catch the intonations of
      sound? Or again, what good would there be in odours if nostrils had not
      been bestowed upon us? what perception of sweet things and pungent, and of
      all the pleasures of the palate, had not a tongue been fashioned in us as
      an interpreter of the same? And besides all this, do you not think this
      looks like a matter of foresight, this closing of the delicate orbs of
      sight with eyelids as with folding doors, which, when there is need to use
      them for any purpose, can be thrown wide open and firmly closed again in
      sleep? and, that even the winds of heaven may not visit them too roughly,
      this planting of the eyelashes as a protecting screen? (6) this coping of
      the region above the eyes with cornice-work of eyebrow so that no drop of
      sweat fall from the head and injure them? again this readiness of the ear
      to catch all sounds and yet not to be surcharged? this capacity of the
      front teeth of all animals to cut and of the "grinders" to receive the
      food and reduce it to pulp? the position of the mouth again, close to the
      eyes and nostrils as a portal of ingress for all the creature's supplies?
      and lastly, seeing that matter passing out (7) of the body is unpleasant,
      this hindward direction of the passages, and their removal to a distance
      from the avenues of sense? I ask you, when you see all these things
      constructed with such show of foresight can you doubt whether they are
      products of chance or intelligence?

      Soc. How can you suppose that they do not so take thought? Who, in the
      first place, gave to man alone of living creatures his erect posture,
      enabling him to see farther in front of him and to contemplate more freely
      the height above, and to be less subject to distress than other creatures
      (endowed like himself with eyes and ears and mouth). (12) Consider next
      how they gave to the beast of the field (13) feet as a means of
      progression only, but to man they gave in addition hands—those hands
      which have achieved so much to raise us in the scale of happiness above
      all animals. Did they not make the tongue also? which belongs indeed alike
      to man and beast, but in man they fashioned it so as to play on different
      parts of the mouth at different times, whereby we can produce articulate
      speech, and have a code of signals to express our every want to one
      another. Or consider the pleasures of the sexual appetite; limited in the
      rest of the animal kingdom to certain seasons, but in the case of man a
      series prolonged unbroken to old age. Nor did it content the Godhead
      merely to watch over the interests of man's body. What is of far higher
      import, he implanted in man the noblest and most excellent type of soul.
      For what other creature, to begin with, has a soul to appreciate the
      existence of the gods who have arranged this grand and beauteous universe?
      What other tribe of animals save man can render service to the gods? How
      apt is the spirit of man to take precautions against hunger and thirst,
      cold and heat, to alleviate disease and foster strength! how suited to
      labour with a view to learning! how capable of garnering in the storehouse
      of his memory all that he has heard or seen or understood! Is it not most
      evident to you that by the side of other animals men live and move a race
      of gods—by nature excellent, in beauty of body and of soul supreme?
      For, mark you, had a creature of man's wit been encased in the body of an
      ox, (14) he would have been powerless to carry out his wishes, just as the
      possession of hands divorced from human wit is profitless. And then you
      come, you who have obtained these two most precious attributes, and give
      it as your opinion, that the gods take no thought or care for you. Why,
      what will you have them to do, that you may believe and be persuaded that
      you too are in their thoughts?

      suppose that the gods could have implanted in the heart of man the belief
      in their capacity to work him weal or woe had they not the power? Would
      not men have discovered the imposture in all this lapse of time? Do you
      not perceive that the wisest and most perdurable of human institutions—be
      they cities or tribes of men—are ever the most God-fearing; and in
      the individual man the riper his age and judgment, the deeper his
      religousness? Ay, my good sir (he broke forth), lay to heart and
      understand that even as your own mind within you can turn and dispose of
      your body as it lists, so ought we to think that the wisdom which abides
      within the universal frame does so dispose of all things as it finds
      agreeable to itself; for hardly may it be that your eye is able to range
      over many a league, but that the eye of God is powerless to embrace all
      things at a glance; or that to your soul it is given to dwell in thought
      on matters here or far away in Egypt or in Sicily, but that the wisdom and
      thought of God is not sufficient to include all things at one instant
      under His care. If only you would copy your own behaviour (16) where human
      beings are concerned. It is by acts of service and of kindness that you
      discover which of your fellows are willing to requite you in kind. It is
      by taking another into your counsel that you arrive at the secret of his
      wisdom. If, on like principle, you will but make trial of the gods by acts
      of service, whether they will choose to give you counsel in matters
      obscure to mortal vision, you shall discover the nature and the greatness
      of Godhead to be such that they are able at once to see all things and to
      hear all things and to be present everywhere, nor does the least thing
      escape their watchful care.

      To my mind the effect of words like these was to cause those about him to

      I suppose it may be taken as admitted that self-control is a noble
      acquirement for a man. (1) If so, let us turn and consider whether by
      language like the following he was likely to lead his listeners onwards
      (2) to the attainment of this virtue. "Sirs," he would say, "if a war came
      upon us and we wished to choose a man who would best help us to save
      ourselves and to subdue our enemy, I suppose we should scarcely select one
      whom we knew to be a slave to his belly, to wine, or lust, and prone to
      succumb to toil or sleep. Could we expect such an one to save us or to
      master our foes? Or if one of us were nearing the end of his days, and he
      wished to discover some one to whom he might entrust his sons for
      education, his maiden daughters for protection, and his property in
      general for preservation, would he deem a libertine worthy of such
      offices? Why, no one would dream of entrusting his flocks and herds, his
      storehouses and barns, or the superintendence of his works to the tender
      mercies of an intemperate slave. If a butler or an errand boy with such a
      character were offered to us we would not take him as a free gift. And if
      he would not accept an intemperate slave, what pains should the master
      himself take to avoid that imputation. (3) For with the incontinent man it
      is not as with the self-seeker and the covetous. These may at any rate be
      held to enrich themselves in depriving others. But the intemperate man
      cannot claim in like fashion to be a blessing to himself if a curse to his
      neighbours; nay, the mischief which he may cause to others is nothing by
      comparison with that which redounds against himself, since it is the
      height of mischief to ruin—I do not say one's own house and property—but
      one's own body and one's own soul. Or to take an example from social
      intercourse, no one cares for a guest who evidently takes more pleasure in
      the wine and the viands than in the friends beside him—who stints
      his comrades of the affection due to them to dote upon a mistress. Does it
      not come to this, that every honest man is bound to look upon
      self-restraint as the very corner-stone of virtue: (4) which he should
      seek to lay down as the basis and foundation of his soul? Without
      self-restraint who can lay any good lesson to heart or practise it when
      learnt in any degree worth speaking of? Or, to put it conversely, what
      slave of pleasure will not suffer degeneracy of soul and body? By Hera,
      (5) well may every free man pray to be saved from the service of such a
      slave; and well too may he who is in bondage to such pleasures supplicate
      Heaven to send him good masters, seeing that is the one hope of salvation
      left him."

      Well-tempered words: yet his self-restraint shone forth even more in his
      acts than in his language. Not only was he master over the pleasures which
      flow from the body, but of those also which are fed by riches, his belief
      being that he who receives money from this or that chance donor sets up
      over himself a master, and binds himself to an abominable slavery.

      In this context some discussions with Antiphon the sophist (1) deserve
      record. Antiphon approaches Socrates in hope of drawing away his
      associates, and in their presence thus accosts him.

    <p>
      Antiphon. Why, Socrates, I always thought it was expected of students of
      philosophy to grow in happiness daily; but you seem to have reaped other
      fruits from your philosophy. At any rate, you exist, I do not say live, in
      a style such as no slave serving under a master would put up with. Your
      meat and your drink are of the cheapest sort, and as to clothes, you cling
      to one wretched cloak which serves you for summer and winter alike; and so
      you go the whole year round, without shoes to your feet or a shirt to your
      back. Then again, you are not for taking or making money, the mere seeking
      of which is a pleasure, even as the possession of it adds to the sweetness
      and independence of existence. I do not know whether you follow the common
      rule of teachers, who try to fashion their pupils in imitation of
      themselves, (2) and propose to mould the characters of your companions;
      but if you do you ought to dub yourself professor of the art of
      wretchedness. (3)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (2) Or, "try to turn out their pupils as copies of themselves."

 (3) See Arist. "Clouds," {on o kakodaimon Sokrates kai Khairephon}.
</pre>
    <p>
      Thus challenged, Socrates replied: One thing to me is certain, Antiphon;
      you have conceived so vivid an idea of my life of misery that for yourself
      you would choose death sooner than live as I do. Suppose now we turn and
      consider what it is you find so hard in my life. Is it that he who takes
      payment must as a matter of contract finish the work for which he is paid,
      whereas I, who do not take it, lie under no constraint to discourse except
      with whom I choose? Do you despise my dietary on the ground that the food
      which I eat is less wholesome and less stengthening than yours, or that
      the articles of my consumption are so scarce and so much costlier to
      procure than yours? Or have the fruits of your marketing a flavour denied
      to mine? Do you not know the sharper the appetite the less the need of
      sauces, the keener the thirst the less the desire for out-of-the-way
      drinks? And as to raiment, clothes, you know, are changed on account of
      cold or else of heat. People only wear boots and shoes in order not to
      gall their feet and be prevented walking. Now I ask you, have you ever
      noticed that I keep more within doors than others on account of the cold?
      Have you ever seen me battling with any one for shade on account of the
      heat? Do you not know that even a weakling by nature may, by dint of
      exercise and practice, come to outdo a giant who neglects his body? He
      will beat him in the particular point of training, and bear the strain
      more easily. But you apparently will not have it that I, who am for ever
      training myself to endure this, that, and the other thing which may befall
      the body, can brave all hardships more easily than yourself for instance,
      who perhaps are not so practised. And to escape slavery to the belly or to
      sleep or lechery, can you suggest more effective means than the possession
      of some powerful attraction, some counter-charm which shall gladden not
      only in the using, but by the hope enkindled of its lasting usefulness?
      And yet this you do know; joy is not to him who feels that he is doing
      well in nothing—it belongs to one who is persuaded that things are
      progressing with him, be it tillage or the working of a vessel, (4) or any
      of the thousand and one things on which a man may chance to be employed.
      To him it is given to rejoice as he reflects, "I am doing well." But is
      the pleasured derived from all these put together half as joyous as the
      consciousness of becoming better oneself, of acquiring better and better
      friends? That, for my part, is the belief I continue to cherish.

<pre xml:space="preserve"> (4) "The business of a shipowner or skipper."

      Again, if it be a question of helping one's friends or country, which of
      the two will have the larger leisure to devote to these objects—he
      who leads the life which I lead to-day, or he who lives in the style which
      you deem so fortunate? Which of the two will adopt a soldier's life more
      easily—the man who cannot get on without expensive living, or he to
      whom whatever comes to hand suffices? Which will be the readier to
      capitulate and cry "mercy" in a siege—the man of elaborate wants, or
      he who can get along happily with the readiest things to hand? You,
      Antiphon, would seem to suggest that happiness consists of luxury and
      extravagance; I hold a different creed. To have no wants at all is, to my
      mind, an attribute of Godhead; (5) to have as few wants as possible the
      nearest approach to Godhead; and as that which is divine is mightiest, so
      that is next mightiest which comes closest to the divine.

      Returning to the charge at another time, this same Antiphon engaged
      Socrates in conversation thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ant. Socrates, for my part, I believe you to be a good and upright man;
      but for your wisdom I cannot say much. I fancy you would hardly dispute
      the verdict yourself, since, as I remark, you do not ask a money payment
      for your society; and yet if it were your cloak now, or your house, or any
      other of your possessions, you would set some value upon it, and never
      dream, I will not say of parting with it gratis, but of exchanging it for
      less than its worth. A plain proof, to my mind, that if you thought your
      society worth anything, you would ask for it not less than its equivalent
      in gold. (6) Hence the conclusion to which I have come, as already stated:
      good and upright you may be, since you do not cheat people from pure
      selfishness; but wise you cannot be, since your knowledge is not worth a
      cent.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (6) Or rather "money," lit. "silver."
</pre>
    <p>
      To this onslaught Socrates: Antiphon, it is a tenet which we cling to that
      beauty and wisdom have this in common, that there is a fair way and a foul
      way in which to dispose of them. The vendor of beauty purchases an evil
      name, but supposing the same person has discerned a soul of beauty in his
      lover and makes that man his friend, we regard his choice as sensible. (7)
      So is it with wisdom; he who sells it for money to the first bidder we
      name a sophist, (8) as though one should say a man who prostitutes his
      wisdom; but if the same man, discerning the noble nature of another, shall
      teach that other every good thing, and make him his friend, of such a one
      we say he does that which it is the duty of every good citizen of gentle
      soul to do. In accordance with this theory, I too, Antiphon, having my
      tastes, even as another finds pleasure in his horse and his hounds, (9)
      and another in his fighting cocks, so I too take my pleasure in good
      friends; and if I have any good thing myself I teach it them, or I commend
      them to others by whom I think they will be helped forwards on the path of
      virtue. The treasures also of the wise of old, written and bequeathed in
      their books, (10) I unfold and peruse in common with my friends. If our
      eye light upon any good thing we cull it eagerly, and regard it as great
      gain if we may but grow in friendship with one another.

      Again on some occasion the same Antiphon asked Socrates how he expected to
      make politicians of others when, even if he had the knowledge, he did not
      engage in politics himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Socrates replied: I will put to you a question, Antiphon: Which were the
      more statesmanlike proceeding, to practise politics myself single-handed,
      or to devote myself to making as many others as possible fit to engage in
      that pursuit?

      Let us here turn and consider whether by deterring his associates from
      quackery and false seeming he did not directly stimulate them to the
      pursuit of virtue. (1) He used often to say there was no better road to
      renown than the one by which a man became good at that wherein he desired
      to be reputed good. (2) The truth of the concept he enforced as follows:
      "Let us reflect on what a man would be driven to do who wanted to be
      thought a good flute player, without really being so. He would be forced
      to imitate the good flute player in the externals of his art, would he
      not? and first or all, seeing that these artists always have a splendid
      equipment, (3) and travel about with a long train of attendants, he must
      have the same; in the next place, they can command the plaudits of a
      multitude, he therefore must pack a conclave of clackers. But one thing is
      clear: nothing must induce him to give a performance, or he will be
      exposed at once, and find himself a laughing-stock not only as a sorry
      sort of flute player, but as a wretched imposter. And now he has a host of
      expenses to meet; and not one advantage to be reaped; and worse than all
      his evil reputation. What is left him but to lead a life stale and
      unprofitable, the scorn and mockery of men? Let us try another case.
      Suppose a man wished to be thought a good general or a good pilot, though
      he were really nothing of the sort, let us picture to our minds how it
      will fare with him. Of two misfortunes one: either with a strong desire to
      be thought proficient in these matters, he will fail to get others to
      agree with him, which will be bad enough; or he will succeed, with worse
      result; since it stands to reason that anyone appointed to work a vessel
      or lead an army without the requisite knowledge will speedily ruin a
      number of people whom he least desires to hurt, and will make but a sorry
      exit from the stage himself." Thus first by one instance and then another
      would he demonstrate the unprofitableness of trying to appear rich, or
      courageous, or strong, without really being the thing pretended. "You are
      sure sooner or later to have commands laid upon you beyond your power to
      execute, and failing just where you are credited with capacity, the world
      will give you no commiseration." "I call that man a cheat, and a great
      cheat too," he would say, "who gets money or goods out of some one by
      persuasion, and defrauds him; but of all imposters he surely is the
      biggest who can delude people into thinking that he is fit to lead the
      state, when all the while he is a worthless creature." (4)

      Now, if the effect of such discourses was, as I imagine, to deter his
      hearers from the paths of quackery and false-seeming, (1) so I am sure
      that language like the following was calculated to stimulate his followers
      to practise self-control and endurance: self-control in the matters of
      eating, drinking, sleeping, and the cravings of lust; endurance of cold
      and heat and toil and pain. He had noticed the undue licence which one of
      his acquaintances allowed himself in all such matters. (2) Accordingly he

      Tell me, Aristippus (Socrates said), supposing you had two children
      entrusted to you to educate, one of them must be brought up with an
      aptitude for government, and the other without the faintest propensity to
      rule—how would you educate them? What do you say? Shall we begin our
      inquiry from the beginning, as it were, with the bare elements of food and
      nutriment?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ar. Yes, food to begin with, by all means, being a first principle, (3)
      without which there is no man living but would perish.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (3) Aristippus plays upon the word {arkhe}.
</pre>
    <p>

      certain seasons will exhibit itself in both the children?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ar. It is to be expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Which, then, of the two must be trained, of his own free will, (4) to
      prosecute a pressing business rather than gratify the belly?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (4) {proairesis}.
</pre>
    <p>
      Ar. No doubt the one who is being trained to govern, if we would not have
      affairs of state neglected during (5) his government.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (5) Lit. "along of."
</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. And the same pupil must be furnished with a power of holding out
      against thirst also when the craving to quench it comes upon him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ar. Certainly he must.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And on which of the two shall we confer such self-control in regard
      to sleep as shall enable him to rest late and rise early, or keep vigil,
      if the need arise?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ar. To the same one of the two must be given that endurance also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well, and a continence in regard to matters sexual so great that
      nothing of the sort shall prevent him from doing his duty? Which of them
      claims that?

    <p>
      Ar. The same one of the pair again.

      the voluntary resolution to face toils rather than turn and flee from
      them?

      Ar. This, too, belongs of right to him who is being trained for
      government.

      Soc. Well, and to which of them will it better accord to be taught all
      knowledge necessary towards the mastery of antagonists?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ar. To our future ruler certainly, for without these parts of learning all
      his other capacities will be merely waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. (6)Will not a man so educated be less liable to be entrapped by rival
      powers, and so escape a common fate of living creatures, some of which (as
      we all know) are hooked through their own greediness, and often even in
      spite of a native shyness; but through appetite for food they are drawn
      towards the bait, and are caught; while others are similarly ensnared by
      drink?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (6)  (SS. 4, 5, L. Dind. ed Lips.)
</pre>
    <p>

      instance, or partridges, which, at the cry of the hen-bird, with lust and
      expectation of such joys grow wild, and lose their power of computing
      dangers: on they rush, and fall into the snare of the hunter?
    </p>
    <p>
      Aristippus assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And would it not seem to be a base thing for a man to be affected
      like the silliest bird or beast? as when the adulterer invades the
      innermost sanctum (7) of the house, though he is well aware of the risks
      which his crime involves, (8) the formidable penalties of the law, the
      danger of being caught in the toils, and then suffering the direst
      contumely. Considering all the hideous penalties which hang over the
      adulterer's head, considering also the many means at hand to release him
      from the thraldom of his passion, that a man should so drive headlong on
      to the quicksands of perdition (9)—what are we to say of such
      frenzy? The wretch who can so behave must surely be tormented by an evil
      spirit? (10)

      Ar. So it strikes me.

      Soc. And does it not strike you as a sign of strange indifference that,
      whereas the greater number of the indispensable affairs of men, as for
      instance, those of war and agriculture, and more than half the rest, need
      to be conducted under the broad canopy of heaven, (11) yet the majority of
      men are quite untrained to wrestle with cold and heat?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (11) Or, "in the open air."
</pre>
    <p>
      Aristippus again assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And do you not agree that he who is destined to rule must train
      himself to bear these things lightly?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ar. Most certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And whilst we rank those who are self-disciplined in all these
      matters among persons fit to rule, we are bound to place those incapable
      of such conduct in the category of persons without any pretension
      whatsoever to be rulers?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ar. I assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well, then, since you know the rank peculiar to either section of
      mankind, did it ever strike you to consider to which of the two you are
      best entitled to belong?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes I have (replied Aristippus). I do not dream for a moment of ranking
      myself in the class of those who wish to rule. In fact, considering how
      serious a business it is to cater for one's own private needs, I look upon
      it as the mark of a fool not to be content with that, but to further
      saddle oneself with the duty of providing the rest of the community with
      whatever they may be pleased to want. That, at the cost of much personal
      enjoyment, a man should put himself at the head of a state, and then, if
      he fail to carry through every jot and tittle of that state's desire, be
      held to criminal account, does seem to me the very extravagance of folly.
      Why, bless me! states claim to treat their rulers precisely as I treat my
      domestic slaves. I expect my attendants to furnish me with an abundance of
      necessaries, but not to lay a finger on one of them themselves. So these
      states regard it as the duty of a ruler to provide them with all the good
      things imaginable, but to keep his own hands off them all the while. (12)
      So then, for my part, if anybody desires to have a heap of pother himself,
      (13) and be a nuisance to the rest of the world, I will educate him in the
      manner suggested, and he shall take his place among those who are fit to
      rule; but for myself, I beg to be enrolled amongst those who wish to spend
      their days as easily and pleasantly as possible.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (12) Or, "but he must have no finger in the pie himself."

 (13) See Kuhner ad loc.

    <p>
      Soc. Shall we then at this point turn and inquire which of the two are
      likely to lead the pleasanter life, the rulers or the ruled?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ar. By all means let us do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. To begin then with the nations and races known to ourselves. (14) In
      Asia the Persians are the rulers, while the Syrians, Phrygians, Lydians
      are ruled; and in Europe we find the Scythians ruling, and the Maeotians
      being ruled. In Africa (15) the Carthaginians are rulers, the Libyans
      ruled. Which of these two sets respectively leads the happier life, in
      your opinion? Or, to come nearer home—you are yourself a Hellene—which
      among Hellenes enjoy the happier existence, think you, the dominant or the
      subject states?

</pre>
    <p>
      Nay, (16) I would have you to understand (exclaimed Aristippus) that I am
      just as far from placing myself in the ranks of slavery; there is, I take
      it, a middle path between the two which it is my ambition to tread,
      avoiding rule and slavery alike; it lies through freedom—the high
      road which leads to happiness.

<pre xml:space="preserve"> (16) Or, "Pardon me interrupting you, Socrates; but I have not the
    slightest intention of placing myself." See W. L. Newman, op. cit.

      Soc. True, if only your path could avoid human beings, as it avoids rule
      and slavery, there would be something in what you say. But being placed as
      you are amidst human beings, if you purpose neither to rule nor to be
      ruled, and do not mean to dance attendance, if you can help it, on those
      who rule, you must surely see that the stronger have an art to seat the
      weaker on the stool of repentance (17) both in public and in private, and
      to treat them as slaves. I daresay you have not failed to note this common
      case: a set of people has sown and planted, whereupon in comes another set
      and cuts their corn and fells their fruit-trees, and in every way lays
      siege to them because, though weaker, they refuse to pay them proper
      court, till at length they are persuaded to accept slavery rather than war
      against their betters. And in private life also, you will bear me out, the
      brave and powerful are known to reduce the helpless and cowardly to
      bondage, and to make no small profit out of their victims.

      Ar. Yes, but I must tell you I have a simple remedy against all such
      misadventures. I do not confine myself to any single civil community. I
      roam the wide world a foreigner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well, now, that is a masterly stroke, upon my word! (18) Of course,
      ever since the decease of Sinis, and Sciron, and Procrustes, (19) foreign
      travellers have had an easy time of it. But still, if I bethink me, even
      in these modern days the members of free communities do pass laws in their
      respective countries for self-protection against wrong-doing. Over and
      above their personal connections, they provide themselves with a host of
      friends; they gird their cities about with walls and battlements; they
      collect armaments to ward off evil-doers; and to make security doubly
      sure, they furnish themselves with allies from foreign states. In spite of
      all which defensive machinery these same free citizens do occasionally
      fall victims to injustice. But you, who are without any of these aids;
      you, who pass half your days on the high roads where iniquity is rife;
      (20) you, who, into whatever city you enter, are less than the least of
      its free members, and moreover are just the sort of person whom any one
      bent on mischief would single out for attack—yet you, with your
      foreigner's passport, are to be exempt from injury? So you flatter
      yourself. And why? Will the state authorities cause proclamation to be
      made on your behalf: "The person of this man Aristippus is secure; let his
      going out and his coming in be free from danger"? Is that the ground of
      your confidence? or do you rather rest secure in the consciousness that
      you would prove such a slave as no master would care to keep? For who
      would care to have in his house a fellow with so slight a disposition to
      work and so strong a propensity to extravagance? Suppose we stop and
      consider that very point: how do masters deal with that sort of domestic?
      If I am not mistaken, they chastise his wantonness by starvation; they
      balk his thieving tendencies by bars and bolts where there is anything to
      steal; they hinder him from running away by bonds and imprisonment; they
      drive the sluggishness out of him with the lash. Is it not so? Or how do
      you proceed when you discover the like tendency in one of your domestics?

      art, (21) which, if I mistake not, you hold to be happiness: how, may I
      ask, will he be better off than others who lie in evil case, in spite of
      themselves, simply because they suffer perforce, but in his case the
      hunger and the thirst, the cold shivers and the lying awake at nights,
      with all the changes he will ring on pain, are of his own choosing? For my
      part I cannot see what difference it makes, provided it is one and the
      same bare back which receives the stripes, whether the whipping be
      self-appointed or unasked for; nor indeed does it concern my body in
      general, provided it be my body, whether I am beleaguered by a whole
      armament of such evils (22) of my own will or against my will—except
      only for the folly which attaches to self-appointed suffering.

      Soc. What, Aristippus, does it not seem to you that, as regards such
      matters, there is all the difference between voluntary and involuntary
      suffering, in that he who starves of his own accord can eat when he
      chooses, and he who thirsts of his own free will can drink, and so for the
      rest; but he who suffers in these ways perforce cannot desist from the
      suffering when the humour takes him? Again, he who suffers hardship
      voluntarily, gaily confronts his troubles, being buoyed on hope (23)—just
      as a hunter in pursuit of wild beasts, through hope of capturing his
      quarry, finds toil a pleasure—and these are but prizes of little
      worth in return for their labours; but what shall we say of their reward
      who toil to obtain to themselves good friends, or to subdue their enemies,
      or that through strength of body and soul they may administer their
      households well, befriend their friends, and benefit the land which gave
      them birth? Must we not suppose that these too will take their sorrows
      lightly, looking to these high ends? Must we not suppose that they too
      will gaily confront existence, who have to support them not only their
      conscious virtue, but the praise and admiration of the world? (24) And
      once more, habits of indolence, along with the fleeting pleasures of the
      moment, are incapable, as gymnastic trainers say, of setting up (25) a
      good habit of body, or of implanting in the soul any knowledge worthy of
      account; whereas by painstaking endeavour in the pursuit of high and noble
      deeds, as good men tell us, through endurance we shall in the end attain
      the goal. So Hesiod somewhere says: (26)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">    Wickedness may a man take wholesale with ease, smooth is the way
    and her dwelling-place is very nigh; but in front of virtue the
    immortal gods have placed toil and sweat, long is the path and
    steep that leads to her, and rugged at the first, but when the
    summit of the pass is reached, then for all its roughness the path
    grows easy.

      "When Heracles was emerging from boyhood into the bloom of youth, having
      reached that season in which the young man, now standing upon the verge of
      independence, shows plainly whether he will enter upon the path of virtue
      or of vice, he went forth into a quiet place, and sat debating with
      himself which of those two paths he should pursue; and as he there sat
      musing, there appeared to him two women of great stature which drew nigh
      to him. The one was fair to look upon, frank and free by gift of nature,
      (30) her limbs adorned with purity and her eyes with bashfulness; sobriety
      set the rhythm of her gait, and she was clad in white apparel. The other
      was of a different type; the fleshy softness of her limbs betrayed her
      nurture, while the complexion of her skin was embellished that she might
      appear whiter and rosier than she really was, and her figure that she
      might seem taller than nature made her; she stared with wide-open eyes,
      and the raiment wherewith she was clad served but to reveal the ripeness
      of her bloom. With frequent glances she surveyed her person, or looked to
      see if others noticed her; while ever and anon she fixed her gaze upon the
      shadow of herself intently.

      advanced at an even pace (31) towards him, but the other, in her eagerness
      to outstrip her, ran forward to the youth, exclaiming, 'I see you,
      Heracles, in doubt and difficulty what path of life to choose; make me
      your friend, and I will lead you to the pleasantest road and easiest. This
      I promise you: you shall taste all of life's sweets and escape all
      bitters. In the first place, you shall not trouble your brain with war or
      business; other topics shall engage your mind; (32) your only speculation,
      what meat or drink you shall find agreeable to your palate; what delight
      (33) of ear or eye; what pleasure of smell or touch; what darling lover's
      intercourse shall most enrapture you; how you shall pillow your limbs in
      softest slumber; how cull each individual pleasure without alloy of pain;
      and if ever the suspicion steal upon you that the stream of joys will one
      day dwindle, trust me I will not lead you where you shall replenish the
      store by toil of body and trouble of soul. No! others shall labour, but

      to me, and in your nurture I have gauged your nature; wherefore I
      entertain good hope that if you choose the path which leads to me, you
      shall greatly bestir yourself to be the doer of many a doughty deed of
      noble emprise; and that I too shall be held in even higher honour for your
      sake, lit with the lustre shed by valorous deeds. (35) I will not cheat
      you with preludings of pleasure, (36) but I will relate to you the things
      that are according to the ordinances of God in very truth. Know then that
      among things that are lovely and of good report, not one have the gods
      bestowed upon mortal men apart from toil and pains. Would you obtain the
      favour of the gods, then must you pay these same gods service; would you
      be loved by your friends, you must benefit these friends; do you desire to
      be honoured by the state, you must give the state your aid; do you claim
      admiration for your virtue from all Hellas, you must strive to do some
      good to Hellas; do you wish earth to yield her fruits to you abundantly,
      to earth must you pay your court; do you seek to amass riches from your
      flocks and herds, on them must you bestow your labour; or is it your
      ambition to be potent as a warrior, able to save your friends and to
      subdue your foes, then must you learn the arts of war from those who have
      the knowledge, and practise their application in the field when learned;
      or would you e'en be powerful of limb and body, then must you habituate
      limbs and body to obey the mind, and exercise yourself with toil and
      sweat.'

      "Then spoke Virtue: 'Nay, wretched one, what good thing hast thou? or what
      sweet thing art thou acquainted with—that wilt stir neither hand nor
      foot to gain it? Thou, that mayest not even await the desire of pleasure,
      but, or ever that desire springs up, art already satiated; eating before
      thou hungerest, and drinking before thou thirsteth; who to eke out an
      appetite must invent an army of cooks and confectioners; and to whet thy
      thirst must lay down costliest wines, and run up and down in search of ice
      in summer-time; to help thy slumbers soft coverlets suffice not, but
      couches and feather-beds must be prepared thee and rockers to rock thee to
      rest; since desire for sleep in thy case springs not from toil but from
      vacuity and nothing in the world to do. Even the natural appetite of love
      thou forcest prematurely by every means thou mayest devise, confounding
      the sexes in thy service. Thus thou educatest thy friends: with insult in
      the night season and drowse of slumber during the precious hours of the
      day. Immortal, thou art cast forth from the company of gods, and by good
      men art dishonoured: that sweetest sound of all, the voice of praise, has
      never thrilled thine ears; and the fairest of all fair visions is hidden
      from thine eyes that have never beheld one bounteous deed wrought by thine
      own hand. If thou openest thy lips in speech, who will believe thy word?
      If thou hast need of aught, none shall satisfy thee. What sane man will
      venture to join thy rablle rout? Ill indeed are thy revellers to look
      upon, young men impotent of body, and old men witless in mind: in the
      heyday of life they batten in sleek idleness, and wearily do they drag
      through an age of wrinkled wretchedness: and why? they blush with shame at
      the thought of deeds done in the past, and groan for weariness at what is
      left to do. During their youth they ran riot through their sweet things,
      and laid up for themselves large store of bitterness against the time of
      eld. But my companionship is with the gods; and with the good among men my
      conversation; no bounteous deed, divine or human, is wrought without my
      aid. Therefore am I honoured in Heaven pre-eminently, and upon earth among
      men whose right it is to honour me; (38) as a beloved fellow-worker of all
      craftsmen; a faithful guardian of house and lands, whom the owners bless;
      a kindly helpmeet of servants; (39) a brave assistant in the labours of
      peace; an unflinching ally in the deeds of war; a sharer in all
      friendships indispensable. To my friends is given an enjoyment of meats
      and drinks, which is sweet in itself and devoid of trouble, in that they
      can endure until desire ripens, and sleep more delicious visits them than
      those who toil not. Yet they are not pained to part with it; nor for the
      sake of slumber do they let slip the performance of their duties. Among my
      followers the youth delights in the praises of his elders, and the old man
      glories in the honour of the young; with joy they call to memory their
      deeds of old, and in to-day's well-doing are well pleased. For my sake
      they are dear in the sight of God, beloved of their friends and honoured
      by the country of their birth. When the appointed goal is reached they lie
      not down in oblivion with dishonour, but bloom afresh—their praise
      resounded on the lips of men for ever. (40) Toils like these, O son of
      noble parents, Heracles, it is yours to meet with, and having endured, to
      enter into the heritage assured you of transcendant happiness.'"

      At another time, he had noticed the angry temper shown by Lamprocles, the
      elder of his sons, towards their mother, and thus addressed himself to the
      lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Pray, my son, did you ever hear of certain people being called
      ungrateful?
    </p>
    <p>
      That I have (replied the young man).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And have you understood what it is they do to get that bad name?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamp. Yes, I have: when any one has been kindly treated, and has it in his
      power to requite the kindness but neglects to do so, men call him
      ungrateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And you admit that people reckon the ungrateful among wrongdoers?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamp. I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And has it ever struck you to inquire whether, as regards the right
      or wrong of it, ingratitude may not perhaps resemble some such conduct as
      the enslavement, say, of prisoners, which is accounted wrong towards
      friends but justifiable towards enemies?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamp. Yes, I have put that question to myself. In my opinion, no matter
      who confers the kindness, friend or foe, the recipient should endeavour to
      requite it, failing which he is a wrongdoer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then if that is how the matter stands, ingratitude would be an
      instance of pure unadulterate wrongdoing?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamprocles assented to the proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. It follows, then, that in proportion to the greatness of the benefit
      conferred, the greater his misdoing who fails to requite the kindness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamprocles again assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Socrates continued: And where can we hope to find greater benefits than
      those which children derive from their parents—their father and
      mother who brought them out of nothingness into being, who granted them to
      look upon all these fair sights, and to partake of all those blessings
      which the gods bestow on man, things so priceless in our eyes that one and
      all we shudder at the thought of leaving them, and states have made death
      the penalty for the greatest crimes, because there is no greater evil
      through fear of which to stay iniquity.
    </p>
    <p>
      You do not suppose that human beings produce children for the sake of
      carnal pleasure (1) merely; were this the motive, street and bordell are
      full of means to quit them of that thrall; whereas nothing is plainer than
      the pains we take to seek out wives who shall bear us the finest children.
      (2) With these we wed, and carry on the race. The man has a twofold duty
      to perform: partly in cherishing her who is to raise up children along
      with him, and partly towards the children yet unborn in providing them
      with things that he thinks will contribute to their well-being—and
      of these as large a store as possible. The woman, conceiving, bears her
      precious burthen with travail and pain, and at the risk of life itself—sharing
      with that within her womb the food on which she herself is fed. And when
      with much labour she has borne to the end and brought forth her offspring,
      she feeds it and watches over it with tender care—not in return for
      any good thing previously received, for indeed the babe itself is little
      conscious of its benefactor and cannot even signify its wants; only she,
      the mother, making conjecture of what is good for it, and what will please
      it, essays to satisfy it; (3) and for many months she feeds it night and
      day, enduring the toil nor recking what return she shall receive for all
      her trouble. Nor does the care and kindness of parents end with nurture;
      but when the children seem of an age to learn, they teach them themselves
      whatever cunning they possess, as a guide to life, or where they feel that
      another is more competent, to him they send them to be taught at their
      expense. Thus they watch over their children, doing all in their power to
      enable them to grow up to be as good as possible.

      So be it (the youth answered); but even if she have done all that, and
      twenty times as much, no soul on earth could endure my mother's
      cross-grained temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Socrates: Which, think you, would be harder to bear—a wild
      beast's savagery or a mother's?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamp. To my mind, a mother's—at least if she be such as mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Dear me! And has this mother ever done you any injury—such as
      people frequently receive from beasts, by bite or kick?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamp. If she has not done quite that, she uses words which any one would
      sooner sell his life than listen to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And how many annoyances have you caused your mother, do you suppose,
      by fretfulness and peevishness in word and deed, night and day, since you
      were a little boy? How much sorrow and pain, when you were ill?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamp. Well, I never said or did anything to bring a blush to her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. No, come now! Do you suppose it is harder for you to listen to your
      mother's speeches than for actor to listen to actor on the tragic stage,
      (4) when the floodgates of abuse are opened?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (4) See Grote, "H. G." viii. 457; Plut. "Solon," xxix.
</pre>
    <p>
      Lamp. Yes; for the simple reason that they know it is all talk on their
      parts. The inquisitor may cross-question, but he will not inflict a fine;
      the threatener may hurl his menaces, but he will do no mischief—that
      is why they take it all so easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then ought you to fly into a passion, who know well enough that,
      whatever your mother says, she is so far from meaning you mischief that
      she is actually wishing blessings to descend upon you beyond all others?
      Or do you believe that your mother is really ill disposed towards you?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamp. No, I do not think that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then this mother, who is kindly disposed to you, and takes such
      tender care of you when you are ill to make you well again, and to see
      that you want for nothing which may help you; and, more than all, who is
      perpetually pleading for blessings in your behalf and offering her vows to
      Heaven (5)—can you say of her that she is cross-grained and harsh?
      For my part, I think, if you cannot away with such a mother, you cannot
      away with such blessings either.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (5) Or, "paying vows."

    <p>
      But tell me (he proceeded), do you owe service to any living being, think
      you? or are you prepared to stand alone? Prepared not to please or try to
      please a single soul? to follow none? To obey neither general nor ruler of
      any sort? Is that your attitude, or do you admit that you owe allegiance
      to somebody?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamp. Yes; certainly I owe allegiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. May I take it that you are willing to please at any rate your
      neighbour, so that he may kindle a fire for you in your need, may prove
      himself a ready helpmate in good fortune, or if you chance on evil and are
      stumbling, may friendlily stand by your side to aid?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamp. I am willing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well, and what of that other chance companion—your
      fellow-traveller by land or sea? what of any others, you may light upon?
      is it indifferent to you whether these be friends or not, or do you admit
      that the goodwill of these is worth securing by some pains on your part?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamp. I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. It stands thus then: you are prepared to pay attention to this, that,
      and the other stranger, but to your mother who loves you more than all
      else, you are bound to render no service, no allegiance? Do you not know
      that whilst the state does not concern itself with ordinary ingratitude or
      pass judicial sentence on it; whilst it overlooks the thanklessness of
      those who fail to make return for kindly treatment, it reserves its pains
      and penalties for the special case? If a man render not the service and
      allegiance due to his parents, on him the finger of the law is laid; his
      name is struck off the roll; he is forbidden to hold the archonship—which
      is as much as to say, "Sacrifices in behalf of the state offered by such a
      man would be no offerings, being tainted with impiety; nor could aught
      else be 'well and justly' performed of which he is the doer." Heaven help
      us! If a man fail to adorn the sepulchre of his dead parents the state
      takes cognisance of the matter, and inquisition is made in the scrutiny of
      the magistrates. (6) And as for you, my son, if you are in your sober
      senses, you will earnestly entreat your mother, lest the very gods take
      you to be an ungrateful being, and on their side also refuse to do you
      good; and you will beware of men also, lest they should perceive your
      neglect of your parents, and with one consent hold you in dishonour; (7)
      and so you find yourself in a desert devoid of friends. For if once the
      notion be entertained that here is a man ungrateful to his parents, no one
      will believe that any kindness shown you would be other than thrown away.

      At another time the differences between two brothers named Chaerephon and
      Chaerecrates, both well known to him, had drawn his attention; and on
      seeing the younger of the two he thus addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Tell me, Chaerecrates, you are not, I take it, one of those strange
      people who believe that goods are better and more precious than a brother;
      (1) and that too although the former are but senseless chattels which need
      protection, the latter a sensitive and sensible being who can afford it;
      and what is more, he is himself alone, whilst as for them their name is
      legion. And here again is a marvellous thing: that a man should count his
      brother a loss, because the goods of his brother are not his; but he does
      not count his fellow-citizens loss, and yet their possessions are not his;
      only it seems in their case he has wits to see that to dwell securely with
      many and have enough is better than to own the whole wealth of a community
      and to live in dangerous isolation; but this same doctrine as applied to
      brothers they ignore. Again, if a man have the means, he will purchase
      domestic slaves, because he wants assistants in his work; he will acquire
      friends, because he needs their support; but this brother of his—who
      cares about brothers? It seems a friend may be discovered in an ordinary
      citizen, but not in a blood relation who is also a brother. And yet it is
      a great vantage-ground towards friendship to have sprung from the same
      loins and to have been suckled at the same breasts, since even among
      beasts a certain natural craving, and sympathy springs up between
      creatures reared together. (2) Added to which, a man who has brothers
      commands more respect from the rest of the world than the man who has
      none, and who must fight his own battles. (3)

    discussion.

</pre>
    <p>
      Chaer. I daresay, Socrates, where the differences are not profound, reason
      would a man should bear with his brother, and not avoid him for some mere
      trifle's sake, for a brother of the right sort is, as you say, a blessing;
      but if he be the very antithesis of that, why should a man lay his hand to
      achieve the impossible?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well now, tell me, is there nobody whom Chaerephon can please any
      more than he can please yourself; or do some people find him agreeable
      enough?
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaer. Nay, there you hit it. That is just why I have a right to detest
      him. He can be pleasing enough to others, but to me, whenever he appears
      on the scene, he is not a blessing—no! but by every manner of means
      the reverse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. May it not happen that just as a horse is no gain to the inexpert
      rider who essays to handle him, so in like manner, if a man tries to deal
      with his brother after an ignorant fashion, this same brother will kick?
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaer. But is it likely now? How should I be ignorant of the art of
      dealing with my brother if I know the art of repaying kind words and good
      deeds in kind? But a man who tries all he can to annoy me by word and
      deed, I can neither bless nor benefit, and, what is more, I will not try.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well now, that is a marvellous statement, Chaerecrates. Your dog, the
      serviceable guardian of your flocks, who will fawn and lick the hand of
      your shepherd, when you come near him can only growl and show his teeth.
      Well; you take no notice of the dog's ill-temper, you try to propitiate
      him by kindness; but your brother? If your brother were what he ought to
      be, he would be a great blessing to you—that you admit; and, as you
      further confess, you know the secret of kind acts and words, yet you will
      not set yourself to apply means to make him your best of friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaer. I am afraid, Socrates, that I have no wisdom or cunning to make
      Chaerephon bear himself towards me as he should.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Yet there is no need to apply any recondite or novel machinery. Only
      bait your hook in the way best known to yourself, and you will capture
      him; whereupon he will become your devoted friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaer. If you are aware that I know some love-charm, Socrates, of which I
      am the happy but unconscious possessor, pray make haste and enlighten me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Answer me then. Suppose you wanted to get some acquaintance to invite
      you to dinner when he next keeps holy day, (4) what steps would you take?

    <p>
      Chaer. No doubt I should set him a good example by inviting him myself on
      a like occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And if you wanted to induce some friend to look after your affairs
      during your absence abroad, how would you achieve your purpose?
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaer. No doubt I should present a precedent in undertaking to look after
      his in like circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And if you wished to get some foreign friend to take you under his
      roof while visiting his country, what would you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaer. No doubt I should begin by offering him the shelter of my own roof
      when he came to Athens, in order to enlist his zeal in furthering the
      objects of my visit; it is plain I should first show my readiness to do as
      much for him in a like case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Why, it seems you are an adept after all in all the philtres known to
      man, only you chose to conceal your knowledge all the while; or is it that
      you shrink from taking the first step because of the scandal you will
      cause by kindly advances to your brother? And yet it is commonly held to
      redound to a man's praise to have outstripped an enemy in mischief or a
      friend in kindness. Now if it seemed to me that Chaerephon were better
      fitted to lead the way towards this friendship, (5) I should have tried to
      persuade him to take the first step in winning your affection, but now I
      am persuaded the first move belongs to you, and to you the final victory.

      Chaer. A startling announcement, Socrates, from your lips, and most unlike
      you, to bid me the younger take precedence of my elder brother. Why, it is
      contrary to the universal custom of mankind, who look to the elder to take
      the lead in everything, whether as a speaker or an actor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. How so? Is it not the custom everywhere for the younger to step aside
      when he meets his elder in the street and to give him place? Is he not
      expected to get up and offer him his seat, to pay him the honour of a soft
      couch, (6) to yield him precedence in argument?

      My good fellow, do not stand shilly-shallying, (7) but put out your hand
      caressingly, and you will see the worthy soul will respond at once with
      alacrity. Do you not note your brother's character, proud and frank and
      sensitive to honour? He is not a mean and sorry rascal to be caught by a
      bribe—no better way indeed for such riff-raff. No! gentle natures
      need a finer treatment. You can best hope to work on them by affection.

      Chaer. But suppose I do, and suppose that, for all my attempts, he shows
      no change for the better?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. At the worst you will have shown yourself to be a good, honest,
      brotherly man, and he will appear as a sorry creature on whom kindness is
      wasted. But nothing of the sort is going to happen, as I conjecture. My
      belief is that as soon as he hears your challenge, he will embrace the
      contest; pricked on by emulous pride, he will insist upon getting the
      better of you in kindness of word and deed.

    <p>
      At present you two are in the condition of two hands formed by God to help
      each other, but which have let go their business and have turned to
      hindering one another all they can. You are a pair of feet fashioned on
      the Divine plan to work together, but which have neglected this in order
      to trammel each other's gait. Now is it not insensate stupidity (8) to use
      for injury what was meant for advantage? And yet in fashioning two
      brothers God intends them, methinks, to be of more benefit to one another
      than either two hands, or two feet, or two eyes, or any other of those
      pairs which belong to man from his birth. (9) Consider how powerless these
      hands of ours if called upon to combine their action at two points more
      than a single fathom's length apart; (10) and these feet could not stretch
      asunder (11) even a bare fathom; and these eyes, for all the wide-reaching
      range we claim for them, are incapable of seeing simultaneously the back
      and front of an object at even closer quarters. But a pair of brothers,
      linked in bonds of amity, can work each for the other's good, though seas
      divide them. (12)

      I have at another time heard him discourse on the kindred theme of
      friendship in language well calculated, as it seemed to me, to help a man
      to choose and also to use his friends aright.
    </p>
    <p>
      He (Socrates) had often heard the remark made that of all possessions
      there is none equal to that of a good and sincere friend; but, in spite of
      this assertion, the mass of people, as far as he could see, concerned
      themselves about nothing so little as the acquisition of friends. Houses,
      and fields, and slaves, and cattle, and furniture of all sorts (he said)
      they were at pains to acquire, and they strove hard to keep what they had
      got; but to procure for themselves this greatest of all blessings, as they
      admitted a friend to be, or to keep the friends whom they already
      possessed, not one man in a hundred ever gave himself a thought. It was
      noticeable, in the case of a sickness befalling a man's friend and one of
      his own household simultaneously, the promptness with which the master
      would fetch the doctor to his domestic, and take every precaution
      necessary for his recovery, with much expenditure of pains; but meanwhile
      little account would be taken of the friend in like condition, and if both
      should die, he will show signs of deep annoyance at the death of his
      domestic, which, as he reflects, is a positive loss to him; but as regards
      his friend his position is in no wise materially affected, and thus,
      though he would never dream of leaving his other possessions disregarded
      and ill cared for, friendship's mute appeal is met with flat indifference.
      (1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (1) Or, "the cry of a friend for careful tending falls on deaf ears."
</pre>
    <p>
      Or to take (said he) a crowning instance: (2) with regard to ordinary
      possessions, however multifarious these may be, most people are at least
      acquainted with their number, but if you ask a man to enumerate his
      friends, who are not so very many after all perhaps, he cannot; or if, to
      oblige the inquirer, he essays to make a list, he will presently retract
      the names of some whom he had previously included. (3) Such is the amount
      of thought which people bestow upon their friends.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (2) Or, "Nor had he failed to observe another striking contrast." Cf.
    Cic. "Lael." 17; Diog. Laert. ii. 30.

 (3) i.e. "like a chess-player recalling a move."
</pre>
    <p>
      And yet what thing else may a man call his own is comparable to this one
      best possession! what rather will not serve by contrast to enhance the
      value of an honest friend! Think of a horse or a yoke of oxen; they have
      their worth; but who shall gauge the worth of a worthy friend? Kindlier
      and more constant than the faithfullest of slaves—this is that
      possession best named all-serviceable. (4) Consider what the post is that
      he assigns himself! to meet and supplement what is lacking to the welfare
      of his friends, to promote their private and their public interests, is
      his concern. Is there need of kindly action in any quarter? he will throw
      in the full weight of his support. Does some terror confound? he is at
      hand to help and defend by expenditure of money and of energy, (5) by
      appeals to reason or resort to force. His the privilege alike to gladden
      the prosperous in the hour of success and to sustain their footing who
      have well-nigh slipped. All that the hands of a man may minister, all that
      the eyes of each are swift to see, the ears to hear, and the feet to
      compass, he with his helpful arts will not fall short of. Nay, not seldom
      that which a man has failed to accomplish for himself, has missed seeing
      or hearing or attaining, a friend acting in behalf of friend will achieve
      vicariously. And yet, albeit to try and tend a tree for the sake of its
      fruit is not uncommon, this copious mine of wealth—this friend—attracts
      only a lazy and listless attention on the part of more than half the
      world.

      I remember listening to another argument of his, the effect of which would
      be to promote self-examination. The listener must needs be brought to ask
      himself, "Of what worth am I to my friends?" It happened thus. One of
      those who were with him was neglectful, as he noted, of a friend who was
      at the pinch of poverty (Antisthenes). (1) Accordingly, in the presence of
      the negligent person and of several others, he proceeded to question the
      sufferer.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (1) Antisthenes, "cynicorum et stoicorum parens." Cic. "de Or." iii.
    17; "ad Att." xii. 38. See below, III. iii. 17; "Symp." passim;

</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. What say you, Antisthenes?—have friends their values like
      domestic slaves? One of these latter may be worth perhaps two minae, (2)
      another only half a mina, a third five, and a fourth as much as ten; while
      they do say that Nicias, (3) the son of Niceratus, paid a whole talent for
      a superintendent of his silver mines. And so I propound the question to
      myself as follows: "Have friends, like slaves, their market values?"
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (2) A mina = L4 circ.

 (3) For Nicias see Thuc. vii. 77 foll.; "Revenues," iv. 14; Plut.
    "Nic." IV. v.; Lys. "de bon. Aristoph." 648.
</pre>
    <p>
      Not a doubt of it (replied Antisthenes). At any rate, I know that I would
      rather have such a one as my friend than be paid two minae, and there is
      such another whose worth I would not estimate at half a mina, and a third
      with whom I would not part for ten, and then again a fourth whose
      friendship would be cheap if it cost me all the wealth and pains in the
      world to purchase it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well then (continued Socrates), if that be so, would it not be well if
      every one were to examine himself: "What after all may I chance to be
      worth to my friends?" Should he not try to become as dear as possible, so
      that his friends will not care to give him up? How often do I hear the
      complaint: "My friend So-and-so has given me up"; or "Such an one, whom I
      looked upon as a friend, has sacrificed me for a mina." And every time I
      hear these remarks, the question arises in my mind: If the vendor of a
      worthless slave is ready to part with him to a purchaser for what he will
      fetch—is there not at least a strong temptation to part with a base
      friend when you have a chance of making something on the exchange? Good
      slaves, as far as I can see, are not so knocked down to the hammer; no,
      nor good friends so lightly parted with.

      Again, in reference to the test to be applied, if we would gauge the
      qualifications of a friend worth the winning, the following remarks of
      Socrates could not fail, I think, to prove instructive. (1)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (1) Or, "Again, as to establishing a test of character, since a friend
    worth having must be of a particular type, I cannot but think that
    the following remarks would prove instructive."
</pre>
    <p>
      Tell me (said Socrates, addressing Critobulus), supposing we stood in need
      of a good friend, how should we set about his discovery? We must, in the
      first place, I suppose, seek out one who is master of his appetites, not
      under the dominion, that is, of his belly, not addicted to the wine-cup or
      to lechery or sleep or idleness, since no one enslaved to such tyrants
      could hope to do his duty either by himself or by his friends, could he?
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly not (Critobulus answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Do you agree, then, that we must hold aloof from every one so
      dominated?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cri. Most assuredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well then (proceeded Socrates), what shall we say of the spendthrift who
      has lost his independence and is for ever begging of his neighbours; if he
      gets anything out of them he cannot repay, but if he fails to get
      anything, he hates you for not giving—do you not think that this man
      too would prove but a disagreeable friend?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cri. Certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then we must keep away from him too?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cri. That we must.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well! and what of the man whose strength lies in monetary
      transactions? (2) His one craving is to amass money; and for that reason
      he is an adept at driving a hard bargain (3)—glad enough to take in,
      but loath to pay out.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (2) Or, "the money-lender? He has a passion for big money-bags."

 (3) Or, "hard in all his dealings."
</pre>
    <p>
      Cri. In my opinion he will prove even a worse fellow than the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well! and what of that other whose passion for money-making is so
      absorbing that he has no leisure for anything else, save how he may add to
      his gains?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cri. Hold aloof from him, say I, since there is no good to be got out of
      him or his society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well! what of the quarrelsome and factious person (4) whose main
      object is to saddle his friends with a host of enemies?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (4) "The partisan."
</pre>
    <p>
      Cri. For God's sake let us avoid him also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. But now we will imagine a man exempt indeed from all the above
      defects—a man who has no objection to receive kindnesses, but it
      never enters into his head to do a kindness in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cri. There will be no good in him either. But, Socrates, what kind of man
      shall we endeavour to make our friend? what is he like?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. I should say he must be just the converse of the above: he has
      control over the pleasures of the body, he is kindly disposed, (5) upright
      in all his dealings, (6) very zealous is he not to be outdone in kindness
      by his benefactors, if only his friends may derive some profit from his
      acquaintance.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (5) Reading {eunous}, or if {euorkos}, transl. "a man of his word."

 (6) Or, "easy to deal with."
</pre>
    <p>
      Cri. But how are we to test these qualities, Socrates, before
      acquaintance?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. How do we test the merits of a sculptor?—not by inferences
      drawn from the talk of the artist merely. No, we look to what he has
      already achieved. These former statues of his were nobly executed, and we
      trust he will do equally well with the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cri. You mean that if we find a man whose kindness to older friends is
      established, we may take it as proved that he will treat his newer friends
      as amiably?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Why, certainly, if I see a man who has shown skill in the handling of
      horses previously, I argue that he will handle others no less skilfully
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cri. Good! and when we have discovered a man whose friendship is worth
      having, how ought we to make him our friend?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. First we ought to ascertain the will of Heaven whether it be
      advisable to make him our friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cri. Well! and how are we to effect the capture of this friend of our
      choice, whom the gods approve? will you tell me that?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not, in good sooth (replied Socrates), by running him down like a hare,
      nor by decoying him like a bird, or by force like a wild boar. (7) To
      capture a friend against his will is a toilsome business, and to bind him
      in fetters like a slave by no means easy. Those who are so treated are apt
      to become foes instead of friends. (8)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (7) Reading {kaproi}, al. {ekhthroi}, "an enemy."

 (8) Or, "Hate rather than friendship is the outcome of these methods."
</pre>
    <p>
      Cri. But how convert them into friends?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. There are certain incantations, we are told, which those who know
      them have only to utter, and they can make friends of whom they list; and
      there are certain philtres also which those who have the secret of them
      may administer to whom they like and win their love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cri. From what source shall we learn them?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. You need not go farther than Homer to learn that which the Sirens
      sang to Odysseus, (9) the first words of which run, I think, as follows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">    Hither, come hither, thou famous man, Odysseus, great glory of the
    Achaeans!

 (9) "Od." xii. 184.
</pre>
    <p>
      Cri. And did the magic words of this spell serve for all men alike? Had
      the Sirens only to utter this one incantation, and was every listener
      constrained to stay?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. No; this was the incantation reserved for souls athirst for fame, of
      virtue emulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cri. Which is as much as to say, we must suit the incantation to the
      listener, so that when he hears the words he shall not think that the
      enchanter is laughing at him in his sleeve. I cannot certainly conceive a
      method better calculated to excite hatred and repulsion than to go to some
      one who knows that he is small and ugly and a weakling, and to breathe in
      his ears the flattering tale that he is beautiful and tall and stalwart.
      But do you know any other love-charms, Socrates?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. I cannot say that I do; but I have heard that Pericles (10) was
      skilled in not a few, which he poured into the ear of our city and won her
      love.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (10) See above, I. ii. 40; "Symp." viii. 39.
</pre>
    <p>

    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (11) See below, III. vi. 2; IV. ii. 2.
</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. Ah, that was not by incantation at all. What he did was to encircle
      our city with an amulet of saving virtue. (12)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (12) See Herod. vii. 143, "the wooden wall"; Thuc. i. 93, "'the walls'
    of Athens."
</pre>
    <p>
      Cri. You would imply, Socrates, would you not, that if we want to win the
      love of any good man we need to be good ourselves in speech and action?
    </p>
    <p>
      And did you imagine (replied Socrates) that it was possible for a bad man
      to make good friends?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cri. Why, I could fancy I had seen some sorry speech-monger who was fast
      friends with a great and noble statesman; or again, some born commander
      and general who was boon companion with fellows quite incapable of
      generalship. (13)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (13) Or, "Why, yes, when I see some base orator fast friends with a
    great leader of the people; or, again, some fellow incapable of
    generalship a comrade to the greatest captains of his age."
</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. But in reference to the point we were discussing, may I ask whether
      you know of any one who can attach a useful friend to himself without
      being of use in return? (14) Can service ally in friendship with
      disservice?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (14) Add, "Can service ally in friendship with disservice? Must there
    not be a reciprocity of service to make friendship lasting?"
</pre>
    <p>
      Cri. In good sooth no. But now, granted it is impossible for a base man to
      be friends with the beautiful and noble, (14) I am concerned at once to
      discover if one who is himself of a beautiful and noble character can,
      with a wave of the hand, as it were, attach himself in friendship to every
      other beautiful and noble nature.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (14) {kalous kagathous}.
</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. What perplexes and confounds you, Critobulus, is the fact that so
      often men of noble conduct, with souls aloof from baseness, are not
      friends but rather at strife and discord with one another, and deal more
      harshly by one another than they would by the most good-for-nothing of
      mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cri. Yes, and this holds true not of private persons only, but states, the
      most eager to pursue a noble policy and to repudiate a base one, are
      frequently in hostile relation to one another. As I reason on these things
      my heart fails me, and the question, how friends are to be acquired, fills
      me with despondency. The bad, as I see, cannot be friends with one
      another. For how can such people, the ungrateful, or reckless, or
      covetous, or faithless, or incontinent, adhere together as friends?
      Without hesitation I set down the bad as born to be foes not friends, and
      as bearing the birthmark of internecine hate. But then again, as you
      suggest, no more can these same people harmonise in friendship with the
      good. For how should they who do evil be friends with those who hate all
      evil-doing? And if, last of all, they that cultivate virtue are torn by
      party strife in their struggle for the headship of the states, envying one
      another, hating one another, who are left to be friends? where shall
      goodwill and faithfulness be found among men?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. The fact is there is some subtlety in the texture of these things.
      (15) Seeds of love are implanted in man by nature. Men have need of one
      another, feel pity, help each other by united efforts, and in recognition
      of the fact show mutual gratitude. But there are seeds of war implanted
      also. The same objects being regarded as beautiful or agreeable by all
      alike, they do battle for their possession; a spirit of disunion (16)
      enters, and the parties range themselves in adverse camps. Discord and
      anger sound a note of war: the passion of more-having, staunchless
      avarice, threatens hostility; and envy is a hateful fiend. (17)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (15) i.e. a cunning intertwining of the threads of warp and woof.

 (16) Cf. Shelley, "The devil of disunion in their souls."

 (17) The diction is poetical.
</pre>
    <p>
      But nevertheless, through all opposing barriers friendship steals her way
      and binds together the beautiful and good among mankind. (18) Such is
      their virtue that they would rather possess scant means painlessly than
      wield an empire won by war. In spite of hunger and thirst they will share
      their meat and drink without a pang. Not bloom of lusty youth, nor love's
      delights can warp their self-control; nor will they be tempted to cause
      pain where pain should be unknown. It is theirs not merely to eschew all
      greed of riches, not merely to make a just and lawful distribution of
      wealth, but to supply what is lacking to the needs of one another. Theirs
      it is to compose strife and discord not in painless oblivion simply, but
      to the general advantage. Theirs also to hinder such extravagance of anger
      as shall entail remorse hereafter. And as to envy they will make a clean
      sweep and clearance of it: the good things which a man possesses shall be
      also the property of his friends, and the goods which they possess are to
      be looked upon as his. Where then is the improbability that the beautiful
      and noble should be sharers in the honours (19) of the state not only
      without injury, but even to their mutual advantage?

      They indeed who covet and desire the honours and offices in a state for
      the sake of the liberty thereby given them to embezzle the public moneys,
      to deal violently by their fellow-creatures, and to batten in luxury
      themselves, may well be regarded as unjust and villainous persons
      incapable of harmony with one another. But if a man desire to obtain these
      selfsame honours in order that, being himself secure against wrong-doing,
      he may be able to assist his friends in what is right, and, raised to a
      high position, (20) may essay to confer some blessing on the land of his
      fathers, what is there to hinder him from working in harmony with some
      other of a like spirit? Will he, with the "beautiful and noble" at his
      side, be less able to aid his friends? or will his power to benefit the
      community be shortened because the flower of that community are
      fellow-workers in that work? Why, even in the contests of the games it is
      obvious that if it were possible for the stoutest combatants to combine
      against the weakest, the chosen band would come off victors in every bout,
      and would carry off all the prizes. This indeed is against the rules of
      the actual arena; but in the field of politics, where the beautiful and
      good hold empery, and there is nought to hinder any from combining with
      whomsoever a man may choose to benefit the state, it will be a clear gain,
      will it not, for any one engaged in state affairs to make the best men his
      friends, whereby he will find partners and co-operators in his aims
      instead of rivals and antagonists? And this at least is obvious: in case
      of foreign war a man will need allies, but all the more if in the ranks
      opposed to him should stand the flower of the enemy. (21) Moreover, those
      who are willing to fight your battles must be kindly dealt with, that
      goodwill may quicken to enthusiasm; and one good man (22) is better worth
      your benefiting that a dozen knaves, since a little kindness goes a long
      way with the good, but with the base the more you give them the more they
      ask for.

<pre xml:space="preserve"> (20) "As archon," or "raised to rule."

    <p>
      So keep a good heart, Critobulus; only try to become good yourself, and
      when you have attained, set to your hand to capture the beautiful and
      good. Perhaps I may be able to give you some help in this quest, being
      myself an adept in Love's lore. (23) No matter who it is for whom my heart
      is aflame; in an instant my whole soul is eager to leap forth. With
      vehemence I speed to the mark. I, who love, demand to be loved again; this
      desire in me must be met by counter desire in him; this thirst for his
      society by thirst reciprocal for mine. And these will be your needs also,
      I foresee, whenever you are seized with longing to contract a friendship.
      Do not hide from me, therefore, whom you would choose as a friend, since,
      owing to the pains I take to please him who pleases me, I am not
      altogether unversed, I fancy, in the art of catching men. (24)

      Critobulus replied: Why, these are the very lessons of instruction,
      Socrates, for which I have been long athirst, and the more particularly if
      this same love's lore will enable me to capture those who are good of soul
      and those who are beautiful of person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Nay, now I warn you, Critobulus, it is not within the province of my
      science to make the beautiful endure him who would lay hands upon them.
      And that is why men fled from Scylla, I am persuaded, because she laid
      hands upon them; but the Sirens were different—they laid hands on
      nobody, but sat afar off and chanted their spells in the ears of all; and
      therefore, it is said, all men endured to listen, and were charmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cri. I promise I will not lay violent hands on any; therefore, if you have
      any good device for winning friends, instruct your pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And if there is to be no laying on of the hands, there must be no
      application either of the lips; is it agreed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cri. No, nor application of the lips to any one—not beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. See now! you cannot open your mouth without some luckless utterance.
      Beauty suffers no such liberty, however eagerly the ugly may invite it,
      making believe some quality of soul must rank them with the beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cri. Be of good cheer then; let the compact stand thus: "Kisses for the
      beautiful, and for the good a rain of kisses." So now teach us the art of
      catching friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well then, when you wish to win some one's affection, you will allow
      me to lodge information against you to the effect that you admire him and
      desire to be his friend?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cri. Lodge the indictment, with all my heart. I never heard of any one who
      hated his admirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And if I add to the indictment the further charge that through your
      admiration you are kindly disposed towards him, you will not feel I am
      taking away your character?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cri. Why, no; for myself I know a kindly feeling springs up in my heart
      towards any one whom I conceive to be kindly disposed to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. All this I shall feel empowered to say about you to those whose
      friendship you seek, and I can promise further help; only there is a
      comprehensive "if" to be considered: if you will further authorise me to
      say that you are devoted to your friends; that nothing gives you so much
      joy as a good friend; that you pride yourself no less on the fine deeds of
      those you love than on your own; and on their good things equally with
      your own; that you never weary of plotting and planning to procure them a
      rich harvest of the same; and lastly, that you have discovered a man's
      virtue is to excel his friends in kindness and his foes in hostility. If I
      am authorised thus to report of you, I think you will find me a
      serviceable fellow-hunter in the quest of friends, which is the conquest
      of the good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cri. Why this appeal to me?—as if you had not free permission to say
      exactly what you like about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. No; that I deny, on the authority of Aspasia. (25) I have it from her
      own lips. "Good matchmakers," she said tome, "were clever hands at
      cementing alliances between people, provided the good qualities they
      vouched for were truthfully reported; but when it came to their telling
      lies, for her part she could not compliment them. (26) Their poor deluded
      dupes ended by hating each other and the go-betweens as well." Now I
      myself am so fully persuaded of the truth of this that I feel it is not in
      my power to say aught in your praise which I cannot say with truth.

    <p>
      Cri. Really, Socrates, you are a wonderfully good friend to me—in so
      far as I have any merit which will entitle me to win a friend, you will
      lend me a helping hand, it seems; otherwise you would rather not forge any
      petty fiction for my benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. But tell me, how shall I assist you best, think you? By praising you
      falsely or by persuading you to try to be a good man? Or if it is not
      plain to you thus, look at the matter by the light of some examples. I
      wish to introduce you to a shipowner, or to make him your friend: I begin
      by singing your praises to him falsely thus, "You will find him a good
      pilot"; he catches at the phrase, and entrusts his ship to you, who have
      no notion of guiding a vessel. What can you expect but to make shipwreck
      of the craft and yourself together? or suppose by similar false assertions
      I can persuade the state at large to entrust her destinies to you—"a
      man with a fine genius for command," I say, "a practised lawyer," "a
      politician born," and so forth. The odds are, the state and you may come
      to grief through you. Or to take an instance from everyday life. By my
      falsehoods I persuade some private person to entrust his affairs to you as
      "a really careful and business-like person with a head for economy." When
      put to the test would not your administration prove ruinous, and the
      figure you cut ridiculous? No, my dear friend, there is but one road, the
      shortest, safest, best, and it is simply this: In whatsoever you desire to
      be deemed good, endeavour to be good. For of all the virtues namable among
      men, consider, and you will find there is not one but may be increased by
      learning and practice. For my part then, Critobulus, these are the
      principles on which we ought to go a-hunting; but if you take a different
      view, I am all attention, please instruct me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Critobulus: Nay, Socrates, I should be ashamed to gainsay what you
      have said; if I did, it would neither be a noble statement nor a true.

      He had two ways of dealing with the difficulties of his friends: where
      ignorance was the cause, he tried to meet the trouble by a dose of common
      sense; or where want and poverty were to blame, by lessoning them that
      they should assist one another according to their ability; and here I may
      mention certain incidents which occurred within my own knowledge. How, for
      instance, he chanced upon Aristarchus wearing the look of one who suffered
      from a fit of the "sullens," and thus accosted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. You seem to have some trouble on your mind, Aristarchus; if so, you
      should share it with your friends. Perhaps together we might lighten the
      weight of it a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aristarchus answered: Yes, Socrates, I am in sore straits indeed. Ever
      since the party strife declared itself in the city, (1) what with the rush
      of people to Piraeus, and the wholesale banishments, I have been fairly at
      the mercy of my poor deserted female relatives. Sisters, nieces, cousins,
      they have all come flocking to me for protection. I have fourteen
      free-born souls, I tell you, under my single roof, and how are we to live?
      We can get nothing out of the soil—that is in the hands of the
      enemy; nothing from my house property, for there is scarcely a living soul
      left in the city; my furniture? no one will buy it; money? there is none
      to be borrowed—you would have a better chance to find it by looking
      for it on the road than to borrow it from a banker. Yes, Socrates, to
      stand by and see one's relatives die of hunger is hard indeed, and yet to
      feed so many at such a pinch impossible.

      After he listened to the story, Socrates asked: How comes it that Ceramon,
      (2) with so many mouths to feed, not only contrives to furnish himself and
      them with the necessaries of life, but to realise a handsome surplus,
      whilst you being in like plight (3) are afraid you will one and all perish
      of starvation for want of the necessaries of life?

      should be in easy circumstances, while you and your far superior household
      are in difficulties?

      and I my liberally-educated household.

    <p>
      Ar. No less.

<pre xml:space="preserve"> (4) For these articles of dress see Becker's "Charicles," Exc. i. to

      maintains himself and his domestics, but many pigs and cattle besides, and
      realises such large profits that he frequently contributes to the state
      benevolences; (6) while there is Cyrebus, again, who, out of a bread
      factory, more than maintains the whole of his establishment, and lives in
      the lap of luxury; and Demeas of Collytus gets a livelihood out of a cloak

    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then, on the ground that they are free-born and your kinswomen, you
      think that they ought to do nothing but eat and sleep? Or is it your
      opinion that people who live in this way—I speak of free-born people
      in general—lead happier lives, and are more to be congratulated,
      than those who give their time and attention to such useful arts of life
      as they are skilled in? Is this what you see in the world, that for the
      purpose of learning what it is well to know, and of recollecting the
      lessons taught, or with a view to health and strength of body, or for the
      sake of acquiring and preserving all that gives life its charm, idleness
      and inattention are found to be helpful, whilst work and study are simply
      a dead loss? Pray, when those relatives of yours were taught what you tell
      me they know, did they learn it as barren information which they would
      never turn to practical account, or, on the contrary, as something with
      which they were to be seriously concerned some day, and from which they
      were to reap advantage? Do human beings in general attain to well-tempered
      manhood by a course of idling, or by carefully attending to what will be
      of use? Which will help a man the more to grow in justice and uprightness,
      to be up and doing, or to sit with folded hands revolving the ways and
      means of existence? As things now stand, if I am not mistaken, there is no
      love lost between you. You cannot help feeling that they are costly to
      you, and they must see that you find them a burthen? This is a perilous
      state of affairs, in which hatred and bitterness have every prospect of
      increasing, whilst the pre-existing bond of affection (8) is likely to be
      snapped.

      But now, if only you allow them free scope for their energies, when you
      come to see how useful they can be, you will grow quite fond of them, and
      they, when they perceive that they can please you, will cling to their
      benefactor warmly. Thus, with the memory of former kindnesses made
      sweeter, you will increase the grace which flows from kindnesses tenfold;
      you will in consequence be knit in closer bonds of love and domesticity.
      If, indeed, they were called upon to do any shameful work, let them choose
      death rather than that; but now they know, it would seem, the very arts

      suitable for women; and the things which we know, any of us, are just
      those which we can best perform, that is to say, with ease and expedition;
      it is a joy to do them, and the result is beautiful. (9) Do not hesitate,
      then, to initiate your friends in what will bring advantage to them and
      you alike; probably they will gladly respond to your summons.

      Well, upon my word (Aristarchus answered), I like so well what you say,
      Socrates, that though hitherto I have not been disposed to borrow, knowing
      that when I had spent what I got I should not be in a condition to repay,
      I think I can now bring myself to do so in order to raise a fund for these
      works.

      Thereupon a capital was provided; wools were purchased; the good man's
      relatives set to work, and even whilst they breakfasted they worked, and
      on and on till work was ended and they supped. Smiles took the place of
      frowns; they no longer looked askance with suspicion, but full into each
      other's eyes with happiness. They loved their kinsman for his kindness to
      them. He became attached to them as helpmates; and the end of it all was,
      he came to Socrates and told him with delight how matters fared; "and
      now," he added, "they tax me with being the only drone in the house, who
      sit and eat the bread of idleness."
    </p>
    <p>
      To which Socrates: Why do not you tell them the fable of the dog? (10)
      Once on a time, so goes the story, when beasts could speak, the sheep said
      to her master, "What a marvel is this, master, that to us, your own sheep,
      who provide you with fleeces and lambs and cheese, you give nothing, save
      only what we may nibble off earth's bosom; but with this dog of yours, who
      provides you with nothing of the sort, you share the very meat out of your
      mouth." When the dog heard these words, he answered promptly, "Ay, in good
      sooth, for is it not I who keep you safe and sound, you sheep, so that you
      are not stolen by man nor harried by wolves; since, if I did not keep
      watch over you, you would not be able so much as to graze afield, fearing
      to be destroyed." And so, says the tale, the sheep had to admit that the
      dog was rightly preferred to themselves in honour. And so do you tell your
      flock yonder that like the dog in the fable you are their guardian and
      overseer, and it is thanks to you that they are protected from evil and
      evildoers, so that they work their work and live their lives in blissful
      security.

      The other answered: From abroad, just before the close of the war; but at

      our possessions across the frontier, (2) and my father left me nothing in
      Attica, I must needs bide at home, and provide myself with the necessaries
      of life by means of bodily toil, which seems preferable to begging from
      another, especially as I have no security on which to raise a loan.

      estate? (3) By superintending his works, helping to get in his crops, and

      Soc. And yet, Eutherus, it would be hard to find a work which did not
      involve some liability to account; in fact it is difficult to do anything
      without some mistake or other, and no less difficult, if you should
      succeed in doing it immaculately, to escape all unfriendly criticism. I
      wonder now whether you find it easy to get through your present
      occupations entirely without reproach. No? Let me tell you what you should
      do. You should avoid censorious persons and attach yourself to the
      considerate and kind-hearted, and in all your affairs accept with a good
      grace what you can and decline what you feel you cannot do. Whatever it
      be, do it heart and soul, and make it your finest work. (4) There lies the
      method at once to silence fault-finders and to minister help to your own
      difficulties. Life will flow smoothly, risks will be diminished, provision
      against old age secured.

      At another time, as I am aware, he had heard a remark made by Crito (1)
      that life at Athens was no easy matter for a man who wished to mind his
      own affairs.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (1) Crito. See above, I. ii. 48; Cobet, "P. X."; cf. Plat. "Rep."
    viii. 549 C.
</pre>
    <p>
      As, for instance, at this moment (Crito proceeded) there are a set of
      fellows threatening me with lawsuits, not because they have any
      misdemeanour to allege against me, but simply under the conviction that I
      will sooner pay a sum of money than be troubled further.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which Socrates replied: Tell me, Crito, you keep dogs, do you not, to
      ward off wolves from your flocks?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cr. Certainly; it pays to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then why do you not keep a watchman willing and competent to ward off
      this pack of people who seek to injure you?
    </p>
    <p>
      I should not at all mind (he answered), if I were not afraid he might turn
      again and rend his keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      What! (rejoined Socrates), do you not see that to gratify a man like
      yourself is far pleasanter as a matter of self-interest than to quarrel
      with you? You may be sure there are plenty of people here who will take
      the greatest pride in making you their friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, they sought out Archedemus, (2) a practical man with a clever
      tongue in his head (3) but poor; the fact being, he was not the sort to
      make gain by hook or by crook, but a lover of honesty and of too good a
      nature himself to make his living as a pettifogger. (4) Crito would then
      take the opportunity of times of harvesting and put aside small presents
      for Achedemus of corn and oil, or wine, or wool, or any other of the farm
      produce forming the staple commodities of life, or he would invite him to
      a sacrificial feast, and otherwise pay him marked attention. Archedemus,
      feeling that he had in Crito's house a harbour of refuge, could not make
      too much of his patron, and ere long he had hunted up a long list of
      iniquities which could be lodged against Crito's pettifogging persecutors
      themselves, and not only their numerous crimes but their numerous enemies;
      and presently he prosecuted one of them in a public suit, where sentence
      would be given against him "what to suffer or what to pay." (5) The
      accused, conscious as he was of many rascally deeds, did all he could to
      be quit of Archedemus, but Archedemus was not to be got rid of. He held on
      until he had made the informer not only loose his hold of Crito but pay
      himself a sum of money; and now that Archedemus had achieved this and
      other similar victories, it is easy to guess what followed. (6) It was
      just as when some shepherd has got a very good dog, all the other
      shepherds wish to lodge their flocks in his neighbourhood that they too
      may reap the benefit of him. So a number of Crito's friends came begging
      him to allow Archedemus to be their guardian also, and Archedemus was
      overjoyed to do something to gratify Crito, and so it came about that not
      only Crito abode in peace, but his friends likewise. If any of those
      people with whom Archedemus was not on the best of terms were disposed to
      throw it in his teeth that he accepted his patron's benefits and paid in
      flatteries, he had a ready retort: "Answer me this question—which is
      the more scandalous, to accept kindnesses from honest folk and to repay
      them, with the result that I make such people my friends but quarrel with
      knaves, or to make enemies of honourable gentlemen (7) by attempts to do
      them wrong, with the off-chance indeed of winning the friendship of some
      scamps in return for my co-operation, but the certainty of losing in the
      tone of my acquaintances?" (8)

      Again I may cite, as known to myself, (1) the following discussion; the
      arguments were addressed to Diodorus, one of his companions. The master
      said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (1) Or, "for which I can personally vouch."
</pre>
    <p>
      Tell me, Diodorus, if one of your slaves runs away, are you at pains to
      recover him?
    </p>
    <p>
      More than that (Diodorus answered), I summon others to my aid and I have a
      reward cried for his recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well, if one of your domestics is sick, do you tend him and call in
      the doctors to save his life?
    </p>
    <p>
      Diod. Decidedly I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And if an intimate acquaintance who is far more precious to you than
      any of your household slaves is about to perish of want, you would think
      it incumbent on you to take pains to save his life? Well! now you know
      without my telling you that Hermogenes (2) is not made of wood or stone.
      If you helped him he would be ashamed not to pay you in kind. And yet—the
      opportunity of possessing a willing, kindly, and trusty assistant well
      fitted to do your bidding, and not merely that, but capable of originating
      useful ideas himself, with a certain forecast of mind and judgment—I
      say such a man is worth dozens of slaves. Good economists tell us that
      when a precious article may be got at a low price we ought to buy. And
      nowadays when times are so bad it is possible to get good friends
      exceedingly cheap.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (2) Hermogenes, presumably the son of Hipponicus. See I. ii. 48.

    <p>
      Diodorus answered: You are quite right, Socrates; bid Hermogenes come to
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Bid Hermogenes come to you!—not I indeed! since for aught I can
      understand you are no better entitled to summon him that to go to him
      yourself, nor is the advantage more on his side than your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Diodorus went off in a trice to seek Hermogenes, and at no great
      outlay won to himself a friend—a friend whose one concern it now was
      to discover how, by word or deed, he might help and gladden Diodorus.

      Aspirants to honour and distinction (1) derived similar help from
      Socrates, who in each case stimulated in them a persevering assiduity
      towards their several aims, as the following narratives tend to show. He
      had heard on one occasion of the arrival in Athens of Dionysodorus, (2)
      who professed to teach the whole duty of a general. (3) Accordingly he
      remarked to one of those who were with him—a young man whose anxiety
      to obtain the office of Strategos (4) was no secret to him:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (1) {ton kalon} = everything which the {kalos te kagathos} should aim
    at, but especially the honourable offices of state such as the
    Archonship, Strategia, Hipparchia, etc. See Plat. "Laches."

 (2) Dionysodorus of Chios, presumably. See Plat. "Euthyd." 271 C foll.

 (3) A professor of the science and art of strategy.

 (4) Lit. "that honour," sc. the Strategia.
</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. It would be monstrous on the part of any one who sought to become a
      general (5) to throw away the slightest opportunity of learning the duties
      of the office. Such a person, I should say, would deserve to be fined and
      punished by the state far more than the charlatan who without having
      learnt the art of a sculptor undertakes a contract to carve a statue.
      Considering that the whole fortunes of the state are entrusted to the
      general during a war, with all its incidental peril, it is only reasonable
      to anticipate that great blessings or great misfortunes will result in
      proportion to the success or bungling of that officer. I appeal to you,
      young sir, do you not agree that a candidate who, while taking pains to be
      elected neglects to learn the duties of the office, would richly deserve
      to be fined?

      With arguments like these he persuaded the young man to go and take
      lessons. After he had gone through the course he came back, and Socrates
      proceeded playfully to banter him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Behold our young friend, sirs, as Homer says of Agamemnon, of mein
      majestical, (6) so he; does he not seem to move more majestically, like
      one who has studied to be a general? Of course, just as a man who has
      learned to play the harp is a harper, even if he never touch the
      instrument, or as one who has studied medicine is a physician, though he
      does not practise, so our friend here from this time forward is now and
      ever shall be a general, even though he does not receive a vote at the
      elections. But the dunce who has not the science is neither general nor
      doctor, no, not even if the whole world appointed him. But (he proceeded,
      turning to the youth), in case any of us should ever find ourselves
      captain or colonel (7) under you, to give us some smattering of the
      science of war, what did the professor take as the starting-point of his
      instruction in generalship? Please inform us.

    <p>
      Yet surely (replied Socrates) that is only an infinitesimal part of
      generalship. A general (9) must be ready in furnishing the material of
      war: in providing the commissariat for his troops; quick in devices, he
      must be full of practical resource; nothing must escape his eye or tax his
      endurance; he must be shrewd, and ready of wit, a combination at once of
      clemency and fierceness, of simplicity and of insidious craft; he must
      play the part of watchman, of robber; now prodigal as a spendthrift, and
      again close-fisted as a miser, the bounty of his munificence must be
      equalled by the narrowness of his greed; impregnable in defence, a very
      dare-devil in attack—these and many other qualities must he possess
      who is to make a good general and minister of war; they must come to him
      by gift of nature or through science. No doubt it is a grand thing also to
      be a tactician, since there is all the difference in the world between an
      army properly handled in the field and the same in disorder; just as
      stones and bricks, woodwork and tiles, tumbled together in a heap are of
      no use at all, but arrange them in a certain order—at bottom and
      atop materials which will not crumble or rot, such as stones and earthen
      tiles, and in the middle between the two put bricks and woodwork, with an
      eye to architectural principle, (10) and finally you get a valuable
      possession—to wit, a dwelling-place.

      The simile is very apt, Socrates (11) (replied the youth), for in battle,

      and bad; but if not, where is the use of your learning? It would scarcely
      help you, would it, to be told to arrange coins in piles, the best coins

      us is to carry off some bullion; it will be a right disposition of our
      forces if we place in the vanguard those who are the greediest of gain?

      praise and glory. (13) Fortunately such people are not hid away in a

    </p>

      He did not, did not he? (he answered). Bless me! Go back to him again,
      then, and ply him with questions; if he really has the science, and is not

      At another time he fell in with a man who had been chosen general and
      minister of war, and thus accosted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Why did Homer, think you, designate Agamemnon "shepherd of the
      peoples"? (1) Was it possibly to show that, even as a shepherd must care
      for his sheep and see that they are safe and have all things needful, and
      that the objects of their rearing be secured, so also must a general take
      care that his soldiers are safe and have their supplies, and attain the
      objects of their soldiering? Which last is that they may get the mastery
      of their enemies, and so add to their own good fortune and happiness; or
      tell me, what made him praise Agamemnon, saying—
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">    He is both a good king and a warrior bold? (2)
</pre>
    <p>
      Did he mean, perhaps, to imply that he would be a 'warrior bold,' not
      merely in standing alone and bravely battling against the foe, but as
      inspiring the whole of his host with like prowess; and by a 'good king,'
      not merely one who should stand forth gallantly to protect his own life,
      but who should be the source of happiness to all over whom he reigns?
      Since a man is not chosen king in order to take heed to himself, albeit
      nobly, but that those who chose him may attain to happiness through him.
      And why do men go soldiering except to ameliorate existence? (3) and to
      this end they choose their generals that they may find in them guides to
      the goal in question. He, then, who undertakes that office is bound to
      procure for those who choose him the thing they seek for. And indeed it
      were not easy to find any nobler ambition than this, or aught ignobler
      than its opposite.

      your object. The command to which you are appointed concerns horses and

    <p>

      the horses.
    </p>
    <p>

      trooper is personally responsible for the condition of his horse.

    <p>
      Soc. But suppose, when they present themselves and their horses, (5) you
      find that some have brought beasts with bad feet or legs or otherwise
      infirm, and others such ill-fed jades that they cannot keep up on the
      march; others, again, brutes so ill broken and unmanageable that they will
      not keep their place in the ranks, and others such desperate plungers that
      they cannot be got to any place in the ranks at all. What becomes of your
      cavalry force then? How will you charge at the head of such a troop, and
      win glory for the state?

      have a better chance of saving himself.

      then? Give orders to draw the enemy down to the sandy ground (6) where you

      Hipp. That would be better, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well, shall you regard it as a part of your duty to see that as many
      of your men as possible can take aim and shoot on horseback? (7)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (7) Cf. "Hipparch," i. 21.

    <p>
      Hipp. It will be better, certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And have you thought how to whet the courage of your troopers? to
      kindle in them rage to meet the enemy?—which things are but
      stimulants to make stout hearts stouter?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hipp. If I have not done so hitherto, I will try to make up for lost time
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And have you troubled your head at all to consider how you are to
      secure the obedience of your men? for without that not one particle of
      good will you get, for all your horses and troopers so brave and so stout.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hipp. That is a true saying; but how, Socrates, should a man best bring
      them to this virtue? (8)

<pre xml:space="preserve"> (8) {protrepsasthai}. See above, I. ii. 64; below, IV. v. 1.

    <p>
      Soc. I presume you know that in any business whatever, people are more apt
      to follow the lead of those whom they look upon as adepts; thus in case of
      sickness they are readiest to obey him whom they regard as the cleverest
      physician; and so on a voyage the most skilful pilot; in matters
      agricultural the best farmer, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hipp. Yes, certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then in this matter of cavalry also we may reasonably suppose that he
      who is looked upon as knowing his business best will command the readiest
      obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hipp. If, then, I can prove to my troopers that I am better than all of
      them, will that suffice to win their obedience?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Yes, if along with that you can teach them that obedience to you
      brings greater glory and surer safety to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hipp. How am I to teach them that?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Upon my word! How are you to teach them that? Far more easily, I take
      it, than if you had to teach them that bad things are better than good,
      and more advantageous to boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hipp. I suppose you mean that, besides his other qualifications a
      commandant of cavalry must have command of speech and argument? (9)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (9) Or, "practise the art of oratory"; "express himself clearly and

</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. Were you under the impression that the commandant was not to open his
      mouth? Did it never occur to you that all the noblest things which custom
      (10) compels us to learn, and to which indeed we owe our knowledge of
      life, have all been learned by means of speech (11) and reason; and if
      there be any other noble learning which a man may learn, it is this same
      reason whereby he learns it; and the best teachers are those who have the
      freest command of thought and language, and those that have the best
      knowledge of the most serious things are the most brilliant masters of
      disputation. Again, have you not observed that whenever this city of ours
      fits out one of her choruses—such as that, for instance, which is
      sent to Delos (12)—there is nothing elsewhere from any quarter of
      the world which can compete with it; nor will you find in any other state
      collected so fair a flower of manhood as in Athens? (13)

      differ from the rest of the world so much, nor in stature of body or
      strength of limb, but in ambition and that love of honour (14) which most
      of all gives a keen edge to the spirit in the pursuit of things lovely and

      also, here in Athens, we should far outstrip the rest of the world,
      whether in the furnishing of arms and horses, or in orderliness of
      battle-array, or in eager hazardous encounter with the foe, if only we
      could persuade ourselves that by so doing we should obtain honour and
      distinction?

      At another time, seeing Nicomachides on his way back from the elections
      (of magistrates), (1) he asked him: Who are elected generals,
      Nicomachides?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (1) Cf. "Pol. Ath." i. 3; Aristot. "Ath. Pol." 44. 4; and Dr. Sandys'
    note ad loc. p. 165 of his edition.
</pre>
    <p>
      And he: Is it not just like them, these citizens of Athens—just like
      them, I say—to go and elect, not me, who ever since my name first
      appeared on the muster-roll have literally worn myself out with military
      service—now as a captain, now as a colonel—and have received
      all these wounds from the enemy, look you! (at the same time, and suiting
      the action to the word, he bared his arms and proceeded to show the scars
      of ancient wounds)—they elect not me (he went on), but, if you
      please, Antisthenes! who never served as a hoplite (2) in his life nor in
      the cavalry ever made a brilliant stroke, that I ever heard tell of; no!
      in fact, he has got no science at all, I take it, except to amass stores
      of wealth.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (2) Cf. Lys. xiv. 10.
</pre>
    <p>
      But still (returned Socrates), surely that is one point in his favour—he
      ought to be able to provide the troops with supplies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nic. Well, for the matter of that, merchants are good hands at collecting
      stores; but it does not follow that a merchant or trader will be able to
      command an army.
    </p>
    <p>
      But (rejoined Socrates) Antisthenes is a man of great pertinacity, who
      insists on winning, and that is a very necessary quality in a general. (3)
      Do not you see how each time he has been choragos (4) he has been
      successful with one chorus after another?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (3) See Grote, "Plato," i. 465 foll.

 (4) Choir-master, or Director of the Chorus. It was his duty to
    provide and preside over a chorus to sing, dance, or play at any
    of the public festivals, defraying the cost as a state service of
    {leitourgia}. See "Pol. Ath." iii. 4; "Hiero," ix. 4; Aristot.
    "Pol. Ath." 28. 3.
</pre>
    <p>
      Nic. Bless me! yes; but there is a wide difference between standing at the
      head of a band of singers and dancers and a troop of soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Still, without any practical skill in singing or in the training of a
      chorus, Antisthenes somehow had the art to select the greatest proficients
      in both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nic. Yes, and by the same reasoning we are to infer that on a campaign he
      will find proficients, some to marshal the troops for him and others to
      fight his battles?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Just so. If in matters military he only exhibits the same skill in
      selecting the best hands as he has shown in matters of the chorus, it is
      highly probable he will here also bear away the palm of victory; and we
      may presume that if he expended so much to win a choric victory with a
      single tribe, (5) he will be ready to expend more to secure a victory in
      war with the whole state to back him.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (5) See Dem. "against Lept." 496. 26. Each tribe nominated such of its
    members as were qualified to undertake the burden.
</pre>
    <p>
      Nic. Do you really mean, Socrates, that it is the function of the same man
      to provide efficient choruses and to act as commander-in-chief?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. I mean this, that, given a man knows what he needs to provide, and
      has the skill to do so, no matter what the department of things may be—house
      or city or army—you will find him a good chief and director (6) of
      the same.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (6) Or, "representative."
</pre>
    <p>
      Then Nicomachides: Upon my word, Socrates, I should never have expected to
      hear you say that a good housekeeper (7) and steward of an estate would
      make a good general.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (7) Or, "economist"; cf. "Cyrop." I. vi. 12.

</pre>
    <p>

      obedience of those under them to their orders?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nic. Certainly.
    </p>

      Soc. And also to assign to those best qualified to perform them their
      distinctive tasks?
    </p>
    <p>
      That, too, belongs to both alike (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Again, to chastise the bad and reward the good belongs to both alike,
      methinks?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nic. Decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And to win the kindly feeling of their subordinates must surely be
      the noble ambition of both?
    </p>
    <p>
      That too (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And do you consider it to the interest of both alike to win the
      adherence of supporters and allies? (9)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (9) In reference to the necessity of building up a family connection
    or political alliances cf. Arist. "Pol." iii. 9, 13.

    <p>
      Nic. Without a doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And does it not closely concern them both to be good guardians of
      their respective charges?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nic. Very much so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then it equally concerns them both to be painstaking and prodigal of
      toil in all their doings?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nic. Yes, all these duties belong to both alike, but the parallel ends
      when you come to actual fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Yet they are both sure to meet with enemies?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nic. There is no doubt about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then is it not to the interest of both to get the upper hand of
      these?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nic. Certainly; but you omit to tell us what service organisation and the
      art of management will render when it comes to actual fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Why, it is just then, I presume, it will be of most service, for the
      good economist knows that nothing is so advantageous or so lucrative as
      victory in battle, or to put it negatively, nothing so disastrous and
      expensive as defeat. He will enthusiastically seek out and provide
      everything conducive to victory, he will painstakingly discover and guard
      against all that tends to defeat, and when satisfied that all is ready and
      ripe for victory he will deliver battle energetically, and what is equally
      important, until the hour of final preparation has arrived, (10) he will
      be cautious to deliver battle. Do not despise men of economic genius,
      Nicomachides; the difference between the devotion requisite to private
      affairs and to affairs of state is merely one of quantity. For the rest
      the parallel holds strictly, and in this respect pre-eminently, that both
      are concerned with human instruments: which human beings, moreover, are of
      one type and temperament, whether we speak of devotion to public affairs
      or of the administration of private property. To fare well in either case
      is given to those who know the secret of dealing with humanity, whereas
      the absence of that knowledge will as certainly imply in either case a
      fatal note of discord. (11)

      Shall we (Socrates continued), shall we balance the arguments for and

      ever since the disaster of the thousand under Tolmides at Lebadeia,
      coupled with that under Hippocrates at Delium, (6) the prestige of Athens
      by comparison with the Boeotians has been lowered, whilst the spirit of
      Thebes as against Athens had been correspondingly exalted, so that those
      Boeotians who in old days did not venture to give battle to the Athenians
      even in their own territory unless they had the Lacedaemonians and the
      rest of the Peloponnesians to help them, do nowadays threaten to make an
      incursion into Attica single-handed; and the Athenians, who formerly, if
      they had to deal with the Boeotians (7) only, made havoc of their
      territory, are now afraid the Boeotians may some day harry Attica.

      To which Socrates: Yes, I perceive that this is so, but it seems to me
      that the state was never more tractably disposed, never so ripe for a
      really good leader, as to-day. For if boldness be the parent of
      carelessness, laxity, and insubordination, it is the part of fear to make
      people more disposed to application, obedience, and good order. A proof of
      which you may discover in the behaviour of people on ship-board. It is in
      seasons of calm weather when there is nothing to fear that disorder may be
      said to reign, but as soon as there is apprehension of a storm, or an
      enemy in sight, the scene changes; not only is each word of command
      obeyed, but there is a hush of silent expectation; the mariners wait to
      catch the next signal like an orchestra with eyes upon the leader.

      the flood, it is high time also to explain by what means we are to

      Well (proceeded Socrates), supposing we wished them to lay claim to
      certain material wealth now held by others, we could not better stimulate
      them to lay hands on the objects coveted than by showing them that these
      were ancestral possessions (9) to which they had a natural right. But
      since our object is that they should set their hearts on virtuous
      pre-eminence, we must prove to them that such headship combined with
      virtue is an old time-honoured heritage which pertains to them beyond all
      others, and that if they strive earnestly after it they will soon out-top
      the world.

      series of battles fought in the days of Theseus (15)—in all which
      the virtuous pre-eminence of our ancestry above the men of their own times
      was made manifest. Or, if you please, we may come down to things of a
      later date, which their descendants and the heroes of days not so long
      anterior to our own wrought in the struggle with the lords of Asia, (16)
      nay of Europe also, as far as Macedonia: a people possessing a power and
      means of attack far exceeding any who had gone before—who, moreover,
      had accomplished the doughtiest deeds. These things the men of Athens

      Then Pericles: And the wonder to me, Socrates, is how our city ever came
      to decline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. I think we are victims of our own success. Like some athlete, (19)
      whose facile preponderance in the arena has betrayed him into laxity until
      he eventually succumbs to punier antagonists, so we Athenians, in the
      plenitude of our superiority, have neglected ourselves and are become
      degenerate.

      Per. What then ought we to do now to recover our former virtue?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. There need be no mystery about that, I think. We can rediscover the
      institutions of our forefathers—applying them to the regulation of
      our lives with something of their precision, and not improbably with like
      success; or we can imitate those who stand at the front of affairs to-day,
      (20) adapting to ourselves their rule of life, in which case, if we live
      up to the standard of our models, we may hope at least to rival their
      excellence, or, by a more conscientious adherence to what they aim at,
      rise superior.

      You would seem to suggest (he answered) that the spirit of beautiful and
      brave manhood has taken wings and left our city; (21) as, for instance,
      when will Athenians, like the Lacedaemonians, reverence old age—the
      Athenian, who takes his own father as a starting-point for the contempt he
      pours upon grey hairs? When will he pay as strict an attention to the
      body, who is not content with neglecting a good habit, (22) but laughs to
      scorn those who are careful in this matter? When shall we Athenians so
      obey our magistrates—we who take a pride, as it were, in despising
      authority? When, once more, shall we be united as a people—we who,
      instead of combining to promote common interests, delight in blackening
      each other's characters, (23) envying one another more than we envy all
      the world besides; and—which is our worst failing—who, in
      private and public intercourse alike, are torn by dissension and are
      caught in a maze of litigation, and prefer to make capital out of our
      neighbour's difficulties rather than to render natural assistance? To make
      our conduct consistent, indeed, we treat our national interests no better
      than if they were the concerns of some foreign state; we make them bones
      of contention to wrangle over, and rejoice in nothing so much as in
      possessing means and ability to indulge these tastes. From this hotbed is
      engendered in the state a spirit of blind folly (24) and cowardice, and in
      the hearts of the citizens spreads a tangle of hatred and mutual hostility
      which, as I often shudder to think, will some day cause some disaster to
      befall the state greater than it can bear. (25)

    <p>
      Do not (replied Socrates), do not, I pray you, permit yourself to believe
      that Athenians are smitten with so incurable a depravity. Do you not
      observe their discipline in all naval matters? Look at their prompt and
      orderly obedience to the superintendents at the gymnastic contests, (26)
      their quite unrivalled subservience to their teachers in the training of
      our choruses.

      Yes (he answered), there's the wonder of it; to think that all those good
      people should so obey their leaders, but that our hoplites and our
      cavalry, who may be supposed to rank before the rest of the citizens in
      excellence of manhood, (27) should be so entirely unamenable to
      discipline.

      Soc. Then can you name any similar body, judicial or executive, trying
      cases or transacting other business with greater honour, stricter
      legality, higher dignity, or more impartial justice?
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I have no fault to find on that score (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then we ought not to despair as though all sense of orderliness and
      good discipline had died out of our countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still (he answered), if it is not to harp upon one string, I maintain that
      in military service, where, if anywhere, sobreity and temperance,
      orderliness and good discipline are needed, none of these essentials
      receives any attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      May it not perhaps be (asked Socrates) that in this department they are
      officered by those who have the least knowledge? (29) Do you not notice,
      to take the case of harp-players, choric performers, dancers, and the
      like, that no one would ever dream of leading if he lacked the requisite
      knowledge? and the same holds of wrestlers or pancratiasts.

      Moreover, while in these cases any one in command can tell you where he
      got the elementary knowledge of what he presides over, most generals are
      amateurs and improvisers. (30) I do not at all suppose that you are one of
      that sort. I believe you could give as clear an account of your schooling
      in strategy as you could in the matter of wrestling. No doubt you have got
      at first hand many of your father's "rules for generalship," which you
      carefully preserve, besides having collected many others from every
      quarter whence it was possible to pick up any knowledge which would be of
      use to a future general. Again, I feel sure you are deeply concerned to
      escape even unconscious ignorance of anything which will be serviceable to
      you in so high an office; and if you detect in yourself any ignorance, you
      turn to those who have knowledge in these matters (sparing neither gifts
      nor gratitude) to supplement your ignorance by their knowledge and to
      secure their help.

      To which Pericles: I am not so blind, Socrates, as to imagine you say
      these words under the idea that I am truly so careful in these matters;
      but rather your object is to teach me that the would-be general must make
      such things his care. I admit in any case all you say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Socrates proceeded: Has it ever caught your observation, Pericles, that a
      high mountain barrier stretches like a bulwark in front of our country
      down towards Boeotia—cleft, moreover, by narrow and precipitous
      passes, the only avenues into the heart of Attica, which lies engirdled by
      a ring of natural fortresses? (31)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (31) The mountains are Cithaeron and Parnes N., and Cerata N.W.

    <p>
      Per. Certainly I have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well, and have you ever heard tell of the Mysians and Pisidians
      living within the territory of the great king, (32) who, inside their
      mountain fortresses, lightly armed, are able to rush down and inflict much
      injury on the king's territory by their raids, while preserving their own
      freedom?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (32) For this illustration see "Anab." III. ii. 23; cf. "Econ." iv.

    <p>
      Per. Yes, the circumstance is not new to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      And do you not think (added Socrates) that a corps of young able-bodied
      Athenians, accoutred with lighter arms, (33) and holding our natural
      mountain rampart in possession, would prove at once a thorn in the enemy's
      side offensively, whilst defensively they would form a splendid bulwark to
      protect the country?

      decidedly.

    <p>
      If, then (replied Socrates), these suggestions meet your approbation, try,
      O best of men, to realise them—if you can carry out a portion of
      them, it will be an honour to yourself and a blessing to the state; while,
      if you fail in any point, there will be no damage done to the city nor
      discredit to yourself.

      VI
    </p>
    <p>
      Glaucon, (1) the son of Ariston, had conceived such an ardour to gain the
      headship of the state that nothing could hinder him but he must deliver a
      course of public speeches, (2) though he had not yet reached the age of
      twenty. His friends and relatives tried in vain to stop him making himself
      ridiculous and being dragged down from the bema. (3) Socrates, who took a
      kindly interest in the youth for the sake of Charmides (4) the son of
      Glaucon, and of Plato, alone succeeded in restraining him. It happened
      thus. He fell in with him, and first of all, to get him to listen,
      detained him by some such remarks as the following: (5)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (1) Glaucon, Plato's brother. Grote, "Plato," i. 508.

 (2) "Harangue the People."

 (3) See Plat. "Protag." 319 C: "And if some person offers to give them
    advice who is not supposed by them to have any skill in the art
     (sc. of politics), even though he be good-looking, and rich, and
    noble, they will not listen to him, but laugh at him, and hoot
    him, until he is either clamoured down and retires of himself; or
    if he persists, he is dragged away or put out by the constables at
    the command of the prytanes" (Jowett). Cf. Aristoph. "Knights,"
    665, {kath eilkon auton oi prutaneis kai toxotai}.

 (4) For Charmides (maternal uncle of Plato and Glaucon, cousin of
    Critias) see ch. vii. below; Plato the philosopher, Glaucon's
    brother, see Cobet, "Pros. Xen." p. 28.

 (5) Or, "and in the first instance addressing him in such terms he
    could not choose but hear, detained him." See above, II. vi. 11.
    Socrates applies his own theory.
</pre>
    <p>
      Ah, Glaucon (he exclaimed), so you have determined to become prime
      minister? (6)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (6) {prostateuein}.
</pre>
    <p>
      Glauc. Yes, Socrates, I have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And what a noble aim! if aught human ever deserved to be called
      noble; since if you succeed in your design, it follows, as the night the
      day, you will be able not only to gratify your every wish, but you will be
      in a position to benefit your friends, you will raise up your father's
      house, you will exalt your fatherland, you will become a name thrice
      famous in the city first, and next in Hellas, and lastly even among
      barbarians perhaps, like Themistocles; but be it here or be it there,
      wherever you be, you will be the observed of all beholders. (7)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (7) "The centre of attraction—the cynosure of neighbouring eyes."
</pre>
    <p>
      The heart of Glaucon swelled with pride as he drank in the words, and
      gladly he stayed to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Socrates proceeded: Then this is clear, Glaucon, is it not? that
      you must needs benefit the city, since you desire to reap her honours?
    </p>
    <p>
      Glauc. Undoubtedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, by all that is sacred (Socrates continued), do not keep us in the
      dark, but tell us in what way do you propose first to benefit the state?
      what is your starting-point? (8) When Glaucon remained with sealed lips,
      as if he were now for the first time debating what this starting-point
      should be, Socrates continued: I presume, if you wished to improve a
      friend's estate, you would endeavour to do so by adding to its wealth,
      would you not? So here, maybe, you will try to add to the wealth of the
      state?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (8) Or, "tell us what your starting-point will be in the path of
    benefaction."
</pre>
    <p>
      Most decidedly (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And we may take it the state will grow wealthier in proportion as her
      revenues increase?
    </p>
    <p>
      Glauc. That seems probable, at any rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then would you kindly tell us from what sources the revenues of the
      state are at present derived, and what is their present magnitude? No
      doubt you have gone carefully into the question, so that if any of these
      are failing you may make up the deficit, or if neglected for any reason,
      make some new provision. (9)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (9) Or, "or if others have dropped out or been negligently overlooked,
    you may replace them."
</pre>
    <p>
      Glauc. Nay, to speak the truth, these are matters I have not thoroughly
      gone into.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never mind (he said) if you have omitted the point; but you might oblige
      us by running through the items or heads of expenditure. Obviously you
      propose to remove all those which are superfluous?
    </p>
    <p>
      Glauc. Well, no. Upon my word I have not had time to look into that side
      of the matter either as yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then we will postpone for the present the problem of making the state
      wealthier; obviously without knowing the outgoings and the incomings it
      would be impossible to deal with the matter seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, Socrates (Glaucon remarked), it is possible to enrich the state out
      of the pockets of her enemies!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, to be sure, considerably (answered Socrates), in the event of getting
      the better of them; but in the event of being worsted, it is also possible
      to lose what we have got.
    </p>
    <p>
      A true observation (he replied).
    </p>
    <p>
      And therefore (proceeded Socrates), before he makes up his mind with what
      enemy to go to war, a statesman should know the relative powers of his own
      city and the adversary's, so that, in case the superiority be on his own
      side, he may throw the weight of his advice into the scale of undertaking
      war; but if the opposite he may plead in favour of exercising caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are right (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then would you for our benefit enumerate the land and naval forces
      first of Athens and then of our opponents?
    </p>
    <p>
      Glauc. Pardon me. I could not tell you them off-hand at a moment's notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or (added Socrates), if you have got the figures on paper, you might
      produce them. I cannot tell how anxious I am to hear your statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glauc. No, I assure you, I have not got them even on paper yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well then, we will defer tending advice on the topic of peace or war,
      in a maiden speech at any rate. (10) I can understand that, owing to the
      magnitude of the questions, in these early days of your ministry you have
      not yet fully examined them. But come, I am sure that you have studied the
      defences of the country, at all events, and you know exactly how many
      forts and outposts are serviceable (11) and how many are not; you can tell
      us which garrisons are strong enough and which defective; and you are
      prepared to throw in the weight of your advice in favour of increasing the
      serviceable outposts and sweeping away those that are superfluous?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (10) See "Econ." xi. 1.

 (11) Or, "advantageously situated." See the author's own tract on
    "Revenues."
</pre>
    <p>
      Glauc. Yes, sweep them all away, that's my advice; for any good that is
      likely to come of them! Defences indeed! so maintained that the property
      of the rural districts is simply pilfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suppose you sweep away the outposts (he asked), may not something
      worse, think you, be the consequence? will not sheer plundering be free to
      any ruffian who likes?... But may I ask is this judgment the result of
      personal inspection? have you gone yourself and examined the defences? or
      how do you know that they are all maintained as you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      Glauc. I conjecture that it is so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well then, until we have got beyond the region of conjecture shall we
      defer giving advice on the matter? (It will be time enough when we know
      the facts.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly it would be better to wait till then (replied Glaucon).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then there are the mines, (12) but, of course, I am aware that you
      have not visited them in person, so as to be able to say why they are less
      productive than formerly.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (12) Again the author's tract on "Revenues" is a comment on the
    matter.
</pre>
    <p>
      Well, no; I have never been there myself (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. No, Heaven help us! an unhealthy district by all accounts; so that,
      when the moment for advice on that topic arrives, you will have an excuse
      ready to hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I see you are making fun of me (Glaucon answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well, but here is a point, I am sure, which you have not neglected.
      No, you will have thoroughly gone into it, and you can tell us. For how
      long a time could the corn supplies from the country districts support the
      city? how much is requisite for a single year, so that the city may not
      run short of this prime necessary, before you are well aware; but on the
      contrary you with your full knowledge will be in a position to give advice
      on so vital a question, to the aid or may be the salvation of your
      country?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a colossal business this (Glaucon answered), if I am to be obliged
      to give attention to all these details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. On the other hand, a man could not even manage his own house or his
      estate well, without, in the first place, knowing what he requires, and,
      in the second place, taking pains, item by item, to supply his wants. But
      since this city consists of more than ten thousand houses, and it is not
      easy to pay minute attention to so many all at once, how is it you did not
      practise yourself by trying to augment the resources of one at any rate of
      these—I mean your own uncle's? The service would not be thrown away.
      Then if your strength suffices in the single case you might take in hand a
      larger number; but if you fail to relieve one, how could you possibly hope
      to succeed with many? How absurd for a man, if he cannot carry half a
      hundredweight, to attempt to carry a whole! (13)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (13) Lit. "a single talent's weight... to carry two."
</pre>
    <p>
      Glauc. Nay, for my part, I am willing enough to assist my uncle's house,
      if my uncle would only be persuaded to listen to my advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then, when you cannot persuade your uncle, do you imagine you will be
      able to make the whole Athenian people, uncle and all, obey you? Be
      careful, Glaucon (he added), lest in your thirst for glory and high repute
      you come to the opposite. Do you not see how dangerous it is for a man to
      speak or act beyond the range (14) of his knowledge? To take the cases
      known to you of people whose conversation or conduct clearly transcends
      these limits: should you say they gain more praise or more blame on that
      account? Are they admired the rather or despised? Or, again, consider
      those who do know what they say and what they do; and you will find, I
      venture to say, that in every sort of undertaking those who enjoy repute
      and admiration belong to the class of those endowed with the highest
      knowledge; whilst conversely the people of sinister reputation, the mean
      and the contemptible, emanate from some depth of ignorance and dulness. If
      therefore what you thirst for is repute and admiration as a statesman, try
      to make sure of one accomplishment: in other words, the knowledge as far
      as in you lies of what you wish to do. (15) If, indeed, with this to
      distinguish you from the rest of the world you venture to concern yourself
      with state affairs, it would not surprise me but that you might reach the
      goal of your ambition easily.

      Now Charmides, (1) the son of Glaucon, was, as Socrates observed, a man of
      mark and influence: a much more powerful person in fact than the mass of
      those devoted to politics at that date, but at the same time he was a man
      who shrank from approaching the people or busying himself with the
      concerns of the state. Accordingly Socrates addressed him thus:

<pre xml:space="preserve"> (1) See last chapter for his relationship to Glaucon (the younger) and
    Plato; for a conception of his character, Plato's dialogue

    Grote, "Plato," i. 480.

      Tell me, Charmides, supposing some one competent to win a victory in the
      arena and to receive a crown, (2) whereby he will gain honour himself and
      make the land of his fathers more glorious in Hellas, (3) were to refuse
      to enter the lists—what kind of person should you set him down to
      be?

      as a coward?

      hesitate to devote yourself to matters which, as being a citizen, if for
      no other reason, you are bound to take part in. (4)

      you meet the politicians of the day, when, as I observe, each time they

      they make a blunder you lay your finger on the weak point immediately.

      Soc. Yes, but what I am bent on teaching you is that while you feel no
      such bashfulness and timidity before the wisest and strongest of men, you
      are ashamed of opening your lips in the midst of weaklings and dullards.
      (6) Is it the fullers among them of whom you stand in awe, or the
      cobblers, or the carpenters, or the coppersmiths, or the merchants, or the

      foremost statesmen in the city, some of whom affect to look down upon you—you,
      with your vast superiority over practised popular debaters—are no
      sooner confronted with a set of folk who never in their lives gave

      up against a set of commoners. (9) My good fellow, do not be ignorant of

      Once when Aristippus (1) set himself to subject Socrates to a
      cross-examination, such as he had himself undergone at the hands of
      Socrates on a former occasion, (2) Socrates, being minded to benefit those
      who were with him, gave his answers less in the style of a debater
      guarding against perversions of his argument, than of a man persuaded of
      the supreme importance of right conduct. (3)

    <p>
      Aristippus asked him "if he knew of anything good," (4) intending in case
      he assented and named any particular good thing, like food or drink, or
      wealth, or health, or strength, or courage, to point out that the thing
      named was sometimes bad. But he, knowing that if a thing troubles us, we
      immediately want that which will put an end to our trouble, answered
      precisely as it was best to do. (5)

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Aristip. No, nor yet that.

    </p>
    <p>
      Aristip. No, nor yet for hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, but (answered Socrates) if you ask me whether I know of any good
      thing which is good for nothing, I neither know of it nor want to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Aristippus, returning to the charge, asked him "if he knew of any
      thing beautiful."
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered: Yes, many things.
    </p>

    <p>
      Soc. On the contrary, they are often as unlike as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      How then (he asked) can that be beautiful which is unlike the beautiful?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Bless me! for the simple reason that it is possible for a man who is
      a beautiful runner to be quite unlike another man who is a beautiful
      boxer, (6) or for a shield, which is a beautiful weapon for the purpose of
      defence, to be absolutely unlike a javelin, which is a beautiful weapon of

      all things are at once beautiful and good? (8) In the first place, virtue
      is not a good thing relatively to one standard and a beautiful thing
      relatively to another standard; and in the next place, human beings, on
      the same principle (9) and relatively to the same standard, are called
      "beautiful and good"; and so the bodily frames of men relatively to the
      same standards are seen to be "beautiful and good," and in general all
      things capable of being used by man are regarded as at once beautiful and
      good relatively to the same standard—the standing being in each case
      what the thing happens to be useful for. (10)

    <p>
      Aristip. Do you mean to assert that the same things may be beautiful and
      ugly?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Yes, to be sure; and by the same showing things may be good and bad:
      as, for instance, what is good for hunger may be bad for fever, and what
      is good for fever bad for hunger; or again, what is beautiful for
      wrestling is often ugly for running; and in general everything is good and
      beautiful when well adapted for the end in view, bad and ugly when ill
      adapted for the same.

      Similarly when he spoke about houses, (12) and argued that "the same house
      must be at once beautiful and useful"—I could not help feeling that
      he was giving a good lesson on the problem: "how a house ought to be
      built." He investigated the matter thus:

      under the verandah, (15) but in summer, when the sun traverses a path
      right over our heads, the roof will afford an agreeable shade, will it
      not? If, then, such an arrangement is desirable, the southern side of a
      house should be built higher to catch the rays of the winter sun, and the
      northern side lower to prevent the cold winds finding ingress; in a word,
      it is reasonable to suppose that the pleasantest and most beautiful

      Being again asked by some one: could courage be taught, (1) or did it come
      by nature? he answered: I imagine that just as one body is by nature
      stronger than another body to encounter toils, so one soul by nature grows
      more robust than another soul in face of dangers. Certainly I do note that
      people brought up under the same condition of laws and customs differ
      greatly in respect of daring. Still my belief is that by learning and
      practice the natural aptitude may always be strengthened towards courage.
      It is clear, for instance, that Scythians or Thracians would not venture
      to take shield and spear and contend with Lacedaemonians; and it is
      equally evident that Lacedaemonians would demur to entering the lists of
      battle against Thracians if limited to their light shields and javelins,
      or against Scythians without some weapon more familiar than their bows and
      arrows. (2) And as far as I can see, this principle holds generally: the
      natural differences of one man from another may be compensated by
      artificial progress, the result of care and attention. All which proves
      clearly that whether nature has endowed us with keener or blunter
      sensibilities, the duty of all alike is to learn and practise those things
      in which we would fain achieve distinction.

      Between wisdom and sobriety of soul (which is temperance) he drew no
      distinction. (3) Was a man able on the one hand to recognise things
      beautiful and good sufficiently to live in them? Had he, on the other
      hand, knowledge of the "base and foul" so as to beware of them? If so,
      Socrates judged him to be wise at once and sound of soul (or temperate).

      And being further questioned whether "he considered those who have the
      knowledge of right action, but do not apply it, to be wise and
      self-controlled?"—"Not a whit more," he answered, "than I consider
      them to be unwise and intemperate. (5) Every one, I conceive, deliberately
      chooses what, within the limits open to him, he considers most conducive
      to his interest, and acts accordingly. I must hold therefore that those
      who act against rule and crookedly (6) are neither wise nor
      self-controlled.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (5) For the phrase "not a whit the more" see below, III. xii. 1;

 (6) "Who cannot draw a straight line, ethically speaking."

      He said that justice, moreover, and all other virtue is wisdom. That is to
      say, things just, and all things else that are done with virtue, are
      "beautiful and good"; and neither will those who know these things
      deliberately choose aught else in their stead, nor will he who lacks the
      special knowledge of them be able to do them, but even if he makes the
      attempt he will miss the mark and fail. So the wise alone can perform the
      things which are "beautiful and good"; they that are unwise cannot, but
      even if they try they fail. Therefore, since all things just, and
      generally all things "beautiful and good," are wrought with virtue, it is
      clear that justice and all other virtue is wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, madness (he maintained) was the opposite to wisdom; not
      that he regarded simple ignorance as madness, (7) but he put it thus: for
      a man to be ignorant of himself, to imagine and suppose that he knows what
      he knows not, was (he argued), if not madness itself, yet something very
      like it. The mass of men no doubt hold a different language: if a man is
      all abroad on some matter of which the mass of mankind are ignorant, they
      do not pronounce him "mad"; (8) but a like aberration of mind, if only it
      be about matters within the scope of ordinary knowledge, they call
      madness. For instance, any one who imagined himself too tall to pass under
      a gateway of the Long Wall without stooping, or so strong as to try to
      lift a house, or to attempt any other obvious impossibility, is a madman
      according to them; but in the popular sense he is not mad, if his
      obliquity is confined to small matters. In fact, just as strong desire
      goes by the name of passion in popular parlance, so mental obliquity on a
      grand scale is entitled madness.

      In answer to the question: what is envy? he discovered it to be a certain
      kind of pain; not certainly the sorrow felt at the misfortunes of a friend
      or the good fortune of an enemy—that is not envy; but, as he said,
      "envy is felt by those alone who are annoyed at the successes of their
      friends." And when some one or other expressed astonishment that any one
      friendlily disposed to another should be pained at his well-doing, he
      reminded him of a common tendency in people: when any one is faring ill
      their sympathies are touched, they rush to the aid of the unfortunate; but
      when fortune smiles on others, they are somehow pained. "I do not say," he
      added, "this could happen to a thoughtful person; but it is no uncommon
      condition of a silly mind." (9)

      turn and do something better; but nobody has leisure to turn from the
      better to the worse, and if he does so turn, when he has no leisure, he
      does but ill in that.

      by fraud; but those who have the special knowledge (13) how to rule. Thus
      having won the admission that it is the function of a ruler to enjoin what
      ought to be done, and of those who are ruled to obey, he proceeded to
      point out by instances that in a ship the ruler or captain is the man of
      special knowledge, to whom, as an expert, the shipowner himself and all
      the others on board obey. So likewise, in the matter of husbandry, the
      proprietor of an estate; in that of sickness, the patient; in that of
      physical training of the body, the youthful athlete going through a
      course; and, in general, every one directly concerned in any matter
      needing attention and care will either attend to this matter personally,
      if he thinks he has the special knowledge; or, if he mistrusts his own
      science, will be eager to obey any expert on the spot, or will even send
      and fetch one from a distance. The guidance of this expert he will follow,
      and do what he has to do at his dictation.

      word of good advice, he will fall into error, I presume, and falling into
      error, be punished." And to the suggestion that the tyrant could, if he
      liked, cut off the head of the man of wisdom, his answer was: "Do you
      think that he who destroys his best ally will go scot free, or suffer a
      mere slight and passing loss? Is he more likely to secure his salvation

      When some one asked him: "What he regarded as the best pursuit or business
      (15) for a man?" he answered: "Successful conduct"; (16) and to a second
      question: "Did he then regard good fortune as an end to be pursued?"—"On
      the contrary," he answered, "for myself, I consider fortune and conduct to
      be diametrically opposed. For instance, to succeed in some desirable
      course of action without seeking to do so, I hold to be good fortune; but
      to do a thing well by dint of learning and practice, that according to my
      creed is successful conduct, (17) and those who make this the serious

      possessed of an art, and using it for daily purposes of business, he never
      failed to be useful to this kind of person. For instance, stepping one

      I suppose, Parrhasius (said he), painting may be defined as "a
      representation of visible objects," may it not? (3) That is to say, by
      means of colours and palette you painters represent and reproduce as
      closely as possible the ups and downs, lights and shadows, hard and soft,

      Well, but stop (Socrates continued); do you also pretend to represent in
      similar perfection the characteristic moods of the soul, its captivating
      charm and sweetness, with its deep wells of love, its intensity of
      yearning, its burning point of passion? or is all this quite incapable of
      being depicted?

    <p>
      Nay (he answered), how should a mood be other than inimitable, Socrates,
      when it possesses neither linear proportion (6) nor colour, nor any of
      those qualities which you named just now; when, in a word, it is not even

      stands or moves, a glimpse of his nobility and freedom, or again of
      something in him low and grovelling—the calm of self-restraint, and
      wisdom, or the swagger of insolence and vulgarity?

      At another time he entered the workshop of the sculptor Cleiton, (9) and
      in course of conversation with him said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (9) An unknown artist. Coraes conj. {Kleona}. Cf. Plin. xxxiv. 19;
    Paus. v. 17, vi. 3. He excelled in portrait statues. See Jowett,
    "Plato," iv.; "Laws," p. 123.
</pre>
    <p>
      You have a gallery of handsome people here, (10) Cleiton, runners, and
      wrestlers, and boxers, and pancratiasts—that I see and know; but how
      do you give the magic touch of life to your creations, which most of all
      allures the soul of the beholder through his sense of vision?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (10) Reading after L. Dind. {kaloi ous}, or if vulg. {alloious},
    translate "You have a variety of types, Cleiton, not all of one
    mould, but runners," etc.; al. "I see quite well how you give the
    diversity of form to your runners," etc.
</pre>
    <p>
      As Cleiton stood perplexed, and did not answer at once, Socrates added: Is
      it by closely imitating the forms of living beings that you succeed in
      giving that touch of life to your statues?
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. It is, is it not, by faithfully copying the various muscular
      contractions of the body in obedience to the play of gesture and poise,
      the wrinklings of flesh and the sprawl of limbs, the tensions and the
      relaxations, that you succeed in making your statues like real beings—make
      them "breathe" as people say?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cleit. Without a doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And does not the faithful imitation of the various affections of the
      body when engaged in any action impart a particular pleasure to the
      beholder?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cleit. I should say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then the threatenings in the eyes of warriors engaged in battle
      should be carefully copied, or again you should imitate the aspect of a
      conqueror radiant with success?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cleit. Above all things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. It would seem then that the sculptor is called upon to incorporate in
      his ideal form the workings and energies also of the soul?
    </p>
    <p>
      Paying a visit to Pistias, (11) the corselet maker, when that artist
      showed him some exquisite samples of his work, Socrates exclaimed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (11) Cf. Athen. iv. 20, where the same artist is referred to
    apparently as {Piston}, and for the type of person see the
    "Portrait of a Tailor" by Moroni in the National Gallery—see
    "Handbook," Edw. T. Cook, p. 152.
</pre>
    <p>
      By Hera! a pretty invention this, Pistias, by which you contrive that the
      corselet should cover the parts of the person which need protection, and
      at the same time leave free play to the arms and hands.... but tell me,
      Pistias (he added), why do you ask a higher price for these corselets of
      yours if they are not stouter or made of costlier material than the
      others?
    </p>
    <p>
      Because, Socrates (he answered), mine are of much finer proportion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Proportion! Then how do you make this quality apparent to the
      customer so as to justify the higher price—by measure or weight? For
      I presume you cannot make them all exactly equal and of one pattern—if
      you make them fit, as of course you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Fit indeed! that I most distinctly do (he answered), take my word for it:
      no use in a corselet without that.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then are not the wearer's bodies themselves (asked Socrates) some well
      proportioned and others ill?
    </p>
    <p>
      Decidedly so (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then how do you manage to make the corselet well proportioned if it
      is to fit an ill-proportioned body? (12)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (12) Or, "how do you make a well-proportioned corselet fit an ill-
      proportioned body? how well proportioned?"
</pre>
    <p>
      Pist. To the same degree exactly as I make it fit. What fits is well
      proportioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. It seems you use the term "well-proportioned" not in an absolute
      sense, but in reference to the wearer, just as you might describe a shield
      as well proportioned to the individual it suits; and so of a military
      cloak, and so of the rest of things, in your terminology? But maybe there
      is another considerable advantage in this "fitting"?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pist. Pray instruct me, Socrates, if you have got an idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. A corselet which fits is less galling by its weight than one which
      does not fit, for the latter must either drag from the shoulders with a
      dead weight or press upon some other part of the body, and so it becomes
      troublesome and uncomfortable; but that which fits, having its weight
      distributed partly along the collar-bone and shoulder-blade, partly over
      the shoulders and chest, and partly the back and belly, feels like another
      natural integument rather than an extra load to carry. (13)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (13) Schneider ad loc. cf Eur. "Electr." 192, {prosthemata aglaias},
    and for the weight cf. Aristoph. "Peace," 1224.
</pre>
    <p>
      Pist. You have named the very quality which gives my work its exceptional
      value, as I consider; still there are customers, I am bound to say, who
      look for something else in a corselet—they must have them ornamental
      or inlaid with gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all that (replied Socrates), if they end by purchasing an ill-fitting
      article, they only become the proprietors of a curiously-wrought and
      gilded nuisance, as it seems to me. But (he added), as the body is never
      in one fixed position, but is at one time curved, at another raised erect
      how can an exactly-modelled corselet fit?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pist. It cannot fit at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      You mean (Socrates continued) that it is not the exactly-modelled corselet
      which fits, but that which does not gall the wearer in the using?
    </p>
    <p>
      Pist. There, Socrates, you have hit the very point. I see you understand
      the matter most precisely. (14)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (14) Or, "There, Socrates, you have hit the very phrase. I could not
    state the matter more explicitly myself."

      There was once in the city a fair woman named Theodote. (1) She was not
      only fair, but ready to consort with any suitor who might win her favour.
      Now it chanced that some one of the company mentioned her, saying that her
      beauty beggared description. "So fair is she," he added, "that painters
      flock to draw her portrait, to whom, within the limits of decorum, she
      displays the marvels of her beauty." "Then there is nothing for it but to
      go and see her," answered Socrates, "since to comprehend by hearsay what
      is beyond description is clearly impossible." Then he who had introduced
      the matter replied: "Be quick then to follow me"; and on this wise they
      set off to seek Theodote. They found her "posing" to a certain painter;
      and they took their stand as spectators. Presently the painter had ceased
      his work; whereupon Socrates:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (1) For Theodote see Athen. v. 200 F, xiii. 574 F; Liban. i. 582. Some
    say that it was Theodote who stood by Alcibiades to the last,
    though there are apparently other better claimants to the honour.
    Plut. "Alc." (Clough, ii. p. 50).
</pre>
    <p>
      "Do you think, sirs, that we ought to thank Theodote for displaying her
      beauty to us, or she us for coming to gaze at her?... It would seem, would
      it not, that if the exhibition of her charms is the more profitable to
      her, the debt is on her side; but if the spectacle of her beauty confers
      the greater benefit on us, then we are her debtors."
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one answered that "was an equitable statement of the case."
    </p>
    <p>
      Well then (he continued), as far as she is concerned, the praise we bestow
      on her is an immediate gain; and presently, when we have spread her fame
      abroad, she will be further benefited; but for ourselves the immediate
      effect on us is a strong desire to touch what we have seen; by and by,
      too, we shall go away with a sting inside us, and when we are fairly gone
      we shall be consumed with longing. Consequently it seems that we should do
      her service and she accept our court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Theodote: Oh dear! if that is how the matter stands, it is I who
      am your debtor for the spectacle. (2)

    you for coming to look at me."

      At this point, seeing that the lady herself was expensively attired, and
      that she had with her her mother also, whose dress and style of attendance
      (3) were out of the common, not to speak of the waiting-women—many
      and fair to look upon, who presented anything but a forlorn appearance;
      while in every respect the whole house itself was sumptuously furnished—Socrates
      put a question:

    <p>
      Soc. By heaven, Theodote, a very fine property indeed, and far better
      worth possessing than a multitude of sheep or goats or cattle. A flock of
      friends!... But (he added) do you leave it to fortune whether a friend
      lights like a fly on your hand at random, or do you use any artifice (6)

      of all game—a lover, to wit—in so artless a fashion? Do you
      not see (to speak of a much less noble sort of game) what a number of
      devices are needed to bag a hare? (8) The creatures range for their food
      at night; therefore the hunter must provide himself with night dogs. At
      peep of dawn they are off as fast as they can run. He must therefore have
      another pack of dogs to scent out and discover which way they betake them
      from their grazing ground to their forms; (9) and as they are so fleet of
      foot that they run and are out of sight in no time, he must once again be
      provided with other fleet-footed dogs to follow their tracks and overtake
      them; (10) and as some of them will give even these the slip, he must,
      last of all, set up nets on the paths at the points of escape, so that
      they may fall into the meshes and be caught.

      up your wealthy lover of beauty and discover his lair, and having found
      him, will plot and plan to throw him into your meshes?

      your own person; and inside it sits a soul that teaches you (12) with what
      looks to please and with what words to cheer; how, too, with smiles you
      are to welcome true devotion, but to exclude all wantons from your
      presence. (13) It tells you, you are to visit your beloved in sickness
      with solicitude, and when he has wrought some noble deed you are greatly
      to rejoice with him; and to one who passionately cares for you, you are to
      make surrender of yourself with heart and soul. The secret of true love I
      am sure you know: not to love softly merely, but devotedly. (14) And of
      this too I am sure: you can convince your lovers of your fondness for them
      not by lip phrases, but by acts of love.

      being in the natural and true way, since it is not by force certainly that
      you can either catch or keep a friend. Kindness and pleasure are the only
      means to capture this fearful wild-fowl man and keep him constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theod. You are right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. In the first place you must make such demands only of your
      well-wisher as he can grant without repentance; and in the next place you
      must make requital, dispensing your favours with a like economy. Thus you
      will best make friends whose love shall last the longest and their
      generosity know no stint. (15) And for your favours you will best win your
      friends if you suit your largess to their penury; for, mark you, the
      sweetest viands presented to a man before he wants them are apt to prove
      insipid, or, to one already sated, even nauseous; but create hunger, and

    <p>
      Soc. In the first place you must not offer or make suggestion of your
      dainties to jaded appetites until satiety has ceased and starvation cries
      for alms. Even then shall you make but a faint suggestion to their want,
      with modest converse—like one who would fain bestow a kindness...
      and lo! the vision fades and she is gone—until the very pinch of
      hunger; for the same gifts have then a value unknown before the moment of
      supreme desire.

      huntsman's assistant) to help me catch my friends and lovers?

      Theod. Come then in hither and visit me often.

    <p>
      And Socrates, poking sly fun at his own lack of business occupation,
      answered: Nay, Theodote, leisure is not a commodity in which I largely
      deal. I have a hundred affairs of my own too, private or public, to occupy
      me; and then there are my lady-loves, my dear friends, who will not suffer
      me day or night to leave them, for ever studying to learn love-charms and
      incantations at my lips.

      Soc. As little of an amateur, I take it, as any one who ever entered the
      lists of Olympia, unless you are prepared to make light of that contest
      for life and death against the public foe which the Athenians will
      institute when the day comes. (3) And yet they are not a few who, owing to
      a bad habit of body, either perish outright in the perils of war, or are
      ignobly saved. Many are they who for the self-same cause are taken
      prisoners, and being taken must, if it so betide, endure the pains of
      slavery for the rest of their days; or, after falling into dolorous
      straits, (4) when they have paid to the uttermost farthing of all, or may
      be more than the worth of all, that they possess, must drag on a miserable
      existence in want of the barest necessaries until death release them. Many
      also are they who gain an evil repute through infirmity of body, being
      thought to play the coward. Can it be that you despise these penalties
      affixed to an evil habit? Do you think you could lightly endure them? Far
      lighter, I imagine, nay, pleasant even by comparison, are the toils which
      he will undergo who duly cultivates a healthy bodily condition. Or do you
      maintain that the evil habit is healthier, and in general more useful than
      the good? Do you pour contempt upon those blessings which flow from the
      healthy state? And yet the very opposite of that which befalls the ill
      attends the sound condition. Does not the very soundness imply at once
      health and strength? (5) Many a man with no other talisman than this has
      passed safely through the ordeal of war; stepping, not without dignity,
      (6) through all its horrors unscathed. Many with no other support than
      this have come to the rescue of friends, or stood forth as benefactors of
      their fatherland; whereby they were thought worthy of gratitude, and
      obtained a great renown and received as a recompense the highest honours
      of the State; to whom is also reserved a happier and brighter passage
      through what is left to them of life, and at their death they leave to
      their children the legacy of a fairer starting-point in the race of life.

      Because our city does not practise military training in public, (7) that
      is no reason for neglecting it in private, but rather a reason for making
      it a foremost care. For be you assured that there is no contest of any
      sort, nor any transaction, in which you will be the worse off for being
      well prepared in body; and in fact there is nothing which men do for which
      the body is not a help. In every demand, therefore, which can be laid upon
      the body it is much better that it should be in the best condition; since,
      even where you might imagine the claims upon the body to be slightest—in
      the act of reasoning—who does not know the terrible stumbles which
      are made through being out of health? It suffices to say that
      forgetfulness, and despondency, and moroseness, and madness take occasion
      often of ill-health to visit the intellectual faculties so severely as to
      expel all knowledge (8) from the brain. But he who is in good bodily
      plight has large security. He runs no risk of incurring any such
      catastrophe through ill-health at any rate; he has the expectation rather
      that a good habit must procure consequences the opposite to those of an
      evil habit; (9) and surely to this end there is nothing a man in his
      senses would not undergo.... It is a base thing for a man to wax old in
      careless self-neglect before he has lifted up his eyes and seen what
      manner of man he was made to be, in the full perfection of bodily strength
      and beauty. But these glories are withheld from him who is guilty of
      self-neglect, for they are not wont to blaze forth unbidden. (10)

      soul somewhat boorishly disposed, you feel annoyed."

      To the remark of another who complained that he did not take his food with

      in its favour." (2)

      from Athens to Olympia? I would recommend you, however, to set off a day
      too soon rather than a day too late. To be forced to lengthen the day's
      journey beyond a reasonable amount may well be a nuisance; but to take one

      On the occasion of a common dinner-party (1) where some of the company
      would present themselves with a small, and others with a large supply of
      viands, Socrates would bid the servants (2) throw the small supplies into
      the general stock, or else to help each of the party to a share all round.
      Thus the grand victuallers were ashamed in the one case not to share in
      the common stock, and in the other not to throw in their supplies also.
      (3) Accordingly in went the grand supplies into the common stock. And now,
      being no better off than the small contributors, they soon ceased to cater
      for expensive delicacies.

      At a supper-party one member of the company, as Socrates chanced to note,
      had put aside the plain fare and was devoting himself to certain dainties.
      (4) A discussion was going on about names and definitions, and the proper
      applications of terms to things. (5) Whereupon Socrates, appealing to the
      company: "Can we explain why we call a man a 'dainty fellow'? What is the
      particular action to which the term applies? (6)—since every one
      adds some dainty to his food when he can get it. (7) But we have not quite
      hit the definition yet, I think. Are we to be called dainty eaters because
      we like our bread buttered?" (8)

    "epicure"; but how to define a gourmand?

</pre>
    <p>
      No! hardly! (some member of the company replied).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well, but now suppose a man confine himself to eating venison or
      other dainty without any plain food at all, not as a matter of training,
      (9) but for the pleasure of it: has such a man earned the title? "The rest
      of the world would have a poor chance against him," (10) some one
      answered. "Or," interposed another, "what if the dainty dishes he devours
      are out of all proportion to the rest of his meal—what of him?" (11)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (9) Lit. "{opson} (relish) by itself, not for the sake of training,"
    etc. The English reader wil bear in mind that a raw beefsteak or
    other meat prescribed by the gymnastic trainer in preference to
    farinaceous food ({sitos}) would be {opson}.

 (10) Or, more lit. "Hardly any one could deserve the appellation
    better."

 (11) Lit. "and what of the man who eats much {opson} on the top of a
    little ({sitos})?" {epesthion} = follows up one course by another,
    like the man in a fragment of Euripides, "Incert." 98: {kreasi
    boeiois khlora suk' epesthien}, who "followed up his beefsteak
    with a garnish of green figs."
</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. He has established a very fair title at any rate to the appellation,
      and when the rest of the world pray to heaven for a fine harvest: "May our
      corn and oil increase!" he may reasonably ejaculate, "May my fleshpots
      multiply!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this last sally the young man, feeling that the conversation set
      somewhat in his direction, did not desist indeed from his savoury viands,
      but helped himself generously to a piece of bread. Socrates was
      all-observant, and added: Keep an eye on our friend yonder, you others
      next him, and see fair play between the sop and the sauce. (12)
    </p>

      Another time, seeing one of the company using but one sop of bread (13) to
      test several savoury dishes, he remarked: Could there be a more
      extravagant style of cookery, or more murderous to the dainty dishes
      themselves, than this wholesale method of taking so many dishes together?—why,
      bless me, twenty different sorts of seasoning at one swoop! (14) First of
      all he mixes up actually more ingredients than the cook himself
      prescribes, which is extravagant; and secondly, he has the audacity to
      commingle what the chef holds incongruous, whereby if the cooks are right
      in their method he is wrong in his, and consequently the destroyer of
      their art. Now is it not ridiculous first to procure the greatest virtuosi
      to cook for us, and then without any claim to their skill to take and
      alter their procedure? But there is a worse thing in store for the bold
      man who habituates himself to eat a dozen dishes at once: when there are
      but few dishes served, out of pure habit he will feel himself half
      starved, whilst his neighbour, accustomed to send his sop down by help of
      a single relish, will feast merrily, be the dishes never so few.

      He had a saying that {euokheisthai}, to "make good cheer," (15) was in
      Attic parlance a synonym for "eating," and the affix {eu} (the attributive
      "good") connoted the eating of such things as would not trouble soul or
      body, and were not far to seek or hard to find. So that to "make good
      cheer" in his vocabulary applied to a modest and well-ordered style of
      living. (16)

      Such was Socrates; so helpful under all circumstances and in every way
      that no observer, gifted with ordinary sensibility, could fail to
      appreciate the fact, that to be with Socrates, and to spend long time in
      his society (no matter where or what the circumstances), was indeed a
      priceless gain. Even the recollection of him, when he was no longer
      present, was felt as no small benefit by those who had grown accustomed to
      be with him, and who accepted him. Nor indeed was he less helpful to his
      acquaintance in his lighter than in his graver moods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us take as an example that saying of his, so often on his lips: "I am
      in love with so and so"; and all the while it was obvious the going-forth
      of his soul was not towards excellence of body in the bloom of beauty, but
      rather towards faculties of the soul unfolding in virtue. (1) And these
      "good natures" he detected by certain tokens: a readiness to learn that to
      which the attention was directed; a power of retaining in the memory the
      lessons learnt; and a passionate predilection for those studies in
      particular which serve to good administration of a house or of a state,
      (2) and in general to the proper handling of man and human affairs. Such
      beings, he maintained, needed only to be educated (3) to become not only
      happy themselves and happy administrators of their private households, but
      to be capable of rendering other human beings as states or individuals
      happy also.
    </p>

    as regards virtue; and this good natural disposition might be

      He had indeed a different way of dealing with different kinds of people.
      (4) Those who thought they had good natural ability and despised learning
      he instructed that the most highly-gifted nature stands most in need of
      training and education; (5) and he would point out how in the case of
      horses it is just the spirited and fiery thoroughbred which, if properly
      broken in as a colt, will develop into a serviceable and superb animal,
      but if left unbroken will turn out utterly intractable and good for
      nothing. Or take the case of dogs: a puppy exhibiting that zest for toil
      and eagerness to attack wild creatures which are the marks of high
      breeding, (6) will, if well brought up, prove excellent for the chase or
      for any other useful purpose; but neglect his education and he will turn
      out a stupid, crazy brute, incapable of obeying the simplest command. It
      is just the same with human beings; here also the youth of best natural
      endowments—that is to say, possessing the most robust qualities of
      spirit and a fixed determination to carry out whatever he has laid his
      hand to—will, if trained and taught what it is right to do, prove a
      superlatively good and useful man. He achieves, in fact, what is best upon
      the grandest scale. But leave him in boorish ignorance untrained, and he
      will prove not only very bad but very mischievous, (7) and for this
      reason, that lacking the knowledge to discern what is right to do, he will
      frequently lay his hand to villainous practices; whilst the very
      magnificence and vehemence of his character render it impossible either to
      rein him in or to turn him aside from his evil courses. Hence in his case
      also his achievements are on the grandest scale but of the worst. (8)

<pre xml:space="preserve"> (4) Or, "His method of attack was not indeed uniformly the same. It
    varied with the individual."

 (5) Or, "If any one was disposed to look down upon learning and study
    in reliance upon his own natural ability, he tried to lesson him
    that it is just the highly-gifted nature which stands," etc. See

      Or to take the type of person so eaten up with the pride of riches that he
      conceives himself dispensed from any further need of education—since
      it is "money makes the man," and his wealth will amply suffice him to
      carry out his desires and to win honours from admiring humanity. (9)
      Socrates would bring such people to their senses by pointing out the folly
      of supposing that without instruction it was possible to draw the line of
      demarcation (10) between what is gainful and what is hurtful in conduct;
      and the further folly of supposing that, apart from such discrimination, a
      man could help himself by means of wealth alone to whatever he liked or
      find the path of expediency plain before him; and was it not the veriest
      simplicity to suppose that, without the power of labouring profitably, a
      man can either be doing well or be in any sort of way sufficiently
      equipped for the battle of life? and again, the veriest simplicity to
      suppose that by mere wealth without true knowledge it was possible either
      to purchase a reputation for some excellence, or without such reputation
      to gain distinction and celebrity?

    </p>
    <p>
      Or to come to a third kind—the class of people who are persuaded
      that they have received the best education, and are proud of their wisdom:
      his manner of dealing with these I will now describe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Euthydemus (1) "the beautiful" had (Socrates was given to understand)
      collected a large library, consisting of the most celebrated poets and
      philosophers, (2) by help of which he already believed himself to be more
      than a match for his fellows in wisdom, and indeed might presently expect
      to out-top them all in capacity of speech and action. (3) At first, as
      Socrates noted, the young man by reason of his youth had not as yet set
      foot in the agora, (4) but if he had anything to transact, his habit was
      to seat himself in a saddler's shop hard by. Accordingly to this same
      saddler's shop Socrates betook himself with some of those who were with
      him. And first the question was started by some one: "Was it through
      consorting with the wise, (5) or by his own unaided talent, that
      Themistocles came so to surpass his fellow-citizens that when the services
      of a capable man were needed the eyes of the whole community instinctively
      turned to him?" Socrates, with a view to stirring (6) Euthydemus,
      answered: There was certainly an ingenuous simplicity in the belief that
      superiority in arts of comparatively little worth could only be attained
      by aid of qualified teachers, but that the leadership of the state, the
      most important concern of all, was destined to drop into the lap of
      anybody, no matter whom, like an accidental windfall. (7)

    <p>
      On a subsequent occasion, Euthydemus being present, though, as was plain
      to see, somewhat disposed to withdraw from the friendly concourse, (8) as
      if he would choose anything rather than appear to admire Socrates on the
      score of wisdom, the latter made the following remarks.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (8) {sunedrias}, "the council."
</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. It is clear from his customary pursuits, is it not, sirs, that when
      our friend Euthydemus here is of full age, and the state propounds some
      question for solution, he will not abstain from offering the benefit of
      his advice? One can imagine the pretty exordium to his parliamentary
      speeches which, in his anxiety not to be thought to have learnt anything
      from anybody, he has ready for the occasion. (9) Clearly at the outset he
      will deliver himself thus: "Men of Athens, I have never at any time learnt
      anything from anybody; nor, if I have ever heard of any one as being an
      able statesman, well versed in speech and capable of action, have I sought
      to come across him individually. I have not so much as been at pains to
      provide myself with a teacher from amongst those who have knowledge; (10)
      on the contrary, I have persistently avoided, I will not say learning from
      others, but the very faintest suspicion of so doing. However, anything
      that occurs to me by the light of nature I shall be glad to place at your
      disposal."... How appropriate (11) would such a preface sound on the lips
      of any one seeking, say, the office of state physician, (12) would it not?
      How advantageously he might begin an address on this wise: "Men of Athens,
      I have never learnt the art of healing by help of anybody, nor have I
      sought to provide myself with any teacher among medical men. Indeed, to
      put it briefly, I have been ever on my guard not only against learning
      anything from the profession, but against the very notion of having
      studied medicine at all. If, however, you will be so good as to confer on
      me this post, I promise I will do my best to acquire skill by
      experimenting on your persons." Every one present laughed at the exordium
      (and there the matter dropped).
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (9) Or, "the pretty exordium... now in course of composition. He
    must at all hazards avoid the suspicion of having picked up any
    crumb of learning from anybody; how can he help therefore
    beginning his speech thus?"

 (10) Or, "scientific experts."

 (11) Al. "Just as if one seeking the office of state physician were to
    begin with a like exordium." {armoseie} = "it would be consistent
    (with what has gone before)."

 (12) Schneider cf. Plat. "Laws," iv. 720 A; "Gorg." 456 A; and for
    "the parish doctor," "Polit." 259 A; Arist. "Acharn." 1030.
</pre>
    <p>
      Presently, when it became apparent that Euthydemus had got so far that he
      was disposed to pay attention to what was said, though he was still at
      pains not to utter a sound himself, as if he hoped by silence to attach to
      himself some reputation for sagacity, Socrates, wishing to cure him of
      that defect, proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Is it not surprising that people anxious to learn to play the harp or
      the flute, or to ride, or to become proficient in any like accomplishment,
      are not content to work unremittingly in private by themselves at whatever
      it is in which they desire to excel, but they must sit at the feet of the
      best-esteemed teachers, doing all things and enduring all things for the
      sake of following the judgment of those teachers in everything, as though
      they themselves could not otherwise become famous; whereas, among those
      who aspire to become eminent politically as orators and statesmen, (13)
      there are some who cannot see why they should not be able to do all that
      politics demand, at a moment's notice, by inspiration as it were, without
      any preliminary pains or preparations whatever? And yet it would appear
      that the latter concerns must be more difficult of achievement than the
      former, in proportion as there are more competitors in the field but fewer
      who reach the goal of their ambition, which is as much as to say that a
      more sustained effort of attention is needed on the part of those who
      embark upon the sea of politics than is elsewhere called for.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (13) Or, more lit. "powerful in speech and action within the sphere of
    politics."
</pre>
    <p>
      Such were the topics on which Socrates was wont in the early days of their
      association to dilate in the hearing of Euthydemus; but when the
      philosopher perceived that the youth not only could tolerate the turns of
      the discussion more readily but was now become a somewhat eager listener,
      he went to the saddler's shop alone, (14) and when Euthydemus was seated
      by his side the following conversation took place.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (14) The question arises: how far is the conversation historical or
    imaginary?
</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. Pray tell me, Euthydemus, is it really true what people tell me, that
      you have made a large collection of the writings of "the wise," as they
      are called? (15)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (15) Or, "have collected several works of our classical authors and
    philosophers."
</pre>
    <p>
      Euthydemus answered: Quite true, Socrates, and I mean to go on collecting
      until I possess all the books I can possibly lay hold of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. By Hera! I admire you for wishing to possess treasures of wisdom
      rather than of gold and silver, which shows that you do not believe gold
      and silver to be the means of making men better, but that the thoughts
      (16) of the wise alone enrich with virtue their possessions.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (16) Lit. "gnomes," maxims, sententiae. Cf. Aristot. "Rhet." ii. 21.
</pre>
    <p>
      And Euthydemus was glad when he heard that saying, for, thought he to
      himself, "In the eyes of Socrates I am on the high road to the acquisition
      of wisdom." But the latter, perceiving him to be pleased with the praise,
      continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And what is it in which you desire to excel, Euthydemus, that you
      collect books?
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Euthydemus was silent, considering what answer he should make,
      Socrates added: Possibly you want to be a great doctor? Why, the
      prescriptions (17) of the Pharmacopoeia would form a pretty large library
      by themselves.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (17) {suggrammata}, "medical treatises." See Aristot. "Eth." x. 9, 21.
</pre>
    <p>
      No, indeed, not I! (answered Euthydemus).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then do you wish to be an architect? That too implies a man of
      well-stored wit and judgment. (18)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (18) Or, "To be that implies a considerable store of well-packed
    wisdom."
</pre>
    <p>
      I have no such ambition (he replied).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well, do you wish to be a mathematician, like Theodorus? (19)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (19) Of Cyrene (cf. Plat. "Theaet.") taught Plato. Diog. Laert. ii. 8,

    <p>
      Euth. No, nor yet a mathematician.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then do you wish to be an astronomer? (20) or (as the youth signified
      dissent) possibly a rhapsodist? (21) (he asked), for I am told you have
      the entire works of Homer in your possession. (22)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (20) Cf. below, IV. vii. 4.

 (21) See "Symp." iii. 6; Plat. "Ion."

 (22) See Jowett, "Plato," i. 229; Grote, "Plato," i. 455.
</pre>
    <p>
      Nay, God forbid! not I! (ejaculated the youth). Rhapsodists have a very
      exact acquaintance with epic poetry, I know, of course; but they are
      empty-pated creatures enough themselves. (23)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (23) Or, "are simply perfect in the art of reciting epic poetry, but
    are apt to be the veriest simpletons themselves."
</pre>
    <p>
      At last Socrates said: Can it be, Euthydemus, that you are an aspirant to
      that excellence through which men become statesmen and administrators fit
      to rule and apt to benefit (24) the rest of the world and themselves?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (24)  Or, "statesmen, and economists, and rules, and benefactors of
    the rest of the world and themselves."
</pre>
    <p>
      Yes (replied he), that is the excellence I desire—beyond measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon my word (said Socrates), then you have indeed selected as the object
      of your ambition the noblest of virtues and the greatest of the arts, for
      this is the property of kings, and is entitled "royal"; but (he continued)
      have you considered whether it is possible to excel in these matters
      without being just and upright? (25)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (25) Just, {dikaios} = upright, righteous. Justice, {dikaiosune} =
    social uprightness = righteousness, N.T. To quote a friend: "The
    Greek {dikaios} combines the active dealing out of justice with
    the self-reflective idea of preserving justice in our conduct,
    which is what we mean by 'upright.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      Euth. Certainly I have, and I say that without justice and uprightness it
      is impossible to be a good citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt (replied Socrates) you have accomplished that initial step?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. Well, Socrates, I think I could hold my own against all comers as an
      upright man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And have upright men (continued Socrates) their distinctive and
      appropriate works like those of carpenters or shoe-makers?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. To be sure they have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And just as the carpenter is able to exhibit his works and products,
      the righteous man should be able to expound and set forth his, should he
      not?
    </p>
    <p>
      I see (replied Euthydemus) you are afraid I cannot expound the works of
      righteousness! Why, bless me! of course I can, and the works of
      unrighteousness into the bargain, since there are not a few of that sort
      within reach of eye and ear every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shall we then (proceeded Socrates) write the letter R on this side, (26)
      and on that side the letter W; and then anything that appears to us to be
      the product of righteousness we will place to the R account, and anything
      which appears to be the product of wrong-doing and iniquity to the account
      of W?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (26) The letter R (to stand for Right, Righteous, Upright, Just). The
    letter W (to stand for Wrong, Unrighteous, Unjust).
</pre>
    <p>
      By all means do so (he answered), if you think that it assists matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly Socrates drew the letters, as he had suggested, and continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Lying exists among men, does it not?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. Certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which side of the account then shall we place it? (he asked).
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. Clearly on the side of wrong and injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Deceit too is not uncommon?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. By no means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. To which side shall we place deceit?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. Deceit clearly on the side of wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well, and chicanery (27) or mischief of any sort?

<pre xml:space="preserve"> (27) Reading {to kakourgein} (= furari, Sturz); al. {kleptein}, Stob.

      Soc. And the enslavement of free-born men? (28)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (28) Or, "the kidnapping of men into slavery." {to andrapodizesthai} =
    the reduction of a free-born man to a state of slavery. Slavery

    certain portion of the human race and not in itself immoral.
</pre>
    <p>
      Euth. That too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And we cannot allow any of these to lie on the R side of the account,
      to the side of right and justice, can we, Euthydemus?
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be monstrous (he replied).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Very good. But supposing a man to be elected general, and he succeeds
      in enslaving an unjust, wicked, and hostile state, are we to say that he
      is doing wrong?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. By no means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Shall we not admit that he is doing what is right?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. Certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Again, suppose he deceives the foe while at war with them?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. That would be all fair and right also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Or steals and pillages their property? would he not be doing what is
      right?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. Certainly; when you began I thought you were limiting the question
      to the case of friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. So then everything which we set down on the side of Wrong will now
      have to be placed to the credit of Right?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. Apparently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Very well then, let us so place them; and please, let us make a new
      definition—that while it is right to do such things to a foe, it is
      wrong to do them to a friend, but in dealing with the latter it behoves us
      to be as straightforward as possible. (29)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (29) Or, "an absolutely straightforward course is necessary."
</pre>
    <p>
      I quite assent (replied Euthydemus).
    </p>
    <p>
      So far so good (remarked Socrates); but if a general, seeing his troops
      demoralised, were to invent a tale to the effect that reinforcements were
      coming, and by means of this false statement should revive the courage of
      his men, to which of the two accounts shall we place that act of fraud?

<pre xml:space="preserve"> (30) Cf. "Hell." IV. iii. 10; "Cyrop." I. vi. 31.

    <p>
      On the side of right, to my notion (he replied).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Or again, if a man chanced to have a son ill and in need of medicine,
      which the child refused to take, and supposing the father by an act of
      deceit to administer it under the guise of something nice to eat, and by
      service of that lie to restore the boy to health, to which account shall
      we set down this fraud?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. In my judgment it too should be placed to the same account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well, supposing you have a friend in deplorably low spirits, and you
      are afraid he will make away with himself—accordingly you rob him of
      his knife or other such instrument: to which side ought we to set the
      theft?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. That too must surely be placed to the score of right behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. I understand you to say that a straightforward course is not in every
      case to be pursued even in dealing with friends?
    </p>
    <p>
      Heaven forbid! (the youth exclaimed). If you will allow me, I rescind my
      former statement. (31)

<pre xml:space="preserve"> (31) See above, I. ii. 44 ({anatithemai}).

    <p>
      Soc. Allow you! Of course you may—anything rather than make a false
      entry on our lists.... But there is just another point we ought not to
      leave uninvestigated. Let us take the case of deceiving a friend to his
      detriment: which is the more wrongful—to do so voluntarily or
      unintentionally?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. Really, Socrates, I have ceased to believe in my own answers, for
      all my former admissions and conceptions seem to me other than I first
      supposed them. (32) Still, if I may hazard one more opinion, the
      intentional deceiver, I should say, is worse than the involuntary.

    <p>
      Euth. That is my opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And which should you say was more a man of letters (34)—he who
      intentionally misspells or misreads, or he who does so unconsciously?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (34) Or, "more grammatical"; "the better grammarian."
</pre>
    <p>
      Euth. He who does so intentionally, I should say, because he can spell or
      read correctly whenever he chooses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then the voluntary misspeller may be a lettered person, but the
      involuntary offender is an illiterate? (35)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (35) Or, "In fact, he who sins against the lore of grammer
    intentionally may be a good grammarian and a man of letters, but
    he who does so involuntarily is illiterate and a bad grammarian?"

      Euth. True, he must be. I do not see how to escape from that conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And which of the two knows what is right—he who intentionally
      lies and deceives, or he who lies and deceives unconsciously? (36)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (36) Or, Soc. And does he who lies and deceives with intent know what
    is right rather than he who does either or both unconsciously?

    Euth. Clearly he does.
</pre>
    <p>
      Euth. The intentional and conscious liar clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well then, your statement is this: on the one hand, the man who has
      the knowledge of letters is more lettered than he who has no such
      knowledge? (37)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (37)  Or, Soc. It is a fair inference, is it not, that he who has the
    {episteme} of grammar is more grammatical than he who has no such
    {episteme}?

    Euth. Yes.

    Soc. And he who has the {episteme} of things rightful is more
    righteous than he who lacks the {episteme}? See Plat. "Hipp.
    min."; Arist. "Eth. Eud." VI. v. 7.
</pre>
    <p>
      Euth. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And, on the other, he who has the knowledge of what is right is more
      righteous than he who lacks that knowledge?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. I suppose it is, but for the life of me I cannot make head or tail
      of my own admission. (38)

<pre xml:space="preserve"> (38) Lit. "Apparently; but I appear to myself to be saying this also,
    heaven knows how." See Jowett, "Plato," ii. p. 416 (ed. 2).

      Soc. Well (look at it like this). Suppose a man to be anxious to speak the
      truth, but he is never able to hold the same language about a thing for
      two minutes together. First he says: "The road is towards the east," and
      then he says, "No, it's towards the west"; or, running up a column of
      figures, now he makes the product this, and again he makes it that, now
      more, now less—what do you think of such a man?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. Heaven help us! clearly he does not know what he thought he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And you know the appellation given to certain people—"slavish,"
      (39) or, "little better than a slave?"
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (39) {andropododeis}, which has the connotation of mental dulness, and
    a low order of intellect, cf. "boorish," "rustic," "loutish,"

    moral rather than intellectual deficiency, I suppose. Hence it is
    impossible to preserve the humour of the Socratic argument. See

</pre>
    <p>
      Euth. I do.

    <p>
      Euth. Clearly of their ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Ignorance, for instance, of smithying?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. No, certainly not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then possibly ignorance of carpentering?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. No, nor yet ignorance of carpentering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well, ignorance of shoemaking?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. No, nor ignorance of any of these: rather the reverse, for the
      majority of those who do know just these matters are "little better than
      slaves."
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. You mean it is a title particularly to those who are ignorant of the

      of being slaves?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. Nay, Socrates, by all that is holy, I did flatter myself that at any
      rate I was a student of philosophy, and on the right road to be taught
      everything essential to one who would fain make beauty and goodness his
      pursuit. (41) So that now you may well imagine my despair when, for all my
      pains expended, I cannot even answer the questions put to me about what
      most of all a man should know; and there is no path of progress open to
      me, no avenue of improvement left.

    <p>
      Thereupon Socrates: Tell me, Euthydemus, have you ever been to Delphi?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, certainly; twice (said he).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And did you notice an inscription somewhere on the temple: {GNOMI
      SEAUTON}—KNOW THYSELF?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Did you, possibly, pay no regard to the inscription? or did you give
      it heed and try to discover who and what you were?
    </p>
    <p>
      I can safely say I did not (he answered). That much I made quite sure I
      knew, at any rate; since if I did not know even myself, what in the world
      did I know?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Can a man be said, do you think, to know himself who knows his own
      name and nothing more? or must he not rather set to work precisely like
      the would-be purchaser of a horse, who certainly does not think that he
      has got the knowledge he requires until he has discovered whether the
      beast is tractable or stubborn, strong or weak, quick or slow, and how it
      stands with the other points, serviceable or the reverse, in reference to
      the use and purpose of a horse? So, I say, must a man in like manner
      interrogate his own nature in reference to a man's requirements, and learn
      to know his own capacities, must he not?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. Yes, so it strikes me: he who knows not his own ability knows not
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And this too is plain, is it not: that through self-knowledge men
      meet with countless blessings, and through ignorance of themselves with
      many evils? Because, the man who knows himself knows what is advantageous
      to himself; he discerns the limits of his powers, and by doing what he
      knows, he provides himself with what he needs and so does well; or,
      conversely, by holding aloof from what he knows not, he avoids mistakes
      and thereby mishaps. And having now a test to gauge other human beings he
      uses their need as a stepping-stone to provide himself with good and to
      avoid evil. Whereas he who does not know himself, but is mistaken as to
      his own capacity, is in like predicament to the rest of mankind and all
      human matters else; he neither knows what he wants, nor what he is doing,
      nor the people whom he deals with; and being all abroad in these respects,
      he misses what is good and becomes involved in what is ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, he that knows what he is doing through the success of his
      performance attains to fame and honour; his peers and co-mates are glad to
      make use of him, whilst his less successful neighbours, failing in their
      affairs, are anxious to secure his advice, his guidance, his protection;
      (42) they place their hopes of happiness in him, and for all these causes
      (43) single him out as the chief object of their affection. He, on the
      contrary, who knows not what he does, who chooses amiss and fails in what
      he puts his hands to, not only incurs loss and suffers chastisement
      through his blunders, but step by step loses reputation and becomes a
      laughing-stock, and in the end is doomed to a life of dishonour and
      contempt.

<pre xml:space="preserve"> (44) Or, more lit. "A law which applies, you will observe, to bodies

</pre>
    <p>
      Thereupon Euthydemus: Be assured I fully concur in your opinion; the
      precept KNOW THYSELF cannot be too highly valued; but what is the
      application? What the starting-point of self-examination? I look to you
      for an explanation, if you would kindly give one. (45)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (45) Or, "at what point to commence the process of self-inspection?—
    there is the mystery. I look to you, if you are willing, to
    interpret it."
</pre>
    <p>
      Well (replied Socrates), I presume you know quite well the distinction
      between good and bad things: your knowledge may be relied upon so far?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, yes, to be sure (replied the youth); for without that much
      discernment I should indeed be worse than any slave. (46)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (46) Lit. "if I did not know even that."
</pre>
    <p>
      Come then (said he), do you give me an explanation of the things so
      termed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is fortunately not hard (replied the youth). First of all, health in
      itself I hold to be a good, and disease in itself an evil; and in the next
      place the sources of either of those aforenamed, meats and drinks, and
      habits of life, (47) I regard as good or evil according as they contribute
      either to health or to disease.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (47) Or, "pursuits and occupations"; "manners and customs."
</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. Then health and disease themselves when they prove to be sources of
      any good are good, but when of any evil, evil?
    </p>
    <p>
      And when (asked he), can health be a source of evil, or disease a source
      of good?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, bless me! often enough (replied Socrates). In the event, for
      instance, of some ill-starred expedition or of some disastrous voyage or
      other incident of the sort, of which veritably there are enough to spare—when
      those who owing to their health and strength take a part in the affair are
      lost; whilst those who were left behind—as hors de combat, on
      account of ill-health of other feebleness—are saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. Yes, you are right; but you will admit that there are advantages to
      be got from strength and lost through weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Even so; but ought we to regard those things which at one moment
      benefit and at another moment injure us in any strict sense good rather
      than evil?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. No, certainly not, according to that line of argument. But wisdom,
      (48) Socrates, you must on your side admit, is irrefragably a good; since
      there is nothing which or in which a wise man would not do better than a
      fool.

<pre xml:space="preserve"> (48) See above, III. ix. 5. Here {sophia} is not = {sophrosune}.

      seized by Minos on account of his wisdom, and forced to be his slave, and
      robbed of fatherland and freedom at one swoop? and how, while endeavouring
      to make his escape with his son, he caused the boy's death without

      happiness be without these?

      of mischief which befall mankind. How many are ruined by their fair faces
      at the hand of admirers driven to distraction (54) by the sight of beauty
      in its bloom! how many, tempted by their strength to essay deeds beyond
      their power, are involved in no small evils! how many, rendered effeminate
      by reason of their wealth, have been plotted against and destroyed! (55)

</pre>
    <p>
      Nay, these are matters (proceeded Socrates) which perhaps, through
      excessive confidence in your knowledge of them, you have failed to examine
      into; but since the state, which you are preparing yourself to direct, is
      democratically constituted, (57) of course you know what a democracy is.

    </p>

      necessaries, (58) and by rich those who have more means than sufficient
      for all their needs.

<pre xml:space="preserve"> (58) Al. "who cannot contribute their necessary quota to the taxes

      this sufficient, but actually succeed in getting a surplus out of it;
      while others do not find a large fortune large enough?
    </p>
    <p>
      I have, most certainly; and I thank you for the reminder (replied
      Euthydemus). One has heard of crowned heads and despotic rulers being
      driven by want to commit misdeeds like the veriest paupers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, if that is how matters stand (continued Socrates), we must class
      these same crowned heads with the commonalty; and some possessors of scant
      fortunes, provided they are good economists, with the wealthy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Euthydemus: It is the poverty of my own wit which forces me to this
      admission. I bethink me it is high time to keep silence altogether; a
      little more, and I shall be proved to know absolutely nothing. And so he
      went away crestfallen, in an agony of self-contempt, persuaded that he was
      verily and indeed no better than a slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst those who were reduced to a like condition by Socrates, many
      refused to come near him again, whom he for his part looked upon as dolts
      and dullards. (59) But Euthydemus had the wit to understand that, in order
      to become worthy of account, his best plan was to associate as much as
      possible with Socrates; and from that moment, save for some necessity, he
      never left him—in some points even imitating him in his habits and
      pursuits. Socrates, on his side, seeing that this was the young man's
      disposition, disturbed him as little as possible, but in the simplest and
      plainest manner initiated him into everything which he held to be needful
      to know or important to practise.

      It may be inferred that Socrates was in no hurry for those who were with
      him to discover capacities for speech and action or as inventive geniuses,
      (1) without at any rate a well-laid foundation of self-control. (2) For
      those who possessed such abilities without these same saving virtues
      would, he believed, only become worse men with greater power for mischief.
      His first object was to instil into those who were with him a wise spirit
      in their relation to the gods. (3) That such was the tenor of his
      conversation in dealing with men may be seen from the narratives of others
      who were present on some particular occasion. (4) I confine myself to a
      particular discussion with Euthydemus at which I was present.

      heavenly powers yield us? Out of earth's bosom they cause good to spring
      up (8) for our benefit; and for our benefit provide appropriate seasons to
      furnish us in turn not only with the many and diverse objects of need, but
      with the sources also of our joy and gladness? (9)

      conspires with earth and the seasons to give both birth and increase to
      all things useful to us; nay, which helps to nurture our very selves, and
      commingling with all that feeds us, renders it more digestible, more
      wholesome, and more pleasant to the taste; and mark you in proportion to
      the abundance of our need the superabundance of its supply. What say you
      concerning such a boon?

      Euth. In this again I see a sign of providential care.

      Soc. And then the fact that the same heavenly power has provided us with
      fire (11)—our assistant against cold, our auxiliary in darkness, our
      fellow-workman in every art and every instrument which for the sake of its
      utility mortal man may invent or furnish himself withal. What of this,
      since, to put it compendiously, there is nothing serviceable to the life
      of man worth speaking of but owes its fabrication to fire? (12)

      Soc. Again, consider the motions of the Sun, (14) how when he has turned
      him about in winter (15) he again draws nigh to us, ripening some fruits,
      and causing others whose time is past to dry up; how when he has fulfilled
      his work he comes no closer, but turns away as if in fear to scorch us to
      our hurt unduly; and again, when he has reached a point where if he should
      prolong his retreat we should plainly be frozen to death with cold, note
      how he turns him about and resumes his approach, traversing that region of
      the heavens where he may shed his genial influence best upon us.

      scorching heat or freezing cold if they came suddenly upon us, note how
      gradually the sun approaches, and how gradually recedes, so that we fail
      to notice how we come at last to either extreme. (16)

    <p>
      For my part (he replied), the question forces itself upon my mind, whether
      the gods have any other occupation save only to minister to man; and I am
      only hindered from saying so, because the rest of animals would seem to
      share these benefits along with man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Why, to be sure; and is it not plain that these animals themselves
      are born and bred for the sake of man? At any rate, no living creature
      save man derives so many of his enjoyments from sheep and goats, horses
      and cattle and asses, and other animals. He is more dependent, I should
      suppose, on these than even on plants and vegetables. At any rate, equally
      with these latter they serve him as means of subsistence or articles of
      commerce; indeed, a large portion of the human family do not use the
      products of the soil as food at all, but live on the milk and cheese and
      flesh of their flocks and herds, whilst all men everywhere tame and
      domesticate the more useful kinds of animals, and turn them to account as
      fellow-workers in war and for other purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I cannot but agree with what you say (he answered), when I see that
      animals so much stronger than man become so subservient to his hand that
      he can use them as he lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And as we reflect on the infinite beauty and utility and the variety
      of nature, what are we to say of the fact that man has been endowed with
      sensibilities which correspond with this diversity, whereby we take our
      fill of every blessing; (17) or, again, this implanted faculty of
      reasoning, which enables us to draw inferences concerning the things which
      we perceive, and by aid of memory to understand how each set of things may
      be turned to our good, and to devise countless contrivances with a view to
      enjoying the good and repelling the evil; or lastly, when we consider the
      faculty bestowed upon us of interpretative speech, by which we are enabled
      to instruct one another, and to participate in all the blessings
      fore-named: to form societies, to establish laws, and to enter upon a
      civilised existence (18)—what are we to think?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (17) Or, "Again, when we consider how many beautiful objects there are
    serviceable to man, and yet how unlike they are to one another,

    <p>
      Euth. Yes, Socrates, decidedly it would appear that the gods do manifest a
      great regard, nay, a tender care, towards mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well, and what do you make of the fact that where we are powerless to
      take advantageous forethought for our future, at this stage they
      themselves lend us their co-operation, imparting to the inquirer through
      divination knowledge of events about to happen, and instructing him by
      what means they may best be turned to good account?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. Ay, and you, Socrates, they would seem to treat in a more friendly
      manner still than the rest of men, if, without waiting even to be inquired
      of by you, they show you by signs beforehand what you must, and what you
      must not do. (19)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (19) See above, I. iv. 14, for a parallel to the train of thought on
    the part of Aristodemus "the little," and of Euthydemus; and for
    Socrates' {daimonion}, see above; Grote, "Plato," i. 400.
</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. Yes, and you will discover for yourself the truth of what I say, if,
      without waiting to behold the outward and visible forms (20) of the gods
      themselves, you will be content to behold their works; and with these
      before you, to worship and honour the Divine authors of them. (21) I would
      have you reflect that the very gods themselves suggest this teaching. (22)
      Not one of these but gives us freely of his blessings; yet they do not
      step from behind their veil in order to grant one single boon. (23) And
      pre-eminently He who orders and holds together the universe, (24) in which
      are all things beautiful and good; (25) who fashions and refashions it to
      never-ending use unworn, keeping it free from sickness or decay, (26) so
      that swifter than thought it ministers to his will unerringly—this
      God is seen to perform the mightiest operations, but in the actual
      administration of the same abides himself invisible to mortal ken. Reflect
      further, this Sun above our heads, so visible to all—as we suppose—will
      not suffer man to regard him too narrowly, but should any essay to watch
      him with a shameless stare he will snatch away their power of vision. And
      if the gods themselves are thus unseen, so too shall you find their
      ministers to be hidden also; from the height of heaven above the
      thunderbolt is plainly hurled, and triumphs over all that it encounters,
      yet it is all-invisible, no eye may detect its coming or its going at the
      moment of its swoop. The winds also are themselves unseen, though their
      works are manifest, and through their approach we are aware of them. And
      let us not forget, the soul of man himself, which if aught else human
      shares in the divine—however manifestly enthroned within our bosom,
      is as wholly as the rest hidden from our gaze. These things you should lay
      to mind, and not despise the invisible ones, but learn to recognise their
      power, as revealed in outward things, and to know the divine influence.

      Nay, Socrates (replied Euthydemus), there is no danger I shall turn a deaf
      ear to the divine influence even a little; of that I am not afraid, but I
      am out of heart to think that no soul of man may ever requite the kindness
      of the gods with fitting gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be not out of heart because of that (he said); you know what answer the
      god at Delphi makes to each one who comes asking "how shall I return
      thanks to heaven?"—"According to the law and custom of your city";
      and this, I presume, is law and custom everywhere that a man should please
      the gods with offerings according to the ability which is in him. (28) How
      then should a man honour the gods with more beautiful or holier honour
      than by doing what they bid him? but he must in no wise slacken or fall
      short of his ability, for when a man so does, it is manifest, I presume,
      that at the moment he is not honouring the gods. You must then honour the
      gods, not with shortcoming but according to your ability; and having so
      done, be of good cheer and hope to receive the greatest blessings. For
      where else should a man of sober sense look to receive great blessings if
      not from those who are able to help him most, and how else should he hope
      to obtain them save by seeking to please his helper, and how may he hope
      to please his helper better than by yielding him the amplest obedience?

      But indeed (1) with respect to justice and uprightness he not only made no
      secret of the opinion he held, but gave practical demonstration of it,
      both in private by his law-abiding and helpful behaviour to all, (2) and
      in public by obeying the magistrates in all that the laws enjoined,
      whether in the life of the city or in military service, so that he was a
      pattern of loyalty to the rest of the world, and on three several
      occasions in particular: first, when as president (Epistates) of the
      assembly he would not suffer the sovereign people to take an
      unconstitutional vote, (3) but ventured, on the side of the laws, to
      resist a current of popular feeling strong enough, I think, to have
      daunted any other man. Again, when the Thirty tried to lay some injunction
      on him contrary to the laws, he refused to obey, as for instance when they
      forbade his conversing with the young; (4) or again, when they ordered him
      and certain other citizens to arrest a man to be put to death, (5) he
      stood out single-handed on the ground that the injunctions laid upon him
      were contrary to the laws. And lastly, when he appeared as defendant in
      the suit instituted by Meletus, (6) notwithstanding that it was customary
      for litigants in the law courts to humour the judges in the conduct of
      their arguments by flattery and supplications contrary to the laws, (7)
      notwithstanding also that defendants owed their acquittal by the court to
      the employment of such methods, he refused to do a single thing however
      habitual in a court of law which was not strictly legal; and though by
      only a slight deflection from the strict path he might easily have been
      acquitted by his judges, (8) he preferred to abide by the laws and die
      rather than transgress them and live.

      or coppersmith or horseman, he would have no doubt where to send him for
      the purpose: "People say," (11) he added, "that if a man wants to get his
      horse or his ox taught in the right way, (12) the world is full of

      of your ridiculing all the rest of the world, questioning and

      not what the just man does, but what he does not do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, I thought for my part (answered Socrates) that the refusal to do
      wrong and injustice was a sufficient warrent in itself of righteousness
      and justice, but if you do not agree, see if this pleases you better: I
      assert that what is "lawful" is "just and righteous."

      Then I presume (Socrates continued) that a member of a state who regulates
      his life in accordance with these enactments will be law-abiding, while
      the transgressor of the same will be law-less?
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And I presume that he who does what is just is just, and he who does
      what is unjust is unjust?

      serious matter either the laws themselves, or obedience to them, which
      laws the very people who made them are perpetually rejecting and altering?
    </p>
    <p>
      Which is also true of war (Socrates replied); cities are perpetually
      undertaking war and then making peace again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most true (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. If so, what is the difference between depreciating obedience to law
      because laws will be repealed, and depreciating good discipline in war
      because peace will one day be made? But perhaps you object to enthusiasm
      displayed in defence of one's home and fatherland in war?
    </p>
    <p>
      No, indeed I do not! I heartily approve of it (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then have you laid to heart the lesson taught by Lycurgus to the
      Lacedaemonians, (24) and do you understand that if he succeeded in giving
      Sparta a distinction above other states, it was only by instilling into
      her, beyond all else, a spirit of obedience to the laws? And among
      magistrates and rulers in the different states, you would scarcely refuse
      the palm of superiority to those who best contribute to make their
      fellow-citizens obedient to the laws? And you would admit that any
      particular state in which obedience to the laws is the paramount
      distinction of the citizens flourishes most in peace time, and in time of
      war is irresistible? But, indeed, of all the blessings which a state may
      enjoy, none stands higher than the blessing of unanimity. "Concord among
      citizens"—that is the constant theme of exhortation emphasised by
      the councils of elders (25) and by the choice spirits of the community;
      (26) at all times and everywhere through the length and breadth of all
      Hellas it is an established law that the citizens be bound together by an
      oath of concord; (27) everywhere they do actually swear this oath; not of
      course as implying that citizens shall all vote for the same choruses, or
      give their plaudits to the same flute-players, or choose the same poets,
      or limit themselves to the same pleasures, but simply that they shall pay
      obedience to the laws, since in the end that state will prove most
      powerful and most prosperous in which the citizens abide by these; but
      without concord neither can a state be well administered nor a household
      well organised.

    <p>
      And if we turn to private life, what better protection can a man have than
      obedience to the laws? This shall be his safeguard against penalties, his
      guarantee of honours at the hands of the community; it shall be a clue to
      thread his way through the mazes of the law courts unbewildered, secure
      against defeat, assured of victory. (28) It is to him, the law-loving
      citizen, that men will turn in confidence when seeking a guardian of the
      most sacred deposits, be it of money or be it their sons or daughters. He,
      in the eyes of the state collectively, is trustworthy—he and no
      other; who alone may be depended on to render to all alike their dues—to
      parents and kinsmen and servants, to friends and fellow-citizens and
      foreigners. This is he whom the enemy will soonest trust to arrange an
      armistice, or a truce, or a treaty of peace. They would like to become the
      allies of this man, and to fight on his side. This is he to whom the
      allies (29) of his country will most confidently entrust the command of
      their forces, or of a garrison, or their states themselves. This, again,
      is he who may be counted on to recompense kindness with gratitude, and
      who, therefore, is more sure of kindly treatment than another whose sense
      of gratitude is fuller. (30) The most desirable among friends, the enemy
      of all others to be avoided, clearly he is not the person whom a foreign
      state would choose to go to war with; encompassed by a host of friends and
      exempt from foes, his very character has a charm to compel friendship and
      alliance, and before him hatred and hostility melt away.

    <p>
      And now, Hippias, I have done my part; that is my proof and demonstration
      that the "lawful" and "law-observant" are synonymous with the "upright"
      and the "just"; do you, if you hold a contrary view, instruct us. (31)

      Then Hippias: Nay, upon my soul, Socrates, I am not aware of holding any
      contrary opinion to what you have uttered on the theme of justice. (32)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (32) Lit. "the just and upright," {tou dikaiou}.

<pre xml:space="preserve"> (33) See Soph. "Antig." "Oed. T." 865, and Prof. Jebb ad loc.; Dem.

    <p>
      Yes (he answered), those held in every part of the world, and in the same
      sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can you then assert (asked Socrates) of these unwritten laws that men made
      them?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay, how (he answered) should that be, for how could they all have come
      together from the ends of the earth? and even if they had so done, men are
      not all of one speech? (34)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (34) Or, "there would be difficulty of understanding each other, and a
    babel of tongues."
</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. Whom then do you believe to have been the makers of these laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hipp. For my part, I think that the gods must have made these laws for
      men, and I take it as proof that first and foremost it is a law and custom
      everywhere to worship and reverence the gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And, I presume, to honour parents is also customary everywhere?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that too (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And, I presume, also the prohibition of intermarriage between parents
      and children?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hipp. No; at that point I stop, Socrates. That does not seem to me to be a
      law of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, why? (he asked).
    </p>
    <p>
      Because I perceive it is not infrequently transgressed (he answered). (35)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (35) Or, "as I perceive, it is not of universal application, some
    transgress it."
</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. Well, but there are a good many other things which people do contrary
      to law; only the penalty, I take it, affixed to the transgression of the
      divine code is certain; there is no escape for the offender after the
      manner in which a man may transgress the laws of man with impunity,
      slipping through the fingers of justice by stealth, or avoiding it by
      violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hipp. And what is the inevitable penalty paid by those who, being related
      as parents and children, intermingle in marriage?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. The greatest of all penalties; for what worse calamity can human
      beings suffer in the production of offspring than to misbeget? (36)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (36) Or, "in the propagation of the species than to produce
    misbegotten children."
</pre>
    <p>
      Hipp. But how or why should they breed them ill where nothing hinders
      them, being of a good stock themselves and producing from stock as good?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Because, forsooth, in order to produce good children, it is not
      simply necessary that the parents should be good and of a good stock, but
      that both should be equally in the prime and vigour of their bodies. (37)
      Do you suppose that the seed of those who are at their prime is like
      theirs who either have not yet reached their prime, or whose prime has
      passed?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (37) Cf. Plat. "Laws," viii. 839 A; Herbst, etc., cf. Grotius, "de
    Jure," ii. 5, xii. 4.
</pre>
    <p>
      Hipp. No, it is reasonable to expect that the seed will differ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And for the better—which?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hipp. Theirs clearly who are at their prime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. It would seem that the seed of those who are not yet in their prime
      or have passed their prime is not good?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hipp. It seems most improbable it should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then the right way to produce children is not that way?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hipp. No, that is not the right way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then children who are so produced are produced not as they ought to
      be?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hipp. So it appears to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      What offspring then (he asked) will be ill produced, ill begotten, and ill
      born, if not these?
    </p>
    <p>
      I subscribe to that opinion also (replied Hippias).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well, it is a custom universally respected, is it not, to return good
      for good, and kindness with kindness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hipp. Yes, a custom, but one which again is apt to be transgressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then he that so transgresses it pays penalty in finding himself
      isolated; bereft of friends who are good, and driven to seek after those
      who love him not. Or is it not so that he who does me kindness in my
      intercourse with him is my good friend, but if I requite not this kindness
      to my benefactor, I am hated by him for my ingratitude, and yet I must
      needs pursue after him and cling to him because of the great gain to me of
      his society?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hipp. Yes, Socrates. In all these cases, I admit, there is an implication
      of divine authority; (38) that a law should in itself be loaded with the
      penalty of its transgression does suggest to my mind a higher than human
      type of legislator.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (38) Lit. "Yes, upon my word, Socrates, all these cases look very like
    (would seem to point to) the gods."
</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. And in your opinion, Hippias, is the legislation of the gods just and
      righteous, or the reverse of what is just and righteous?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hipp. Not the reverse of what is just and righteous, Socrates, God forbid!
      for scarcely could any other legislate aright, of not God himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. It would seem then, Hippias, the gods themselves are well pleased
      that "the lawful" and "the just" should be synonymous? (39)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (39) Or, "it is well pleasing also to the gods that what is lawful is
    just and what is just is lawful."
</pre>
    <p>
      By such language and by such conduct, through example and precept alike,
      he helped to make those who approached him more upright and more just.
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      And now I propose to show in what way he made those who were with him more
      vigorous in action. (1) In the first place, as befitted one whose creed
      was that a basis of self-command is indispensable to any noble
      performance, he manifested himself to his companions as one who had
      pre-eminently disciplined himself; (2) and in the next place by
      conversation and discussion he encouraged them to a like self-restraint
      beyond all others. (3) Thus it was that he continued ever mindful himself,
      and was continually reminding all whom he encountered, of matters
      conducive to virtue; as the following discussion with Euthydemus, which
      has come to my knowledge, (4) will serve to illustrate—the topic of
      the discussion being self-command.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (1) Lit. "more practical," i.e. more energetic and effective.

 (2) "If any one might claim to be a prince of ascetics, it was
    Socrates; such was the ineffaceable impression left on the minds
    of his associates."

 (3) Or, "he stimulated in these same companions a spirit of self-
    restraint beyond all else."

 (4) Or, "which I can vouch for."
</pre>
    <p>
      Tell me, Euthydemus (he began), do you believe freedom to be a noble and
      magnificent acquisition, whether for a man or for a state?
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot conceive a nobler or more magnificent (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then do you believe him to be a free man who is ruled by the
      pleasures of the body, and thereby cannot perform what is best?
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly not (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. No! for possibly to perform what is best appears to you to savour of
      freedom? And, again, to have some one over you who will prevent you doing
      the like seems a loss of freedom?
    </p>
    <p>
      Most decidedly (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. It would seem you are decidedly of opinion that the incontinent are
      the reverse of free? (5)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (5) Or, "incontinency is illiberal."
</pre>
    <p>
      Euth. Upon my word, I much suspect so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And does it appear to you that the incontinent man is merely hindered
      from doing what is noblest, or that further he is impelled to do what is
      most shameful?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. I think he is as much driven to the one as he is hindered from the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And what sort of lords and masters are those, think you, who at once
      put a stop to what is best and enforce what is worst?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. Goodness knows, they must be the very worst of masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And what sort of slavery do you take to be the worst?
    </p>
    <p>
      I should say (he answered) slavery to the worst masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would seem then (pursued Socrates) that the incontinent man is bound
      over to the worst sort of slavery, would it not?
    </p>
    <p>
      So it appears to be (the other answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And does it not appear to you that this same beldame incontinence
      shuts out wisdom, which is the best of all things, (6) from mankind, and
      plunges them into the opposite? Does it not appear to you that she hinders
      men from attending to things which will be of use and benefit, and from
      learning to understand them; that she does so by dragging them away to
      things which are pleasant; and often though they are well aware of the
      good and of the evil, she amazes and confounds (7) their wits and makes
      them choose the worse in place of the better?

    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And (8) soundness of soul, the spirit of temperate modesty? Who has
      less claim to this than the incontinent man? The works of the temperate
      spirit and the works of incontinency are, I take it, diametrically
      opposed?

<pre xml:space="preserve"> (8) "And if this be so concerning wisdom, {sophia}, what of

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. If this then be so concerning these virtues, (9) what with regard to
      carefulness and devotion to all that ought to occupy us? Can anything more
      seriously militate against these than this same incontinence?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (9) Or add, "If this be so concerning not wisdom only, but concerning
    temperance and soundness of soul, what," etc.
</pre>
    <p>
      Nothing that I can think of (he replied).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And can worse befall a man, think you? Can he be subjected to a more
      baleful influence than that which induces him to choose what is hurtful in
      place of what is helpful; which cajoles him to devote himself to the evil
      and to neglect the good; which forces him, will he nill he, to do what
      every man in his sober senses would shrink from and avoid?
    </p>
    <p>
      I can imagine nothing worse (he replied).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Self-control, it is reasonable to suppose, will be the cause of
      opposite effects upon mankind to those of its own opposite, the want of
      self-control?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. It is to be supposed so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And this, which is the source of opposite effects to the very worst,
      will be the very best of things?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. That is the natural inference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. It looks, does it not, Euthydemus, as if self-control were the best
      thing a man could have?
    </p>
    <p>
      It does indeed, Socrates (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. But now, Euthydemus, has it ever occurred to you to note one fact?
    </p>
    <p>
      What fact? (he asked).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. That, after all, incontinency is powerless to bring us to that realm
      of sweetness which some look upon (10) as her peculiar province; it is not
      incontinency but self-control alone which has the passport to highest
      pleasures.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (10) Or, "which we are apt to think of as."
</pre>
    <p>
      In what way? (he asked). How so?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, this way (Socrates answered): since incontinency will not suffer us
      to resist hunger and thirst, or to hold out against sexual appetite, or
      want of sleep (which abstinences are the only channels to true pleasure in
      eating and drinking, to the joys of love, to sweet repose and blissful
      slumber won by those who will patiently abide and endure till each
      particular happiness is at the flood) (11)—it comes to this: by
      incontinency we are cut off from the full fruition of the more obvious and
      constantly recurring pleasures. (12) To self-control, which alone enables
      us to endure the pains aforesaid, alone belongs the power to give us any
      pleasure worth remembering in these common cases.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (11) Or, "at its season." Lit. "is as sweet as possible."

 (12) Or, "from tasting to any extent worth speaking of the most
    necessary and all-pervading sources of happiness."
</pre>
    <p>
      You speak the words of truth (13) (he answered).
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (13) Lit. "What you say is absolutely and entirely true" (the "vraie
    verite" of the matter).
</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. Furthermore, (14) if there be any joy in learning aught "beautiful
      and good," or in patient application to such rules as may enable a man to
      manage his body aright, or to administer his household well, or to prove
      himself useful to his friends and to the state, or to dominate his enemies—which
      things are the sources not only of advantage but of deepest satisfaction
      (15)—to the continent and self-controlled it is given to reap the
      fruits of them in their performance. It is the incontinent who have
      neither part nor lot in any one of them. Since we must be right in
      asserting that he is least concerned with such things who has least
      ability to do them, being tied down to take an interest in the pleasure
      which is nearest to hand.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (14) Or, "But indeed, if there be joy in the pursuit of any noble
    study or of such accomplishments as shall enable," etc.

 (15) Or, "of the highest pleasures."
</pre>
    <p>
      Euthydemus replied: Socrates, you would say, it seems to me, that a man
      who is mastered by the pleasures of the body has no concern at all with
      virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what is the distinction, Euthydemus (he asked), between a man devoid
      of self-control and the dullest of brute beasts? A man who foregoes all
      height of aim, who gives up searching for the best and strives only to
      gratify his sense of pleasure, (16) is he better than the silliest of
      cattle? (17)... But to the self-controlled alone is it given to discover
      the hid treasures. These, by word and by deed, they will pick out and make
      selection of them according to their kinds, choosing deliberately the good
      and holding aloof from the evil. (18) Thus (he added) it is that a man
      reaches the zenith, as it were, of goodness and happiness, thus it is that
      he becomes most capable of reasoning and discussion. (19) The very name
      discussion ({dialegesthai}) is got from people coming together and
      deliberating in common by picking out and selecting things ({dialegein})
      according to their kinds. (20) A man then is bound to prepare himself as
      much as possible for this business, and to pursue it beyond all else with
      earnest resolution; for this is the right road to excellence, this will
      make a man fittest to lead his fellows and be a master in debate. (21)

      At this point I will endeavour to explain in what way Socrates fostered
      this greater "dialectic" capacity among his intimates. (1) He held firmly
      to the opinion that if a man knew what each reality was, he would be able
      to explain this knowledge to others; but, failing the possession of that
      knowledge, it did not surprise him that men should stumble themselves and
      cause others to stumble also. (2) It was for this reason that he never
      ceased inquiring with those who were with him into the true nature of
      things that are. (3) It would be a long business certainly to go through
      in detail all the definitions at which he arrived; I will therefore
      content myself with such examples as will serve to show his method of
      procedure. As a first instance I will take the question of piety. The mode
      of investigation may be fairly represented as follows.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (1) Lit. "essayed to make those who were with him more potent in
    dialectic."

 (2) Or, "Socrates believed that any one who knew the nature of
    anything would be able to let others into his secret; but, failing
    that knowledge, he thought the best of men would be but blind
    leaders of the blind, stumbling themselves and causing others to
    stumble also."

 (3) Or add, "'What is this among things? and what is its definition?'
    —such was the ever-recurrent question for which he sought an
    answer."
</pre>
    <p>
      Tell me (said he), Euthydemus, what sort of thing you take piety to be?
    </p>
    <p>
      Something most fair and excellent, no doubt (the other answered). (4)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (4) Or, "A supreme excellence, no doubt."
</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. And can you tell me what sort of person the pious man is? (5)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (5) Or, "can you give me a definition of the pious man?"; "tell me who
    and what the pious man is."
</pre>
    <p>
      I should say (he answered) he is a man who honours the gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And is it allowable to honour the gods in any mode or fashion one
      likes?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. No; there are laws in accordance with which one must do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Then he who knows these laws will know how he must honour the gods?
    </p>
    <p>
      I think so (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And he who knows how he must honour the gods conceives that he ought
      not to do so except in the manner which accords with his knowledge? (6) Is
      it not so?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (6) i.e. "his practice must square with his knowledge and be the
    outward expression of his belief?"
</pre>
    <p>
      Euth. That is so. (7)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (7) "That is so; you rightly describe his frame of mind and
    persuasion."
</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. And does any man honour the gods otherwise than he thinks he ought?
      (8)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (8) "As he should and must." See K. Joel, op. cit. p. 322 foll.
</pre>
    <p>
      I think not (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. It comes to this then: he who knows what the law requires in
      reference to the gods will honour the gods in the lawful way? (9)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (9) Or, "he who knows what is lawful with regard to Heaven pays honour
    to Heaven lawfully."
</pre>
    <p>
      Euth. Certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. But now, he who honours lawfully honours as he ought? (10)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (10) "As he should and must."
</pre>
    <p>
      Euth. I see no alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And he who honours as he ought is a pious man?
    </p>
    <p>
      Euth. Certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. It would appear that he who knows what the law requires with respect
      to the gods will correctly be defined as a pious man, and that is our
      definition?
    </p>
    <p>
      So it appears to me, at any rate (he replied). (11)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (11) "I accept it at any rate as mine." N.B.—in reference to this
    definition of Piety, the question is never raised {poion ti esti
    nomos}; nor yet {poioi tines eisin oi theoi}; but clearly there is
    a growth in {ta nomima}. Cf. the conversation recorded in St. John
    iv. 7 foll., and the words (verse 23) {pneuma o Theos kai tous
    proskunountas auton en pneumati kai aletheia dei proskunein},
    which the philosopher Socrates would perhaps readily have assented
    to.
</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. But now, with regard to human beings; is it allowable to deal with
      men in any way one pleases? (12)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (12) Or, "may a man deal with his fellow-men arbitrarily according to
    his fancy?" See above, II. vii. 8.
</pre>
    <p>
      Euth. No; with regard to men also, he will be a law-observing man (13) who
      knows what things are lawful as concerning men, in accordance with which
      our dealings with one another must be conducted. (14)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (13) Or, "he is a man full of the law (lawful) and law-abiding who
    knows," etc.

 (14) Reading {kath' a dei pros allelous khresthai}, subaud.
    {allelois}, or if vulg. {kath' a dei pos allelois khresthai},
    translate "must be specifically conducted."
</pre>
    <p>
      Soc. Then those who deal with one another in this way, deal with each
      other as they ought? (15)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (15) "As they should and must."
</pre>
    <p>
      Obviously (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And they who deal with one another as they ought, deal well and nobly—is
      it not so?
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And they who deal well and nobly by mankind are well-doers in respect
      of human affairs?
    </p>
    <p>
      That would seem to follow (he replied).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. I presume that those who obey the laws do what is just and right?
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a doubt, (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And by things right and just you know what sort of things are meant?
    </p>
    <p>
      What the laws ordain (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. It would seem to follow that they who do what the laws ordain both do
      what is right and just and what they ought? (16)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (16) "What they should and must."
</pre>
    <p>
      Euth. I see no alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. But then, he who does what is just and right is upright and just?
      (17)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (17) This proposition, as Kuhner argues (ad loc.), is important as
    being the middle term of the double syllogism (A and B)—

    A.  Those who do what the law demands concerning men do what is
        just and right.

        Those who do what is just and right are righteous and just.

        Ergo—Those who do what the law demands concerning men are
        righteous and just.

    B.  Those who know what is just and right ought (and are bound,
        cf. above, III. ix. 4) to do also what is just and right.

        Those who do what is just and right are righteous and just.

        Ergo—Righteous and Just ({dikaioi}) may be defined as "Those
        who know what the law demands (aliter things right and just)
        concerning men."
</pre>
    <p>
      I should say so myself (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And should you say that any one obeys the laws without knowing what
      the laws ordain?
    </p>
    <p>
      I should not (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And do you suppose that any one who knows what things he ought to do
      supposes that he ought not to do them? (18)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (18) Or, "and no one who knows what he must and should do imagines
    that he must and should not do it?"
</pre>
    <p>
      No, I suppose not (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And do you know of anybody doing other than what he feels bound to
      do? (19)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (19) Or, "and nobody that you know of does the contrary of what he
    thinks he should do?"
</pre>
    <p>
      No, I do not (he answered).

    <p>
      Soc. It would seem that he who knows what things are lawful (20) as
      concerning men does the things that are just and right?
    </p>

</pre>

      Who else, if not? (he replied).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. It would seem, then, we shall have got to a right definition if we
      name as just and upright those who know the things which are lawful as
      concerning men?
    </p>
    <p>
      That is my opinion (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And what shall we say that wisdom is? Tell me, does it seem to you
      that the wise are wise in what they know, (22) or are there any who are
      wise in what they know not?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (22) Or, "in that of which they have the knowledge ({episteme})."

      have wisdom in that which he does not know?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (23) Or, "their wisdom is confined to that of which they have the
    {episteme}. How could a man be wise in what he lacks the knowledge

      you?

    <p>
      Euth. No; that, and that only, I think.

      Euth. No, indeed! not the hundredth part of them, I should say.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Quite impossible (he answered).

      Soc. It would seem the wisdom of each is limited to his knowledge; each is

      That is how it appears to me (he answered).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And the beautiful: can we speak of a thing as beautiful in any other

      A kingdom and a tyranny (37) were, he opined, both of them forms of

      kingdom was a government over willing men in accordance with civil law,
      whereas a tyranny implied the government over unwilling subjects not
      according to law, but so as to suit the whims and wishes of the ruler.

      There were, moreover, three forms of citizenship or polity; in the case
      where the magistrates were appointed from those who discharged the
      obligations prescribed by law, he held the polity to be an aristocracy (or
      rule of the best); (38) where the title to office depended on rateable
      property, it was a plutocracy (or rule of wealth); and lastly, where all
      the citizens without distinction held the reins of office, that was a
      democracy (or rule of the people).

      Let me explain his method of reply where the disputant had no clear
      statement to make, but without attempt at proof chose to contend that such
      or such a person named by himself was wiser, or more of a statesman, or
      more courageous, and so forth, than some other person. (39) Socrates had a

      (40) as thus:

<pre xml:space="preserve"> (39) Or, "if any one encountered him in argument about any topic or
    person without any clear statement, but a mere ipse dixit, devoid
    of demonstration, that so and so," etc.

      Soc. You state that so and so, whom you admire, is a better citizen that
      this other whom I admire?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Disputant. Yes; I repeat the assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. But would it not have been better to inquire first what is the work
      or function of a good citizen?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Disputant. Let us do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. To begin, then, with the matter of expenditure: his superiority will
      be shown by his increasing the resources and lightening the expenditure of
      the state? (41)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (41) Or, "In the management of moneys, then, his strength will consist
    in his rendering the state better provided with ways and means?"
</pre>
    <p>
      Certainly (the disputant would answer).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. And in the event of war, by rendering his state superior to her
      antagonists?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Disputant. Clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Or on an embassy as a diplomatist, I presume, by securing friends in
      place of enemies?
    </p>
    <p>
      That I should imagine (replies the disputant).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soc. Well, and in parliamentary debate, by putting a stop to party strife
      and fostering civic concord?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Disputant. That is my opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this method of bringing back the argument to its true starting-point,
      even the disputant himself would be affected and the truth become manifest
      to his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      His own—that is, the Socratic—method of conducting a rational
      discussion (42) was to proceed step by step from one point of general
      agreement to another: "Herein lay the real security of reasoning," (43) he
      would say; and for this reason he was more successful in winning the
      common assent of his hearers than any one I ever knew. He had a saying
      that Homer had conferred on Odyesseus the title of a safe, unerring
      orator, (44) because he had the gift to lead the discussion from one
      commonly accepted opinion to another.

      VII
    </p>
    <p>
      The frankness and simplicity with which Socrates endeavoured to declare
      his own opinions, in dealing with those who conversed with him, (1) is, I
      think, conclusively proved by the above instances; at the same time, as I
      hope now to show, he was no less eager to cultivate a spirit of
      independence in others, which would enable them to stand alone in all
      transactions suited to their powers.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (1) Or, "who frequented his society, is, I hope, clear from what has
    been said."
</pre>
    <p>
      Of all the men I have ever known, he was most anxious to ascertain in what
      any of those about him was really versed; and within the range of his own
      knowledge he showed the greatest zeal in teaching everything which it
      befits the true gentleman (2) to know; or where he was deficient in
      knowledge himself, (3) he would introduce his friends to those who knew.
      (4) He did not fail to teach them also up to what point it was proper for
      an educated man to acquire empiric knowledge of any particular matter. (5)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (2) Lit. "a beautiful and good man."

 (3) Or, "where he lacked acquaintance with the matter himself." See,
    for an instance, "Econ." iii. 14.

 (4) "To those who had the special knowledge"; "a connoisseur in the
    matter."

 (5) Or, "of any particular branch of learning"; "in each department of
    things."
</pre>
    <p>
      To take geometry as an instance: Every one (he would say) ought to be
      taught geometry so far, at any rate, as to be able, if necessary, to take
      over or part with a piece of land, or to divide it up or assign a portion
      of it for cultivation, (6) and in every case by geometric rule. (7) That
      amount of geometry was so simple indeed, and easy to learn, that it only
      needed ordinary application of the mind to the method of mensuration, and
      the student could at once ascertain the size of the piece of land, and,
      with the satisfaction of knowing its measurement, depart in peace. But he
      was unable to approve of the pursuit of geometry up to the point at which
      it became a study of unintelligible diagrams. (8) What the use of these
      might be, he failed, he said, to see; and yet he was not unversed in these
      recondite matters himself. (9) These things, he would say, were enough to
      wear out a man's life, and to hinder him from many other more useful
      studies. (10)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (6) {e ergon apodeixasthai}, or "and to explain the process." Cf.
    Plat. "Rep." vii. 528 D. See R. Kuhner ad loc. for other
    interpretations of the phrase. Cf. Max. Tyr. xxxvii. 7.

 (7) Or, "by correct measurement"; lit. "by measurement of the earth."

 (8) Cf. Aristot. "Pol." v. (viii.) 2; Cic. "Acad. Post." I. iv. 15.
    For the attitude compare the attitude of a philosopher in other
    respects most unlike Socrates—August Comte, e.g. as to the
    futility of sidereal astronomy, "Pos. Pol." i. 412 (Bridges).

 (9) Cf. Isocr. "On the Antidosis," 258-269, as to the true place of
    "Eristic" in education. See above, IV. ii. 10.

 (10) Cf. A. Comte as to "perte intellectuelle" in the pursuit of
    barren studies.
</pre>
    <p>
      Again, a certain practical knowledge of astronomy, a certain skill in the
      study of the stars, he strongly insisted on. Every one should know enough
      of the science to be able to discover the hour of the night or the season
      of the month or year, for the purposes of travel by land or sea—the
      march, the voyage, and the regulations of the watch; (11) and in general,
      with regard to all matters connected with the night season, or with the
      month, or the year, (12) it was well to have such reliable data to go upon
      as would serve to distinguish the various times and seasons. But these,
      again, were pieces of knowledge easily learnt from night sportsmen, (13)
      pilots of vessels, and many others who make it their business to know such
      things. As to pushing the study of astronomy so far as to include a
      knowledge of the movements of bodies outside our own orbit, whether
      planets or stars of eccentric movement, (14) or wearing oneself out
      endeavouring to discover their distances from the earth, their periods,
      and their causes, (15) all this he strongly discountenanced; for he saw
      (he said) no advantage in these any more than in the former studies. And
      yet he was not unversed (16) in the subtleties of astronomy any more than
      in those of geometry; only these, again, he insisted, were sufficient to
      wear out a man's lifetime, and to keep him away from many more useful
      pursuits.

    <p>
      And to speak generally, in regard of things celestial he set his face
      against attempts to excogitate the machinery by which the divine power
      formed its several operations. (17) Not only were these matters beyond
      man's faculties to discover, as he believed, but the attempt to search out
      what the gods had not chosen to reveal could hardly (he supposed) be well
      pleasing in their sight. Indeed, the man who tortured his brains about
      such subjects stood a fair chance of losing his wits entirely, just as
      Anaxagoras, (18) the headiest speculator of them all, in his attempt to
      explain the divine mechanism, had somewhat lost his head. Anaxagoras took
      on himself to assert that sun and fire are identical, (19) ignoring the
      fact that human beings can easily look at fire, but to gaze steadily into
      the face of the sun is given to no man; or that under the influence of his
      rays the colour of the skin changes, but under the rays of fire not. (20)
      He forgot that no plant or vegetation springs from earth's bosom with
      healthy growth without the help of sunlight, whilst the influence of fire
      is to parch up everything, and to destroy life; and when he came to speak
      of the sun as being a "red-hot stone" he ignored another fact, that a
      stone in fire neither lights up nor lasts, whereas the sun-god abides for
      ever with intensist brilliancy undimmed.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (17) Or, "he tried to divert one from becoming overly-wise in heavenly
    matters and the 'mecanique celeste' of the Godhead in His several
    operations." See above, I. i. 11. See Grote, "Plato," i. 438.

 (19) Or, "that the sun was simply a fire, forgetting so simple a fact
    as that."

 (20) Or, "the complexion darkens, whereas fire has no such effect."
</pre>
    <p>
      Socrates inculcated the study of reasoning processes, (21) but in these,
      equally with the rest, he bade the student beware of vain and idle
      over-occupation. Up to the limit set by utility, he was ready to join in
      any investigation, and to follow out an argument with those who were with
      him; but there he stopped. He particularly urged those who were with him
      to pay the utmost attention to health. They would learn all it was
      possible to learn from adepts, and not only so, but each one individually
      should take pains to discover, by a lifelong observation of his own case,
      what particular regimen, what meat or drink, or what kind of work, best
      suited him; these he should turn to account with a view to leading the
      healthiest possible life. It would be no easy matter for any one who would
      follow this advice, and study his own idiosyncrasy, to find a doctor to
      improve either on the diagnosis or the treatment requisite. (22)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (21) {logismous} = (1) "arithmetic," (2) "calculation," (3)
    "syllogistic reasoning." See L. Dind. "Index. Gr." s.v., and
    Kuhner ad loc.; cf. Plat. "Gorg." 451 C. It is important to decide
    which form of "logism" is meant here.

 (22) Or, "to find a doctor better able than himself to 'diagnose' and
    prescribe a treatment congenial to health." Cf. Tac. "Ann." vi.

</pre>
    <p>
      Where any one came seeking for help which no human wisdom could supply, he
      would counsel him to give heed to "divination." He who has the secret of
      the means whereby the gods give signs to men touching their affairs can
      never surely find himself bereft of heavenly guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      VIII
    </p>
    <p>
      Now if any one should be disposed to set the statement of Socrates
      touching the divinity (1) which warned him what he ought to do or not to
      do, against the fact that he was sentenced to death by the board of
      judges, and argue that thereby Socrates stood convicted of lying and
      delusion in respect of this "divinity" of his, I would have him to note in
      the first place that, at the date of his trial, Socrates was already so
      far advanced in years that had he not died then his life would have
      reached its natural term soon afterwards; and secondly, as matters went,
      he escaped life's bitterest load (2) in escaping those years which bring a
      diminution of intellectual force to all—instead of which he was
      called upon to exhibit the full robustness of his soul and acquire glory
      in addition, (3) partly by the style of his defence—felicitous alike
      in its truthfulness, its freedom, and its rectitude (4)—and partly
      by the manner in which he bore the sentence of condemnation with infinite
      gentleness and manliness. Since no one within the memory of man, it is
      admitted, ever bowed his head to death more nobly. After the sentence he
      must needs live for thirty days, since it was the month of the "Delia,"
      (5) and the law does not suffer any man to die by the hand of the public
      executioner until the sacred embassy return from Delos. During the whole
      of that period (as his acquaintances without exception can testify) his
      life proceeded as usual. There was nothing to mark the difference between
      now and formerly in the even tenour of its courage; and it was a life
      which at all times had been a marvel of cheerfulness and calm content. (6)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (1) Or, "the words of Socrates with regard to a divine something which
    warned him," etc.

 (2) The phraseology is poetical.

 (3) Or, "in a manner which redounded to his glory."

 (4) Or, "marvellous alike for the sincerity of its language, the free
    unbroken spirit of its delivery, and the absolute rectitude of the
    speaker."

 (5) i.e. the lesser "Delian" solemnities, an annual festival
    instituted, it was said, by Theseus. See Plut. "Theseus," 23
    (Clough, i. 19); and for the whole matter see Plat. "Phaed." 58
    foll.

 (6) Cf. Arist. "Frogs," 82; of Sophocles, {o d' eukolos men enthad',
    eukolos d' ekei}.

 (Let us pause and ask how could man die more nobly and more
beautifully than in the way described? or put it thus: dying so,
then was his death most noble and most beautiful; and being the most
beautiful, then was it also the most fortunate and heaven-blest; and
being most blessed of heaven, then was it also most precious in the
sight of God.) (7)

 (7) This is bracketed as spurious by Sauppe and other commentators.
    But see "Cyrop." VIII. ii. 7, 8, for similar ineptitude of style.
    R. Kuhner defends the passage as genuine.
</pre>
    <p>
      And now I will mention further certain things which I have heard from
      Hermogenes, the son of Hipponicus, (8) concerning him. He said that even
      after Meletus (9) had drawn up the indictment, he himself used to hear
      Socrates conversing and discussing everything rather than the suit
      impending, and had ventured to suggest that he ought to be considering the
      line of his defence, to which, in the first instance, the master answered:
      "Do I not seem to you to have been practising that my whole life long?"
      And upon his asking "How?" added in explanation that he had passed his
      days in nothing else save in distinguishing between what is just and what
      is unjust (right and wrong), and in doing what is right and abstaining
      from what is wrong; "which conduct" (he added) "I hold to be the finest
      possible practice for my defence"; and when he (Hermogenes), returning to
      the point again, pleaded with Socrates: "Do you not see, Socrates, how
      commonly it happens that an Athenian jury, under the influence of
      argument, condemns innocent people to death and acquits real criminals?"—Socrates
      replied, "I assure you, Hermogenes, that each time I have essayed to give
      my thoughts to the defence which I am to make before the court, the
      divinity (10) has opposed me." And when he (Hermogenes) exclaimed, "How
      strange!"—"Do you find it strange" (he continued), "that to the
      Godhead it should appear better for me to close my life at once? Do you
      not know that up to the present moment there is no man whom I can admit to
      have spent a better or happier life than mine. Since theirs I regard as
      the best of lives who study best to become as good as may be, and theirs
      the happiest who have the liveliest sense of growth in goodness; and such,
      hitherto, is the happy fortune which I perceive to have fallen to my lot.
      To such conclusion I have come, not only in accidental intercourse with
      others, but by a strict comparison drawn between myself and others, and in
      this faith I continue to this day; and not I only, but my friends continue
      in a like persuasion with regard to me, not for the lame reason that they
      are my friends and love me (or else would others have been in like case as
      regards their friends), but because they are persuaded that by being with
      me they will attain to their full height of goodness. But, if I am
      destined to prolong my days, maybe I shall be enforced to pay in full the
      penalties of old age—to see and hear less keenly, to fail in
      intellectual force, and to leave school, as it were, more of a dunce than
      when I came, less learned and more forgetful—in a word, I shall fall
      from my high estate, and daily grow worse in that wherein aforetime I
      excelled. But indeed, were it possible to remain unconscious of the
      change, the life left would scarcely be worth living; but given that there
      is a consciousness of the change, then must the existence left to live be
      found by comparison insipid, joyless, a death in life, devoid of life's
      charm. But indeed, if it is reserved for me to die unjustly, then on those
      who unjustly slay me lies the shame (since, given injustice is base, how
      can any unjust action whatsoever fail of baseness?) (11) But for me what
      disgrace is it that others should fail of a just decision and right acts
      concerning me?... I see before me a long line of predecessors on this
      road, and I mark the reputation also among posterity which they have left.
      (12) I note how it varies according as they did or suffered wrong, and for
      myself I know that I too, although I die to-day, shall obtain from mankind
      a consideration far different from that which will be accorded to those
      who put me to death. I know that undying witness will be borne me to this
      effect, that I never at any time did wrong to any man, or made him a worse
      man, but ever tried to make those better who were with me."

    posterity."
</pre>
    <p>
      Such are the words which he spoke in conversation with Hermogenes and the
      rest. But amongst those who knew Socrates and recognised what manner of
      man he was, all who make virtue and perfection their pursuit still to this
      day cease not to lament his loss with bitterest regret, as for one who
      helped them in the pursuit of virtue as none else could.
    </p>
    <p>
      To me, personally, he was what I have myself endeavoured to describe: so
      pious and devoutly religious (13) that he would take no step apart from
      the will of heaven; so just and upright that he never did even a trifling
      injury to any living soul; so self-controlled, so temperate, that he never
      at any time chose the sweeter in place of the better; so sensible, and
      wise, and prudent that in distinguishing the better from the worse he
      never erred; nor had he need of any helper, but for the knowledge of these
      matters, his judgment was at once infallible and self-sufficing. Capable
      of reasonably setting forth and defining moral questions, (14) he was also
      able to test others, and where they erred, to cross-examine and convict
      them, and so to impel and guide them in the path of virtue and noble
      manhood. With these characteristics, he seemed to be the very
      impersonation of human perfection and happiness. (15)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve"> (13) Or, "of such piety and religious devotedness... of such
    rectitude... of such sobreity and self-control... of such
    sound sense and wisdom..."

 (14) Or, "gifted with an ability logically to set forth and to define
    moral subtleties."

 (15) Or, "I look upon him as at once the best and happiest of men."
</pre>
    <p>
      Such is our estimate. If the verdict fail to satisfy I would ask those who
      disagree with it to place the character of any other side by side with
      this delineation, and then pass sentence.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
