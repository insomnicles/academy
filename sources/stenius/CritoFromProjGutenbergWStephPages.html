    PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:<br>
    Socrates, Crito.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    SCENE: The Prison of Socrates.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Why have you come at this hour, Crito? it must be quite
    early?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Yes, certainly.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: What is the exact time?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: The dawn is breaking.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: I wonder that the keeper of the prison would let you in.<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: He knows me, because I often come, Socrates; moreover, I have
    done him a kindness.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: And are you only just arrived?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: No, I came some time ago.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Then why did you sit and say nothing, instead of at once
    awakening me?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: I should not have liked myself, Socrates, to be in such great
    trouble and unrest as you are—indeed I should not: I have been
    watching with amazement your peaceful slumbers; and for that reason
    I did not awake you, because I wished to minimize the pain. I have
    always thought you to be of a happy disposition; but never did I see
    anything like the easy, tranquil manner in which you bear this
    calamity.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Why, Crito, when a man has reached my age he ought not to
    be repining at the approach of death.<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: And yet other old men find themselves in similar misfortunes,
    and age does not prevent them from repining.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: That is true. But you have not told me why you come at
    this early hour.<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: I come to bring you a message which is sad and painful; not,
    as I believe, to yourself, but to all of us who are your friends,
    and saddest of all to me.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: What? Has the ship come from Delos, on the arrival of
    which I am to die?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: No, the ship has not actually arrived, but she will probably
    be here to-day, as persons who have come from Sunium tell me that
    they have left her there; and therefore to-morrow, Socrates, will be
    the last day of your life.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Very well, Crito; if such is the will of God, I am
    willing; but my belief is that there will be a delay of a day.<br>
    <b>44</b><br>
    CRITO: Why do you think so?<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: I will tell you. I am to die on the day after the arrival
    of the ship?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Yes; that is what the authorities say.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: But I do not think that the ship will be here until
    to-morrow; this I infer from a vision which I had last night, or
    rather only just now, when you fortunately allowed me to sleep.<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: And what was the nature of the vision?<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: There appeared to me the likeness of a woman, fair and
    comely, clothed in bright raiment, who called to me and said: O
    Socrates,<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    ‘The third day hence to fertile Phthia shalt thou go.’ 3<br>
    CRITO: What a singular dream, Socrates!<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: There can be no doubt about the meaning, Crito, I think.<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Yes; the meaning is only too clear. But, oh! my beloved
    Socrates, let me entreat you once more to take my advice and escape.
    For if you die I shall not only lose a friend who can never be
    replaced, but there is another evil: people who do not know you and
    me will believe that I might have saved you if I had been willing to
    give money, but that I did not care. Now, can there be a worse
    disgrace than this—that I should be thought to value money more than
    the life of a friend? For the many will not be persuaded that I
    wanted you to escape, and that you refused.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: But why, my dear Crito, should we care about the opinion
    of the many? Good men, and they are the only persons who are worth
    considering, will think of these things truly as they occurred.<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: But you see, Socrates, that the opinion of the many must be
    regarded, for what is now happening shows that they can do the
    greatest evil to anyone who has lost their good opinion.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: I only wish it were so, Crito; and that the many could do
    the greatest evil; for then they would also be able to do the
    greatest good—and what a fine thing this would be! But in reality
    they can do neither; for they cannot make a man either wise or
    foolish; and whatever they do is the result of chance.<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Well, I will not dispute with you; but please to tell me,
    Socrates, whether you are not acting out of regard to me and your
    other friends: are you not afraid that if you escape from prison we
    may get into trouble with the informers for having stolen you away,
    and lose either the whole or a great part of our property; or that
    even a worse evil may happen to us? <b>45 </b>Now, if you fear on
    our account, be at ease; for in order to save you, we ought surely
    to run this, or even a greater risk; be persuaded, then, and do as I
    say.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Yes, Crito, that is one fear which you mention, but by no
    means the only one.<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Fear not—there are persons who are willing to get you out of
    prison at no great cost; and as for the informers, they are far from
    being exorbitant in their demands—a little money will satisfy them.
    My means, which are certainly ample, are at your service, and if you
    have a scruple about spending all mine, here are strangers who will
    give you the use of theirs; and one of them, Simmias the Theban, has
    brought a large sum of money for this very purpose; and Cebes and
    many others are prepared to spend their money in helping you to
    escape. I say, therefore, do not hesitate on our account, and do not
    say, as you did in the court 4 that you will have a difficulty in
    knowing what to do with yourself anywhere else. For men will love
    you in other places to which you may go, and not in Athens only;
    there are friends of mine in Thessaly, if you like to go to them,
    who will value and protect you, and no Thessalian will give you any
    trouble. Nor can I think that you are at all justified, Socrates, in
    betraying your own life when you might be saved; in acting thus you
    are playing into the hands of your enemies, who are hurrying on your
    destruction. And further I should say that you are deserting your
    own children; for you might bring them up and educate them; instead
    of which you go away and leave them, and they will have to take
    their chance; and if they do not meet with the usual fate of
    orphans, there will be small thanks to you. No man should bring
    children into the world who is unwilling to persevere to the end in
    their nurture and education. But you appear to be choosing the
    easier part, not the better and manlier, which would have been more
    becoming in one who professes to care for virtue in all his actions,
    like yourself. And indeed, I am ashamed not only of you, but of us
    who are your friends, when I reflect that the whole business will be
    attributed entirely to our want of courage. The trial need never
    have come on, or might have been managed differently; and this last
    act, or crowning folly, will seem to have occurred through our
    negligence and <b>46 </b>cowardice, who might have saved you, if
    we had been good for anything; and you might have saved yourself,
    for there was no difficulty at all. See now, Socrates, how sad and
    discreditable are the consequences, both to us and you. Make up your
    mind then, or rather have your mind already made up, for the time of
    deliberation is over, and there is only one thing to be done, which
    must be done this very night, and, if we delay at all, will be no
    longer practicable or possible; I beseech you therefore, Socrates,
    be persuaded by me, and do as I say.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Dear Crito, your zeal is invaluable, if a right one; but
    if wrong, the greater the zeal the greater the danger; and therefore
    we ought to consider whether I shall or shall not do as you say. For
    I am and always have been one of those natures who must be guided by
    reason, whatever the reason may be which upon reflection appears to
    me to be the best; and now that this chance has befallen me, I
    cannot repudiate my own words: the principles which I have hitherto
    honoured and revered I still honour, and unless we can at once find
    other and better principles, I am certain not to agree with you; no,
    not even if the power of the multitude could inflict many more
    imprisonments, confiscations, deaths, frightening us like children
    with hobgoblin terrors. 5 What will be the fairest way of
    considering the question? Shall I return to your old argument about
    the opinions of men?—we were saying that some of them are to be
    regarded, and others not. Now were we right in maintaining this
    before I was condemned? And has the argument which was once good now
    proved to be talk for the sake of talking—mere childish nonsense?
    That is what I want to consider with your help, Crito:—whether,
    under my present circumstances, the argument appears to be in any
    way different or not; and is to be allowed by me or disallowed. That
    argument, which, as I believe, is maintained by many persons of
    authority, was to the effect, as I was saying, that the opinions of
    some men are to be regarded, and of other men not to be regarded.
    Now you, Crito, are not going to die to-morrow—at least, there is no
    human probability of this— <b>47 </b>and therefore you are
    disinterested and not liable to be deceived by the circumstances in
    which you are placed. Tell me then, whether I am right in saying
    that some opinions, and the opinions of some men only, are to be
    valued, and that other opinions, and the opinions of other men, are
    not to be valued. I ask you whether I was right in maintaining this?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Certainly.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: The good are to be regarded, and not the bad?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Yes.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: And the opinions of the wise are good, and the opinions of
    the unwise are evil?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Certainly.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: And what was said about another matter? Is the pupil who
    devotes himself to the practice of gymnastics supposed to attend to
    the praise and blame and opinion of every man, or of one man
    only—his physician or trainer, whoever he may be?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Of one man only.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: And he ought to fear the censure and welcome the praise of
    that one only, and not of the many?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Clearly so.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: And he ought to act and train, and eat and drink in the
    way which seems good to his single master who has understanding,
    rather than according to the opinion of all other men put together?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: True.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: And if he disobeys and disregards the opinion and approval
    of the one, and regards the opinion of the many who have no
    understanding, will he not suffer evil?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Certainly he will.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: And what will the evil be, whither tending and what
    affecting, in the disobedient person?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Clearly, affecting the body; that is what is destroyed by the
    evil.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Very good; and is not this true, Crito, of other things
    which we need not separately enumerate? In questions of just and
    unjust, fair and foul, good and evil, which are the subjects of our
    present consultation, ought we to follow the opinion of the many and
    to fear them; or the opinion of the one man who has understanding?
    ought we not to fear and reverence him more than all the rest of the
    world: and if we desert him shall we not destroy and injure that
    principle in us which may be assumed to be improved by justice and
    deteriorated by injustice—there is such a principle?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Certainly there is, Socrates.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Take a parallel instance:—if, acting under the advice of
    those who have no understanding, we destroy that which is improved
    by health and is deteriorated by disease, would life be worth
    having? And that which has been destroyed is—the body?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Yes.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Could we live, having an evil and corrupted body?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Certainly not.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: And will life be worth having, if that higher part of man
    be destroyed, which is improved by justice and depraved by
    injustice? Do we suppose that principle, whatever it <b>48 </b>may
    be in man, which has to do with justice and injustice, to be
    inferior to the body?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Certainly not.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: More honourable than the body?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Far more.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Then, my friend, we must not regard what the many say of
    us; but what he, the one man who has understanding of just and
    unjust, will say, and what the truth will say. And therefore you
    begin in error when you advise that we should regard the opinion of
    the many about just and unjust, good and evil, honourable and
    dishonourable.—‘Well,’ someone will say, ‘but the many can kill us.’<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Yes, Socrates; that will clearly be the answer.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: And it is true; but still I find with surprise that the
    old argument is unshaken as ever. And I should like to know whether
    I may say the same of another proposition—that not life, but a good
    life, is to be chiefly valued?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Yes, that also remains unshaken.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: And a good life is equivalent to a just and honourable
    one—that holds also?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Yes, it does.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: From these premises I proceed to argue the question
    whether I ought or ought not to try and escape without the consent
    of the Athenians: and if I am clearly right in escaping, then I will
    make the attempt; but if not, I will abstain. The other
    considerations which you mention, of money and loss of character and
    the duty of educating one’s children, are, I fear, only the
    doctrines of the multitude, who would be as ready to restore people
    to life, if they were able, as they are to put them to death—and
    with as little reason. But now, since the argument has thus far
    prevailed, the only question which remains to be considered is
    whether we shall do rightly either in escaping or in suffering
    others to aid in our escape and paying them in money and thanks, or
    whether in reality we shall not do rightly; and if the latter, then
    death or any other calamity which may ensue on my remaining here
    must not be allowed to enter into the calculation.<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: I think that you are right, Socrates; how then shall we
    proceed?<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Let us consider the matter together, and do you either
    refute me if you can, and I will be convinced; or else cease, my
    dear friend, from repeating to me that I ought to escape against the
    wishes of the Athenians: for I highly value your attempts to
    persuade me to do so, but I may not be persuaded against my own
    better judgment. <b>49 </b>And now please to consider my first
    position, and try how you can best answer me.<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: I will.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: <b>Are we to say that we are never intentionally to do
      wrong, or that in one way we ought and in another way we ought not
      to do wrong, or is doing wrong always evil and dishonourable,</b>
    as I was just now saying, and as has been already acknowledged by
    us? Are all our former admissions which were made within a few days
    to be thrown away? And have we, at our age, been earnestly
    discoursing with one another all our life long only to discover that
    we are no better than children? Or, in spite of the opinion of the
    many, and in spite of consequences whether better or worse, shall we
    insist on the truth of what was then said, that injustice is always
    an evil and dishonour to him who acts unjustly? Shall we say so or
    not?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Yes.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Then we must do no wrong?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Certainly not.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Nor, when injured, injure in return, as the many imagine;
    for we must injure no one at all? 6<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Clearly not.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Again, Crito, may we do evil?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Surely not, Socrates.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: And what of doing evil in return for evil, which is the
    morality of the many—is that just or not?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Not just.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: For doing evil to another is the same as injuring him?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Very true.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Then we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil to
    anyone, whatever evil we may have suffered from him. But I would
    have you consider, Crito, whether you really mean what you are
    saying. For this opinion has never been held, and never will be
    held, by any considerable number of persons; and those who are
    agreed and those who are not agreed upon this point have no common
    ground, and can only despise one another when they see how widely
    they differ. Tell me, then, whether you agree with and assent to my
    first principle, that neither injury nor retaliation nor warding off
    evil by evil is ever right. And shall that be the premise of our
    argument? Or do you decline and dissent from this? For so I have
    ever thought, and continue to think; but, if you are of another
    opinion, let me hear what you have to say. If, however, you remain
    of the same mind as formerly, I will proceed to the next step.<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: You may proceed, for I have not changed my mind.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Then I will go on to the next point, which may be put in
    the form of a question:—Ought a man to do what he admits to be
    right, or ought he to betray the right?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: He ought to do what he thinks right.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: But if this is true, what is the application? In leaving
    the prison against the will of the Athenians, <b>50 </b>do I wrong
    any? or rather do I not wrong those whom I ought least to wrong? Do
    I not desert the principles which were acknowledged by us to be
    just—what do you say?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: I cannot tell, Socrates; for I do not know.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Then consider the matter in this way:—Imagine that I am
    about to play truant (you may call the proceeding by any name which
    you like), and the laws and the government come and interrogate me:
    ‘Tell us, Socrates,’ they say; ‘what are you about? are you not
    going by an act of yours to overturn us—the laws, and the whole
    state, as far as in you lies? Do you imagine that a state can
    subsist and not be overthrown, in which the decisions of law have no
    power, but are set aside and trampled upon by individuals?’ What
    will be our answer, Crito, to these and the like words? Anyone, and
    especially a rhetorician, will have a good deal to say on behalf of
    the law which requires a sentence to be carried out. He will argue
    that this law should not be set aside; and shall we reply, ‘Yes; but
    the state has injured us and given an unjust sentence.’ Suppose I
    say that?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: Very good, Socrates.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: ‘And was that our agreement with you?’ the law would
    answer; ‘or were you to abide by the sentence of the state?’ And if
    I were to express my astonishment at their words, the law would
    probably add: ‘Answer, Socrates, instead of opening your eyes—you
    are in the habit of asking and answering questions. Tell us,—What
    complaint have you to make against us which justifies you in
    attempting to destroy us and the state? In the first place did we
    not bring you into existence? Your father married your mother by our
    aid and begat you. Say whether you have any objection to urge
    against those of us who regulate marriage?’ None, I should reply.
    ‘Or against those of us who after birth regulate the nurture and
    education of children, in which you also were trained? Were not the
    laws, which have the charge of education, right in commanding your
    father to train you in music and gymnastic?’ Right, I should reply.
    ‘Well then, since you were brought into the world and nurtured and
    educated by us, can you deny in the first place that you are our
    child and slave, as your fathers were before you? And if this is
    true you are not on equal terms with us; nor can you think that you
    have a right to do to us what we are doing to you. <b>51 </b>Would
    you have any right to strike or revile or do any other evil to your
    father or your master, if you had one, because you have been struck
    or reviled by him, or received some other evil at his hands? You
    would not say this. And because we think right to destroy you, do
    you think that you have any right to destroy us in return, and your
    country as far as in you lies? Will you, O professor of true virtue,
    pretend that you are justified in this? Has a philosopher like you
    failed to discover that our country is more to be valued and higher
    and holier far than mother or father or any ancestor, and more to be
    regarded in the eyes of the gods and of men of understanding? also
    to be soothed, and gently and reverently entreated when angry, even
    more than a father, and either to be persuaded, or if not persuaded,
    to be obeyed? And when we are punished by her, whether with
    imprisonment or stripes, the punishment is to be endured in silence;
    and if she lead us to wounds or death in battle, thither we follow
    as is right; neither may anyone yield or retreat or leave his rank,
    but whether in battle or in a court of law, or in any other place,
    he must do what his city and his country order him; or he must
    change their view of what is just: and if he may do no violence to
    his father or mother, much less may he do violence to his country.’
    What answer shall we make to this, Crito? Do the laws speak truly,
    or do they not?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: I think that they do.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Then the laws will say: ‘Consider, Socrates, if we are
    speaking truly that in your present attempt you are going to do us
    an injury. For, having brought you into the world, and nurtured and
    educated you, and given you and every other citizen a share in every
    good which we had to give, we further proclaim to any Athenian by
    the liberty which we allow him, that if he does not like us when he
    has become of age and has seen the ways of the city, and made our
    acquaintance, he may go where he pleases and take his goods with
    him. None of us laws will forbid him or interfere with him. Anyone
    who does not like us and the city, and who wants to emigrate to a
    colony or to any other city, may go where he likes, retaining his
    property. But he who has experience of the manner in which we order
    justice and administer the state, and still remains, has entered
    into an implied contract that he will do as we command him. And he
    who disobeys us is, as we maintain, thrice wrong; first, because in
    disobeying us he is disobeying his parents; secondly, because we are
    the authors of his education; <b>52 </b>thirdly, because he has
    made an agreement with us that he will duly obey our commands;
    and&nbsp;<b></b>t<b>he neither obeys them nor convinces us that our
      commands are unjust</b>; and we do not rudely impose them, but
    give him the alternative of obeying or convincing us;—that is what
    we offer, and he does neither. These are the sort of accusations to
    which, as we were saying, you, Socrates, will be exposed if you
    accomplish your intentions; you, above all other Athenians.’<br>
    <br>
    Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else? they will justly
    retort upon me that I above all other men have acknowledged the
    agreement. ‘There is clear proof,’ they will say, ‘Socrates, that we
    and the city were not displeasing to you. Of all Athenians you have
    been the most constant resident in the city, which, as you never
    leave, you may be supposed to love. 7 For you never went out of the
    city either to see the games, except once when you went to the
    Isthmus, or to any other place unless when you were on military
    service; nor did you travel as other men do. Nor had you any
    curiosity to know other states or their laws: your affections did
    not go beyond us and our state; we were your especial favourites,
    and you acquiesced in our government of you; and here in this city
    you begat your children, which is a proof of your satisfaction.
    Moreover, you might in the course of the trial, if you had liked,
    have fixed the penalty at banishment; the state which refuses to let
    you go now would have let you go then. But you pretended that you
    preferred death to exile, 8 and that you were not unwilling to die.
    And now you have forgotten these fine sentiments, and pay no respect
    to us the laws, of whom you are the destroyer; and are doing what
    only a miserable slave would do, running away and turning your back
    upon the compacts and agreements which you made as a citizen. And
    first of all answer this very question: Are we right in saying that
    you agreed to be governed according to us in deed, and not in word
    only? Is that true or not?’ How shall we answer, Crito? Must we not
    assent?<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: We cannot help it, Socrates.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Then will they not say: ‘You, Socrates, are breaking the
    covenants and agreements which you made with us at your leisure, not
    in any haste or under any compulsion or deception, but after you
    have had seventy years to think of them, during which time you were
    at liberty to leave the city, if we were not to your mind, or if our
    covenants appeared to you to be unfair. <b>53 </b>You had your
    choice, and might have gone either to Lacedaemon or Crete, both
    which states are often praised by you for their good government, or
    to some other Hellenic or foreign state. Whereas you, above all
    other Athenians, seemed to be so fond of the state, or, in other
    words, of us, her laws (and who would care about a state which has
    no laws?), that you never stirred out of her; the halt, the blind,
    the maimed were not more stationary in her than you were. And now
    you run away and forsake your agreements. Not so, Socrates, if you
    will take our advice; do not make yourself ridiculous by escaping
    out of the city.<br>
    <br>
    ‘For just consider, if you transgress and err in this sort of way,
    what good will you do either to yourself or to your friends? That
    your friends will be driven into exile and deprived of citizenship,
    or will lose their property, is tolerably certain; and you yourself,
    if you fly to one of the neighbouring cities, as, for example,
    Thebes or Megara, both of which are well governed, will come to them
    as an enemy, Socrates, and their government will be against you, and
    all patriotic citizens will cast an evil eye upon you as a subverter
    of the laws, and you will confirm in the minds of the judges the
    justice of their own condemnation of you. For he who is a corrupter
    of the laws is more than likely to be a corrupter of the young and
    foolish portion of mankind. Will you then flee from well-ordered
    cities and virtuous men? and is existence worth having on these
    terms? Or will you go to them without shame, and talk to them,
    Socrates? And what will you say to them? What you say here about
    virtue and justice and institutions and laws being the best things
    among men? Would that be decent of you? Surely not. But if you go
    away from well-governed states to Crito’s friends in Thessaly, where
    there is great disorder and licence, they will be charmed to hear
    the tale of your escape from prison, set off with ludicrous
    particulars of the manner in which you were wrapped in a goatskin or
    some other disguise, and metamorphosed as the manner is of runaways;
    but will there be no one to remind you that in your old age you were
    not ashamed to violate the most sacred laws from a miserable desire
    of a little more life? Perhaps not, if you keep them in a good
    temper; but if they are out of temper you will hear many degrading
    things; you will live, but how?—as the flatterer of all men, and the
    servant of all men; and doing what?—eating and drinking in Thessaly,
    having gone abroad in order that you may get a dinner. <b>54&nbsp;</b>
    And where will be your fine sentiments about justice and virtue? Say
    that you wish to live for the sake of your children—you want to
    bring them up and educate them—will you take them into Thessaly and
    deprive them of Athenian citizenship? Is this the benefit which you
    will confer upon them? Or are you under the impression that they
    will be better cared for and educated here if you are still alive,
    although absent from them; for your friends will take care of them?
    Do you fancy that if you are an inhabitant of Thessaly they will
    take care of them, and if you are an inhabitant of the other world
    that they will not take care of them? Nay; but if they who call
    themselves friends are good for anything, they will—to be sure they
    will.<br>
    <br>
    ‘Listen, then, Socrates, to us who have brought you up. Think not of
    life and children first, and of justice afterwards, but of justice
    first, that you may be justified before the princes of the world
    below. For neither will you nor any that belong to you be happier or
    holier or juster in this life, or happier in another, if you do as
    Crito bids. Now you depart in innocence, a sufferer and not a doer
    of evil; a victim, not of the laws, but of men. But if you go forth,
    returning evil for evil, and injury for injury, breaking the
    covenants and agreements which you have made with us, and wronging
    those whom you ought least of all to wrong, that is to say,
    yourself, your friends, your country, and us, we shall be angry with
    you while you live, and our brethren, the laws in the world below,
    will receive you as an enemy; for they will know that you have done
    your best to destroy us. Listen, then, to us and not to Crito.’<br>
    <br>
    This, dear Crito, is the voice which I seem to hear murmuring in my
    ears, like the sound of the flute in the ears of the mystic; that
    voice, I say, is humming in my ears, and prevents me from hearing
    any other. And I know that anything more which you may say will be
    vain. Yet speak, if you have anything to say.<br>
    <br>
    CRITO: I have nothing to say, Socrates.<br>
    <br>
    SOCRATES: Leave me then, Crito, to fulfil the will of God, and to
    follow whither he leads. <br>

          Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several
          printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain
          in the US unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we
          usually do not keep eBooks in compliance with any particular
          paper edition.<br>
          <br>
          We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in
          advance of the official release dates, leaving time for better
          editing. Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or
          corrections, even years after the official publication date.<br>
          <br>
          Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final
          til midnight of the last day of the month of any such
          announcement. The official release date of all Project
          Gutenberg eBooks is at Midnight, Central Time, of the last day
          of the stated month. A preliminary version may often be posted
          for suggestion, comment and editing by those who wish to do
          so.<br>

          We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.
          The time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty
          hours to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited,
          copyright searched and analyzed, the copyright letters
          written, etc. Our projected audience is one hundred million
          readers. If the value per text is nominally estimated at one
          dollar then we produce $2 million dollars per hour in 2002 as
          we release over 100 new text files per month: 1240 more eBooks
          in 2001 for a total of 4000+ We are already on our way to
          trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002 If they reach just 1–2% of
          the world’s population then the total will reach over half a
          trillion eBooks given away by year’s end.<br>
          <br>
          The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion
          eBooks! This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred
          million readers, which is only about 4% of the present number
          of computer users.<br>

          We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to
          legally request donations in all 50 states. If your state is
          not listed and you would like to know if we have added it
          since the list you have, just ask.<br>
          <br>
          While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where
          we are not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against
          accepting donations from donors in these states who approach
          us with an offer to donate.<br>
          <br>
          International donations are accepted, but we don’t know
          ANYTHING about how to make them tax-deductible, or even if
          they CAN be made deductible, and don’t have the staff to
          handle it even if there are ways.<br>
