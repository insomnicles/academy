                        <div class="sentence"> The logic of Aristotle is for the most part latent in the dialogues of Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> The nature of definition is explained not by rules but by examples in the Charmides, Lysis, Laches, Protagoras, Meno, Euthyphro, Theaetetus, Gorgias, Republic; the nature of division is likewise illustrated by examples in the Sophist and Statesman; a scheme of categories is found in the Philebus; the true doctrine of contradiction is taught, and the fallacy of arguing in a circle is exposed in the Republic; the nature of synthesis and analysis is graphically described in the Phaedrus; the nature of words is analysed in the Cratylus; the form of the syllogism is indicated in the genealogical trees of the Sophist and Statesman; a true doctrine of predication and an analysis of the sentence are given in the Sophist; the different meanings of one and being are worked out in the Parmenides.</div><div class="sentence"> Here we have most of the important elements of logic, not yet systematized or reduced to an art or science, but scattered up and down as they would naturally occur in ordinary discourse.</div><div class="sentence"> They are of little or no use or significance to us; but because we have grown out of the need of them we should not therefore despise them.</div><div class="sentence"> They are still interesting and instructive for the light which they shed on the history of the human mind.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> There are indeed many old fallacies which linger among us, and new ones are constantly springing up.</div><div class="sentence"> But they are not of the kind to which ancient logic can be usefully applied.</div><div class="sentence"> The weapons of common sense, not the analytics of Aristotle, are needed for their overthrow.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor is the use of the Aristotelian logic any longer natural to us.</div><div class="sentence"> We no longer put arguments into the form of syllogisms like the schoolmen; the simple use of language has been, happily, restored to us.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither do we discuss the nature of the proposition, nor extract hidden truths from the copula, nor dispute any longer about nominalism and realism.</div><div class="sentence"> We do not confuse the form with the matter of knowledge, or invent laws of thought, or imagine that any single science furnishes a principle of reasoning to all the rest.</div><div class="sentence"> Neither do we require categories or heads of argument to be invented for our use.</div><div class="sentence"> Those who have no knowledge of logic, like some of our great physical philosophers, seem to be quite as good reasoners as those who have.</div><div class="sentence"> Most of the ancient puzzles have been settled on the basis of usage and common sense; there is no need to reopen them.</div><div class="sentence"> No science should raise problems or invent forms of thought which add nothing to knowledge and are of no use in assisting the acquisition of it.</div><div class="sentence"> This seems to be the natural limit of logic and metaphysics; if they give us a more comprehensive or a more definite view of the different spheres of knowledge they are to be studied; if not, not.</div><div class="sentence"> The better part of ancient logic appears hardly in our own day to have a separate existence; it is absorbed in two other sciences: (1) rhetoric, if indeed this ancient art be not also fading away into literary criticism; (2) the science of language, under which all questions relating to words and propositions and the combinations of them may properly be included.</div>
