It certainly agrees in tone and\ncharacter with the description of Xenophon, who says in the\n\u201cMemorabilia\u201d that Socrates might have been acquitted \u201cif in\nany moderate degree he would have conciliated the favour of the dicasts;\u201d\nand who informs us in another passage, on the testimony of Hermogenes, the\nfriend of Socrates, that he had no wish to live; and that the divine sign\nrefused to allow him to prepare a defence, and also that Socrates himself\ndeclared this to be unnecessary, on the ground that all his life long he had\nbeen preparing against that hour. For the speech breathes throughout a spirit\nof defiance, \u201c<i>ut non supplex aut reus sed magister aut dominus\nvideretur esse judicum</i>\u201d (Cic. \u201cde Orat.\u201d i. 54); and the\nloose and desultory style is an imitation of the \u201caccustomed\nmanner\u201d in which Socrates spoke in \u201cthe <i>agora</i> and among the\ntables of the money-changers.\u201d The allusion in the \u201cCrito\u201d\n(45 B) may, perhaps, be adduced as a further evidence of the literal accuracy\nof some parts (37 C, D). But in the main it must be regarded as the ideal of\nSocrates, according to Plato\u2019s conception of him, appearing in the\ngreatest and most public scene of his life, and in the height of his triumph,\nwhen he is weakest, and yet his mastery over mankind is greatest, and his\nhabitual irony acquires a new meaning and a sort of tragic pathos in the face\nof death. The facts of his life are summed up, and the features of his\ncharacter are brought out as if by accident in the course of the defence. The\nconversational manner, the seeming want of arrangement, the ironical\nsimplicity, are found to result in a perfect work of art, which is the portrait\nof Socrates.\n</p><i>ut non supplex aut reus sed magister aut dominus\nvideretur esse judicum</i><i>agora</i><p>\nYet some of the topics may have been actually used by Socrates; and the\nrecollection of his very words may have rung in the ears of his disciple. The\n\u201cApology\u201d of Plato may be compared generally with those speeches of\nThucydides in which he has embodied his conception of the lofty character and\npolicy of the great Pericles, and which at the same time furnish a commentary\non the situation of affairs from the point of view of the historian. So in the\n\u201cApology\u201d there is an ideal rather than a literal truth; much is\nsaid which was not said, and is only Plato\u2019s view of the situation. Plato\nwas not, like Xenophon, a chronicler of facts; he does not appear in any of his\nwritings to have aimed at literal accuracy. He is not therefore to be\nsupplemented from the Memorabilia and Symposium of Xenophon, who belongs to an\nentirely different class of writers. The Apology of Plato is not the report of\nwhat Socrates said, but an elaborate composition, quite as much so in fact as\none of the Dialogues. And we may perhaps even indulge in the fancy that the\nactual defence of Socrates was as much greater than the Platonic defence as the\nmaster was greater than the disciple. But in any case, some of the words used\nby him must have been remembered, and some of the facts recorded must have\nactually occurred. It is significant that Plato is said to have been present at\nthe defence (Apol.), as he is also said to have been absent at the last scene\nin the \u201cPh\u00e6do\u201d. Is it fanciful to suppose that he meant to give the\nstamp of authenticity to the one and not to the other?\u2014especially when we\nconsider that these two passages are the only ones in which Plato makes mention\nof himself. The circumstance that Plato was to be one of his sureties for the\npayment of the fine which he proposed has the appearance of truth. More\nsuspicious is the statement that Socrates received the first impulse to his\nfavourite calling of cross-examining the world from the Oracle of Delphi; for\nhe must already have been famous before Chaerephon went to consult the Oracle\n(Riddell), and the story is of a kind which is very likely to have been\ninvented. On the whole we arrive at the conclusion that the\n\u201cApology\u201d is true to the character of Socrates, but we cannot show\nthat any single sentence in it was actually spoken by him. It breathes the\nspirit of Socrates, but has been cast anew in the mould of Plato.\n</p><p>\nThere is not much in the other Dialogues which can be compared with the\n\u201cApology\u201d. The same recollection of his master may have been\npresent to the mind of Plato when depicting the sufferings of the Just in the\n\u201cRepublic\u201d. The \u201cCrito\u201d may also be regarded as a sort\nof appendage to the \u201cApology\u201d, in which Socrates, who has defied\nthe judges, is nevertheless represented as scrupulously obedient to the laws.\nThe idealization of the sufferer is carried still further in the\n\u201cGeorgias\u201d, in which the thesis is maintained, that \u201cto\nsuffer is better than to do evil;\u201d and the art of rhetoric is described\nas only useful for the purpose of self-accusation. The parallelisms which occur\nin the so-called \u201cApology\u201d of Xenophon are not worth noticing,\nbecause the writing in which they are contained is manifestly spurious. The\nstatements of the \u201cMemorabilia\u201d respecting the trial and death of\nSocrates agree generally with Plato; but they have lost the flavour of Socratic\nirony in the narrative of Xenophon.\n</p><p>\nThe \u201cApology\u201d or Platonic defence of Socrates is divided into three\nparts: 1st. The defence properly so called; 2nd. The shorter address in\nmitigation of the penalty; 3rd. The last words of prophetic rebuke and\nexhortation.\n</p><p>\nThe first part commences with an apology for his colloquial style; he is, as he\nhas always been, the enemy of rhetoric, and knows of no rhetoric but truth; he\nwill not falsify his character by making a speech. Then he proceeds to divide\nhis accusers into two classes; first, there is the nameless\naccuser\u2014public opinion. All the world from their earliest years had heard\nthat he was a corrupter of youth, and had seen him caricatured in the\n\u201cClouds\u201d of Aristophanes. Secondly, there are the professed\naccusers, who are but the mouth-piece of the others. The accusations of both\nmight be summed up in a formula. The first say, \u201cSocrates is an evil-doer\nand a curious person, searching into things under the earth and above the\nheaven; and making the worse appear the better cause, and teaching all this to\nothers.\u201d The second, \u201cSocrates is an evil-doer and corrupter of the\nyouth, who does not receive the gods whom the state receives, but introduces\nother new divinities.\u201d These last words appear to have been the actual\nindictment (compare Xen. Mem.); and the previous formula, which is a summary of\npublic opinion, assumes the same legal style.\n</p><p>\nThe answer begins by clearing up a confusion. In the representations of the\nComic poets, and in the opinion of the multitude, he had been identified with\nthe teachers of physical science and with the Sophists. But this was an error.\nFor both of them he professes a respect in the open court, which contrasts with\nhis manner of speaking about them in other places. (Compare for Anaxagoras,\nPh\u00e6do, Laws; for the Sophists, Meno, Republic, Tim., Theaet., Soph., etc.) But\nat the same time he shows that he is not one of them. Of natural philosophy he\nknows nothing; not that he despises such pursuits, but the fact is that he is\nignorant of them, and never says a word about them. Nor is he paid for giving\ninstruction\u2014that is another mistaken notion:\u2014he has nothing to\nteach. But he commends Evenus for teaching virtue at such a\n\u201cmoderate\u201d rate as five min\u00e6. Something of the \u201caccustomed\nirony,\u201d which may perhaps be expected to sleep in the ear of the\nmultitude, is lurking here.\n</p><p>\nHe then goes on to explain the reason why he is in such an evil name. That had\narisen out of a peculiar mission which he had taken upon himself. The\nenthusiastic Chaerephon (probably in anticipation of the answer which he\nreceived) had gone to Delphi and asked the oracle if there was any man wiser\nthan Socrates; and the answer was, that there was no man wiser. What could be\nthe meaning of this\u2014that he who knew nothing, and knew that he knew\nnothing, should be declared by the oracle to be the wisest of men? Reflecting\nupon the answer, he determined to refute it by finding \u201ca wiser;\u201d\nand first he went to the politicians, and then to the poets, and then to the\ncraftsmen, but always with the same result\u2014he found that they knew\nnothing, or hardly anything more than himself; and that the little advantage\nwhich in some cases they possessed was more than counter-balanced by their\nconceit of knowledge. He knew nothing, and knew that he knew nothing: they knew\nlittle or nothing, and imagined that they knew all things. Thus he had passed\nhis life as a sort of missionary in detecting the pretended wisdom of mankind;\nand this occupation had quite absorbed him and taken him away both from public\nand private affairs. Young men of the richer sort had made a pastime of the\nsame pursuit, \u201cwhich was not unamusing.\u201d And hence bitter enmities\nhad arisen; the professors of knowledge had revenged themselves by calling him\na villainous corrupter of youth, and by repeating the commonplaces about\natheism and materialism and sophistry, which are the stock-accusations against\nall philosophers when there is nothing else to be said of them.\n</p><p>\nThe second accusation he meets by interrogating Meletus, who is present and can\nbe interrogated. \u201cIf he is the corrupter, who is the improver of the\ncitizens?\u201d (Compare Meno.) \u201cAll men everywhere.\u201d But how\nabsurd, how contrary to analogy is this! How inconceivable too, that he should\nmake the citizens worse when he has to live with them. This surely cannot be\nintentional; and if unintentional, he ought to have been instructed by Meletus,\nand not accused in the court.\n</p><p>\nBut there is another part of the indictment which says that he teaches men not\nto receive the gods whom the city receives, and has other new gods. \u201cIs\nthat the way in which he is supposed to corrupt the youth?\u201d \u201cYes,\nit is.\u201d \u201cHas he only new gods, or none at all?\u201d \u201cNone\nat all.\u201d \u201cWhat, not even the sun and moon?\u201d \u201cNo; why,\nhe says that the sun is a stone, and the moon earth.\u201d That, replies\nSocrates, is the old confusion about Anaxagoras; the Athenian people are not so\nignorant as to attribute to the influence of Socrates notions which have found\ntheir way into the drama, and may be learned at the theatre. Socrates\nundertakes to show that Meletus (rather unjustifiably) has been compounding a\nriddle in this part of the indictment: \u201cThere are no gods, but Socrates\nbelieves in the existence of the sons of gods, which is absurd.\u201d\n</p><p>\nLeaving Meletus, who has had enough words spent upon him, he returns to the\noriginal accusation. The question may be asked, Why will he persist in\nfollowing a profession which leads him to death? Why?\u2014because he must\nremain at his post where the god has placed him, as he remained at Potidaea,\nand Amphipolis, and Delium, where the generals placed him. Besides, he is not\nso overwise as to imagine that he knows whether death is a good or an evil; and\nhe is certain that desertion of his duty is an evil. Anytus is quite right in\nsaying that they should never have indicted him if they meant to let him go.\nFor he will certainly obey God rather than man; and will continue to preach to\nall men of all ages the necessity of virtue and improvement; and if they refuse\nto listen to him he will still persevere and reprove them. This is his way of\ncorrupting the youth, which he will not cease to follow in obedience to the\ngod, even if a thousand deaths await him.\n</p><p>\nHe is desirous that they should let him live\u2014not for his own sake, but\nfor theirs; because he is their heaven-sent friend (and they will never have\nsuch another), or, as he may be ludicrously described, he is the gadfly who\nstirs the generous steed into motion. Why then has he never taken part in\npublic affairs? Because the familiar divine voice has hindered him; if he had\nbeen a public man, and had fought for the right, as he would certainly have\nfought against the many, he would not have lived, and could therefore have done\nno good. Twice in public matters he has risked his life for the sake of\njustice\u2014once at the trial of the generals; and again in resistance to the\ntyrannical commands of the Thirty.\n</p><p>\nBut, though not a public man, he has passed his days in instructing the\ncitizens without fee or reward\u2014this was his mission. Whether his\ndisciples have turned out well or ill, he cannot justly be charged with the\nresult, for he never promised to teach them anything. They might come if they\nliked, and they might stay away if they liked: and they did come, because they\nfound an amusement in hearing the pretenders to wisdom detected. If they have\nbeen corrupted, their elder relatives (if not themselves) might surely come\ninto court and witness against him, and there is an opportunity still for them\nto appear. But their fathers and brothers all appear in court (including\n\u201cthis\u201d Plato), to witness on his behalf; and if their relatives are\ncorrupted, at least they are uncorrupted; \u201cand they are my witnesses. For\nthey know that I am speaking the truth, and that Meletus is lying.\u201d\n</p><p>\nThis is about all that he has to say. He will not entreat the judges to spare\nhis life; neither will he present a spectacle of weeping children, although he,\ntoo, is not made of \u201crock or oak.\u201d Some of the judges themselves\nmay have complied with this practice on similar occasions, and he trusts that\nthey will not be angry with him for not following their example. But he feels\nthat such conduct brings discredit on the name of Athens: he feels too, that\nthe judge has sworn not to give away justice; and he cannot be guilty of the\nimpiety of asking the judge to break his oath, when he is himself being tried\nfor impiety.\n</p><p>\nAs he expected, and probably intended, he is convicted. And now the tone of the\nspeech, instead of being more conciliatory, becomes more lofty and commanding.\nAnytus proposes death as the penalty: and what counter-proposition shall he\nmake? He, the benefactor of the Athenian people, whose whole life has been\nspent in doing them good, should at least have the Olympic victor\u2019s\nreward of maintenance in the Prytaneum. Or why should he propose any\ncounter-penalty when he does not know whether death, which Anytus proposes, is\na good or an evil? And he is certain that imprisonment is an evil, exile is an\nevil. Loss of money might be an evil, but then he has none to give; perhaps he\ncan make up a mina. Let that be the penalty, or, if his friends wish, thirty\nmin\u00e6; for which they will be excellent securities.\n</p><p class=\"center\">\n[<i>He is condemned to death.</i>]\n</p><i>He is condemned to death.</i><p>\nHe is an old man already, and the Athenians will gain nothing but disgrace by\ndepriving him of a few years of life. Perhaps he could have escaped, if he had\nchosen to throw down his arms and entreat for his life. But he does not at all\nrepent of the manner of his defence; he would rather die in his own fashion\nthan live in theirs. For the penalty of unrighteousness is swifter than death;\nthat penalty has already overtaken his accusers as death will soon overtake\nhim.\n</p><p>\nAnd now, as one who is about to die, he will prophesy to them. They have put\nhim to death in order to escape the necessity of giving an account of their\nlives. But his death \u201cwill be the seed\u201d of many disciples who will\nconvince them of their evil ways, and will come forth to reprove them in\nharsher terms, because they are younger and more inconsiderate.\n</p><p>\nHe would like to say a few words, while there is time, to those who would have\nacquitted him. He wishes them to know that the divine sign never interrupted\nhim in the course of his defence; the reason of which, as he conjectures, is\nthat the death to which he is going is a good and not an evil. For either death\nis a long sleep, the best of sleeps, or a journey to another world in which the\nsouls of the dead are gathered together, and in which there may be a hope of\nseeing the heroes of old\u2014in which, too, there are just judges; and as all\nare immortal, there can be no fear of any one suffering death for his opinions.\n</p><p>\nNothing evil can happen to the good man either in life or death, and his own\ndeath has been permitted by the gods, because it was better for him to depart;\nand therefore he forgives his judges because they have done him no harm,\nalthough they never meant to do him any good.\n</p><p>\nHe has a last request to make to them\u2014that they will trouble his sons as\nhe has troubled them, if they appear to prefer riches to virtue, or to think\nthemselves something when they are nothing.\n</p><hr/><p>\n\u201cFew persons will be found to wish that Socrates should have defended\nhimself otherwise,\u201d\u2014if, as we must add, his defence was that with\nwhich Plato has provided him. But leaving this question, which does not admit\nof a precise solution, we may go on to ask what was the impression which Plato\nin the \u201cApology\u201d intended to give of the character and conduct of\nhis master in the last great scene? Did he intend to represent him (1) as\nemploying sophistries; (2) as designedly irritating the judges? Or are these\nsophistries to be regarded as belonging to the age in which he lived and to his\npersonal character, and this apparent haughtiness as flowing from the natural\nelevation of his position?\n</p><p>\nFor example, when he says that it is absurd to suppose that one man is the\ncorrupter and all the rest of the world the improvers of the youth; or, when he\nargues that he never could have corrupted the men with whom he had to live; or,\nwhen he proves his belief in the gods because he believes in the sons of gods,\nis he serious or jesting? It may be observed that these sophisms all occur in\nhis cross-examination of Meletus, who is easily foiled and mastered in the\nhands of the great dialectician. Perhaps he regarded these answers as good\nenough for his accuser, of whom he makes very light. Also there is a touch of\nirony in them, which takes them out of the category of sophistry. (Compare\nEuthyph.)\n</p><p>\nThat the manner in which he defends himself about the lives of his disciples is\nnot satisfactory, can hardly be denied. Fresh in the memory of the Athenians,\nand detestable as they deserved to be to the newly restored democracy, were the\nnames of Alcibiades, Critias, Charmides. It is obviously not a sufficient\nanswer that Socrates had never professed to teach them anything, and is\ntherefore not justly chargeable with their crimes. Yet the defence, when taken\nout of this ironical form, is doubtless sound: that his teaching had nothing to\ndo with their evil lives. Here, then, the sophistry is rather in form than in\nsubstance, though we might desire that to such a serious charge Socrates had\ngiven a more serious answer.\n</p><p>\nTruly characteristic of Socrates is another point in his answer, which may also\nbe regarded as sophistical. He says that \u201cif he has corrupted the youth,\nhe must have corrupted them involuntarily.\u201d But if, as Socrates argues,\nall evil is involuntary, then all criminals ought to be admonished and not\npunished. In these words the Socratic doctrine of the involuntariness of evil\nis clearly intended to be conveyed. Here again, as in the former instance, the\ndefence of Socrates is untrue practically, but may be true in some ideal or\ntranscendental sense. The commonplace reply, that if he had been guilty of\ncorrupting the youth their relations would surely have witnessed against him,\nwith which he concludes this part of his defence, is more satisfactory.\n</p><p>\nAgain, when Socrates argues that he must believe in the gods because he\nbelieves in the sons of gods, we must remember that this is a refutation not of\nthe original indictment, which is consistent enough\u2014\u201cSocrates does\nnot receive the gods whom the city receives, and has other new\ndivinities\u201d\u2014but of the interpretation put upon the words by\nMeletus, who has affirmed that he is a downright atheist. To this Socrates\nfairly answers, in accordance with the ideas of the time, that a downright\natheist cannot believe in the sons of gods or in divine things. The notion that\ndemons or lesser divinities are the sons of gods is not to be regarded as\nironical or sceptical. He is arguing \u201cad hominem\u201d according to the\nnotions of mythology current in his age. Yet he abstains from saying that he\nbelieved in the gods whom the State approved. He does not defend himself, as\nXenophon has defended him, by appealing to his practice of religion. Probably\nhe neither wholly believed, nor disbelieved, in the existence of the popular\ngods; he had no means of knowing about them. According to Plato (compare Ph\u00e6do;\nSymp.), as well as Xenophon (Memor.), he was punctual in the performance of the\nleast religious duties; and he must have believed in his own oracular sign, of\nwhich he seemed to have an internal witness. But the existence of Apollo or\nZeus, or the other gods whom the State approves, would have appeared to him\nboth uncertain and unimportant in comparison of the duty of self-examination,\nand of those principles of truth and right which he deemed to be the foundation\nof religion. (Compare Phaedr.; Euthyph.; Republic.)\n</p><p>\nThe second question, whether Plato meant to represent Socrates as braving or\nirritating his judges, must also be answered in the negative. His irony, his\nsuperiority, his audacity, \u201cregarding not the person of man,\u201d\nnecessarily flow out of the loftiness of his situation. He is not acting a part\nupon a great occasion, but he is what he has been all his life long, \u201ca\nking of men.\u201d He would rather not appear insolent, if he could avoid it\n(ouch os authadizomenos touto lego). Neither is he desirous of hastening his\nown end, for life and death are simply indifferent to him. But such a defence\nas would be acceptable to his judges and might procure an acquittal, it is not\nin his nature to make. He will not say or do anything that might pervert the\ncourse of justice; he cannot have his tongue bound even \u201cin the throat of\ndeath.\u201d With his accusers he will only fence and play, as he had fenced\nwith other \u201cimprovers of youth,\u201d answering the Sophist according to\nhis sophistry all his life long. He is serious when he is speaking of his own\nmission, which seems to distinguish him from all other reformers of mankind,\nand originates in an accident. The dedication of himself to the improvement of\nhis fellow-citizens is not so remarkable as the ironical spirit in which he\ngoes about doing good only in vindication of the credit of the oracle, and in\nthe vain hope of finding a wiser man than himself. Yet this singular and almost\naccidental character of his mission agrees with the divine sign which,\naccording to our notions, is equally accidental and irrational, and is\nnevertheless accepted by him as the guiding principle of his life. Socrates is\nnowhere represented to us as a freethinker or sceptic. There is no reason to\ndoubt his sincerity when he speculates on the possibility of seeing and knowing\nthe heroes of the Trojan war in another world. On the other hand, his hope of\nimmortality is uncertain;\u2014he also conceives of death as a long sleep (in\nthis respect differing from the Ph\u00e6do), and at last falls back on resignation\nto the divine will, and the certainty that no evil can happen to the good man\neither in life or death. His absolute truthfulness seems to hinder him from\nasserting positively more than this; and he makes no attempt to veil his\nignorance in mythology and figures of speech. The gentleness of the first part\nof the speech contrasts with the aggravated, almost threatening, tone of the\nconclusion. He characteristically remarks that he will not speak as a\nrhetorician, that is to say, he will not make a regular defence such as Lysias\nor one of the orators might have composed for him, or, according to some\naccounts, did compose for him. But he first procures himself a hearing by\nconciliatory words. He does not attack the Sophists; for they were open to the\nsame charges as himself; they were equally ridiculed by the Comic poets, and\nalmost equally hateful to Anytus and Meletus. Yet incidentally the antagonism\nbetween Socrates and the Sophists is allowed to appear. He is poor and they are\nrich; his profession that he teaches nothing is opposed to their readiness to\nteach all things; his talking in the marketplace to their private instructions;\nhis tarry-at-home life to their wandering from city to city. The tone which he\nassumes towards them is one of real friendliness, but also of concealed irony.\nTowards Anaxagoras, who had disappointed him in his hopes of learning about\nmind and nature, he shows a less kindly feeling, which is also the feeling of\nPlato in other passages (Laws). But Anaxagoras had been dead thirty years, and\nwas beyond the reach of persecution.\n</p><p>\nIt has been remarked that the prophecy of a new generation of teachers who\nwould rebuke and exhort the Athenian people in harsher and more violent terms\nwas, as far as we know, never fulfilled. No inference can be drawn from this\ncircumstance as to the probability of the words attributed to him having been\nactually uttered. They express the aspiration of the first martyr of\nphilosophy, that he would leave behind him many followers, accompanied by the\nnot unnatural feeling that they would be fiercer and more inconsiderate in\ntheir words when emancipated from his control.\n</p><p>\nThe above remarks must be understood as applying with any degree of certainty\nto the Platonic Socrates only. For, although these or similar words may have\nbeen spoken by Socrates himself, we cannot exclude the possibility, that like\nso much else, <i>e.g.</i> the wisdom of Critias, the poem of Solon, the virtues\nof Charmides, they may have been due only to the imagination of Plato. The\narguments of those who maintain that the Apology was composed during the\nprocess, resting on no evidence, do not require a serious refutation. Nor are\nthe reasonings of Schleiermacher, who argues that the Platonic defence is an\nexact or nearly exact reproduction of the words of Socrates, partly because\nPlato would not have been guilty of the impiety of altering them, and also\nbecause many points of the defence might have been improved and strengthened,\nat all more conclusive. (See English Translation.) What effect the death of\nSocrates produced on the mind of Plato, we cannot certainly determine; nor can\nwe say how he would or must have written under the circumstances. We observe\nthat the enmity of Aristophanes to Socrates does not prevent Plato from\nintroducing them together in the Symposium engaged in friendly intercourse. Nor\nis there any trace in the Dialogues of an attempt to make Anytus or Meletus\npersonally odious in the eyes of the Athenian public.\n</p><i>e.g.</i><p><!--end chapter-->\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\n<h2><a id=\"chap02\"></a>APOLOGY</h2>\n<p>\nHow you, O Athenians, have been affected by my accusers, I cannot tell; but I\nknow that they almost made me forget who I was\u2014so persuasively did they\nspeak; and yet they have hardly uttered a word of truth. But of the many\nfalsehoods told by them, there was one which quite amazed me;\u2014I mean when\nthey said that you should be upon your guard and not allow yourselves to be\ndeceived by the force of my eloquence. To say this, when they were certain to\nbe detected as soon as I opened my lips and proved myself to be anything but a\ngreat speaker, did indeed appear to me most shameless\u2014unless by the force\nof eloquence they mean the force of truth; for if such is their meaning, I\nadmit that I am eloquent. But in how different a way from theirs! Well, as I\nwas saying, they have scarcely spoken the truth at all; but from me you shall\nhear the whole truth: not, however, delivered after their manner in a set\noration duly ornamented with words and phrases. No, by heaven! but I shall use\nthe words and arguments which occur to me at the moment; for I am confident in\nthe justice of my cause (Or, I am certain that I am right in taking this\ncourse.): at my time of life I ought not to be appearing before you, O men of\nAthens, in the character of a juvenile orator\u2014let no one expect it of me.\nAnd I must beg of you to grant me a favour:\u2014If I defend myself in my\naccustomed manner, and you hear me using the words which I have been in the\nhabit of using in the agora, at the tables of the money-changers, or anywhere\nelse, I would ask you not to be surprised, and not to interrupt me on this\naccount. For I am more than seventy years of age, and appearing now for the\nfirst time in a court of law, I am quite a stranger to the language of the\nplace; and therefore I would have you regard me as if I were really a stranger,\nwhom you would excuse if he spoke in his native tongue, and after the fashion\nof his country:\u2014Am I making an unfair request of you? Never mind the\nmanner, which may or may not be good; but think only of the truth of my words,\nand give heed to that: let the speaker speak truly and the judge decide justly.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd first, I have to reply to the older charges and to my first accusers, and\nthen I will go on to the later ones. For of old I have had many accusers, who\nhave accused me falsely to you during many years; and I am more afraid of them\nthan of Anytus and his associates, who are dangerous, too, in their own way.\nBut far more dangerous are the others, who began when you were children, and\ntook possession of your minds with their falsehoods, telling of one Socrates, a\nwise man, who speculated about the heaven above, and searched into the earth\nbeneath, and made the worse appear the better cause. The disseminators of this\ntale are the accusers whom I dread; for their hearers are apt to fancy that\nsuch enquirers do not believe in the existence of the gods. And they are many,\nand their charges against me are of ancient date, and they were made by them in\nthe days when you were more impressible than you are now\u2014in childhood, or\nit may have been in youth\u2014and the cause when heard went by default, for\nthere was none to answer. And hardest of all, I do not know and cannot tell the\nnames of my accusers; unless in the chance case of a Comic poet. All who from\nenvy and malice have persuaded you\u2014some of them having first convinced\nthemselves\u2014all this class of men are most difficult to deal with; for I\ncannot have them up here, and cross-examine them, and therefore I must simply\nfight with shadows in my own defence, and argue when there is no one who\nanswers. I will ask you then to assume with me, as I was saying, that my\nopponents are of two kinds; one recent, the other ancient: and I hope that you\nwill see the propriety of my answering the latter first, for these accusations\nyou heard long before the others, and much oftener.\n</p>\n<p>\nWell, then, I must make my defence, and endeavour to clear away in a short\ntime, a slander which has lasted a long time. May I succeed, if to succeed be\nfor my good and yours, or likely to avail me in my cause! The task is not an\neasy one; I quite understand the nature of it. And so leaving the event with\nGod, in obedience to the law I will now make my defence.\n</p>\n<p>\nI will begin at the beginning, and ask what is the accusation which has given\nrise to the slander of me, and in fact has encouraged Meletus to proof this\ncharge against me. Well, what do the slanderers say? They shall be my\nprosecutors, and I will sum up their words in an affidavit: \u201cSocrates is\nan evil-doer, and a curious person, who searches into things under the earth\nand in heaven, and he makes the worse appear the better cause; and he teaches\nthe aforesaid doctrines to others.\u201d Such is the nature of the accusation:\nit is just what you have yourselves seen in the comedy of Aristophanes\n(Aristoph., Clouds.), who has introduced a man whom he calls Socrates, going\nabout and saying that he walks in air, and talking a deal of nonsense\nconcerning matters of which I do not pretend to know either much or\nlittle\u2014not that I mean to speak disparagingly of any one who is a student\nof natural philosophy. I should be very sorry if Meletus could bring so grave a\ncharge against me. But the simple truth is, O Athenians, that I have nothing to\ndo with physical speculations. Very many of those here present are witnesses to\nthe truth of this, and to them I appeal. Speak then, you who have heard me, and\ntell your neighbours whether any of you have ever known me hold forth in few\nwords or in many upon such matters...You hear their answer. And from what they\nsay of this part of the charge you will be able to judge of the truth of the\nrest.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs little foundation is there for the report that I am a teacher, and take\nmoney; this accusation has no more truth in it than the other. Although, if a\nman were really able to instruct mankind, to receive money for giving\ninstruction would, in my opinion, be an honour to him. There is Gorgias of\nLeontium, and Prodicus of Ceos, and Hippias of Elis, who go the round of the\ncities, and are able to persuade the young men to leave their own citizens by\nwhom they might be taught for nothing, and come to them whom they not only pay,\nbut are thankful if they may be allowed to pay them. There is at this time a\nParian philosopher residing in Athens, of whom I have heard; and I came to hear\nof him in this way:\u2014I came across a man who has spent a world of money on\nthe Sophists, Callias, the son of Hipponicus, and knowing that he had sons, I\nasked him: \u201cCallias,\u201d I said, \u201cif your two sons were foals or\ncalves, there would be no difficulty in finding some one to put over them; we\nshould hire a trainer of horses, or a farmer probably, who would improve and\nperfect them in their own proper virtue and excellence; but as they are human\nbeings, whom are you thinking of placing over them? Is there any one who\nunderstands human and political virtue? You must have thought about the matter,\nfor you have sons; is there any one?\u201d \u201cThere is,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWho is he?\u201d said I; \u201cand of what country? and what does he\ncharge?\u201d \u201cEvenus the Parian,\u201d he replied; \u201che is the\nman, and his charge is five min\u00e6.\u201d Happy is Evenus, I said to myself, if\nhe really has this wisdom, and teaches at such a moderate charge. Had I the\nsame, I should have been very proud and conceited; but the truth is that I have\nno knowledge of the kind.\n</p>\n<p>\nI dare say, Athenians, that some one among you will reply, \u201cYes,\nSocrates, but what is the origin of these accusations which are brought against\nyou; there must have been something strange which you have been doing? All\nthese rumours and this talk about you would never have arisen if you had been\nlike other men: tell us, then, what is the cause of them, for we should be\nsorry to judge hastily of you.\u201d Now I regard this as a fair challenge,\nand I will endeavour to explain to you the reason why I am called wise and have\nsuch an evil fame. Please to attend then. And although some of you may think\nthat I am joking, I declare that I will tell you the entire truth. Men of\nAthens, this reputation of mine has come of a certain sort of wisdom which I\npossess. If you ask me what kind of wisdom, I reply, wisdom such as may perhaps\nbe attained by man, for to that extent I am inclined to believe that I am wise;\nwhereas the persons of whom I was speaking have a superhuman wisdom which I may\nfail to describe, because I have it not myself; and he who says that I have,\nspeaks falsely, and is taking away my character. And here, O men of Athens, I\nmust beg you not to interrupt me, even if I seem to say something extravagant.\nFor the word which I will speak is not mine. I will refer you to a witness who\nis worthy of credit; that witness shall be the God of Delphi\u2014he will tell\nyou about my wisdom, if I have any, and of what sort it is. You must have known\nChaerephon; he was early a friend of mine, and also a friend of yours, for he\nshared in the recent exile of the people, and returned with you. Well,\nChaerephon, as you know, was very impetuous in all his doings, and he went to\nDelphi and boldly asked the oracle to tell him whether\u2014as I was saying, I\nmust beg you not to interrupt\u2014he asked the oracle to tell him whether\nanyone was wiser than I was, and the Pythian prophetess answered, that there\nwas no man wiser. Chaerephon is dead himself; but his brother, who is in court,\nwill confirm the truth of what I am saying.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhy do I mention this? Because I am going to explain to you why I have such an\nevil name. When I heard the answer, I said to myself, What can the god mean?\nand what is the interpretation of his riddle? for I know that I have no wisdom,\nsmall or great. What then can he mean when he says that I am the wisest of men?\nAnd yet he is a god, and cannot lie; that would be against his nature. After\nlong consideration, I thought of a method of trying the question. I reflected\nthat if I could only find a man wiser than myself, then I might go to the god\nwith a refutation in my hand. I should say to him, \u201cHere is a man who is\nwiser than I am; but you said that I was the wisest.\u201d Accordingly I went\nto one who had the reputation of wisdom, and observed him\u2014his name I need\nnot mention; he was a politician whom I selected for examination\u2014and the\nresult was as follows: When I began to talk with him, I could not help thinking\nthat he was not really wise, although he was thought wise by many, and still\nwiser by himself; and thereupon I tried to explain to him that he thought\nhimself wise, but was not really wise; and the consequence was that he hated\nme, and his enmity was shared by several who were present and heard me. So I\nleft him, saying to myself, as I went away: Well, although I do not suppose\nthat either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am better off\nthan he is,\u2014for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows; I neither\nknow nor think that I know. In this latter particular, then, I seem to have\nslightly the advantage of him. Then I went to another who had still higher\npretensions to wisdom, and my conclusion was exactly the same. Whereupon I made\nanother enemy of him, and of many others besides him.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen I went to one man after another, being not unconscious of the enmity which\nI provoked, and I lamented and feared this: but necessity was laid upon\nme,\u2014the word of God, I thought, ought to be considered first. And I said\nto myself, Go I must to all who appear to know, and find out the meaning of the\noracle. And I swear to you, Athenians, by the dog I swear!\u2014for I must\ntell you the truth\u2014the result of my mission was just this: I found that\nthe men most in repute were all but the most foolish; and that others less\nesteemed were really wiser and better. I will tell you the tale of my\nwanderings and of the \u201cHerculean\u201d labours, as I may call them,\nwhich I endured only to find at last the oracle irrefutable. After the\npoliticians, I went to the poets; tragic, dithyrambic, and all sorts. And\nthere, I said to myself, you will be instantly detected; now you will find out\nthat you are more ignorant than they are. Accordingly, I took them some of the\nmost elaborate passages in their own writings, and asked what was the meaning\nof them\u2014thinking that they would teach me something. Will you believe me?\nI am almost ashamed to confess the truth, but I must say that there is hardly a\nperson present who would not have talked better about their poetry than they\ndid themselves. Then I knew that not by wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a\nsort of genius and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also\nsay many fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them. The poets\nappeared to me to be much in the same case; and I further observed that upon\nthe strength of their poetry they believed themselves to be the wisest of men\nin other things in which they were not wise. So I departed, conceiving myself\nto be superior to them for the same reason that I was superior to the\npoliticians.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt last I went to the artisans. I was conscious that I knew nothing at all, as\nI may say, and I was sure that they knew many fine things; and here I was not\nmistaken, for they did know many things of which I was ignorant, and in this\nthey certainly were wiser than I was. But I observed that even the good\nartisans fell into the same error as the poets;\u2014because they were good\nworkmen they thought that they also knew all sorts of high matters, and this\ndefect in them overshadowed their wisdom; and therefore I asked myself on\nbehalf of the oracle, whether I would like to be as I was, neither having their\nknowledge nor their ignorance, or like them in both; and I made answer to\nmyself and to the oracle that I was better off as I was.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis inquisition has led to my having many enemies of the worst and most\ndangerous kind, and has given occasion also to many calumnies. And I am called\nwise, for my hearers always imagine that I myself possess the wisdom which I\nfind wanting in others: but the truth is, O men of Athens, that God only is\nwise; and by his answer he intends to show that the wisdom of men is worth\nlittle or nothing; he is not speaking of Socrates, he is only using my name by\nway of illustration, as if he said, He, O men, is the wisest, who, like\nSocrates, knows that his wisdom is in truth worth nothing. And so I go about\nthe world, obedient to the god, and search and make enquiry into the wisdom of\nany one, whether citizen or stranger, who appears to be wise; and if he is not\nwise, then in vindication of the oracle I show him that he is not wise; and my\noccupation quite absorbs me, and I have no time to give either to any public\nmatter of interest or to any concern of my own, but I am in utter poverty by\nreason of my devotion to the god.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere is another thing:\u2014young men of the richer classes, who have not\nmuch to do, come about me of their own accord; they like to hear the pretenders\nexamined, and they often imitate me, and proceed to examine others; there are\nplenty of persons, as they quickly discover, who think that they know\nsomething, but really know little or nothing; and then those who are examined\nby them instead of being angry with themselves are angry with me: This\nconfounded Socrates, they say; this villainous misleader of youth!\u2014and\nthen if somebody asks them, Why, what evil does he practise or teach? they do\nnot know, and cannot tell; but in order that they may not appear to be at a\nloss, they repeat the ready-made charges which are used against all\nphilosophers about teaching things up in the clouds and under the earth, and\nhaving no gods, and making the worse appear the better cause; for they do not\nlike to confess that their pretence of knowledge has been detected\u2014which\nis the truth; and as they are numerous and ambitious and energetic, and are\ndrawn up in battle array and have persuasive tongues, they have filled your\nears with their loud and inveterate calumnies. And this is the reason why my\nthree accusers, Meletus and Anytus and Lycon, have set upon me; Meletus, who\nhas a quarrel with me on behalf of the poets; Anytus, on behalf of the\ncraftsmen and politicians; Lycon, on behalf of the rhetoricians: and as I said\nat the beginning, I cannot expect to get rid of such a mass of calumny all in a\nmoment. And this, O men of Athens, is the truth and the whole truth; I have\nconcealed nothing, I have dissembled nothing. And yet, I know that my plainness\nof speech makes them hate me, and what is their hatred but a proof that I am\nspeaking the truth?\u2014Hence has arisen the prejudice against me; and this\nis the reason of it, as you will find out either in this or in any future\nenquiry.\n</p>\n<p>\nI have said enough in my defence against the first class of my accusers; I turn\nto the second class. They are headed by Meletus, that good man and true lover\nof his country, as he calls himself. Against these, too, I must try to make a\ndefence:\u2014Let their affidavit be read: it contains something of this kind:\nIt says that Socrates is a doer of evil, who corrupts the youth; and who does\nnot believe in the gods of the state, but has other new divinities of his own.\nSuch is the charge; and now let us examine the particular counts. He says that\nI am a doer of evil, and corrupt the youth; but I say, O men of Athens, that\nMeletus is a doer of evil, in that he pretends to be in earnest when he is only\nin jest, and is so eager to bring men to trial from a pretended zeal and\ninterest about matters in which he really never had the smallest interest. And\nthe truth of this I will endeavour to prove to you.\n</p>\n<p>\nCome hither, Meletus, and let me ask a question of you. You think a great deal\nabout the improvement of youth?\n</p>\n<p>\nYes, I do.\n</p>\n<p>\nTell the judges, then, who is their improver; for you must know, as you have\ntaken the pains to discover their corrupter, and are citing and accusing me\nbefore them. Speak, then, and tell the judges who their improver\nis.\u2014Observe, Meletus, that you are silent, and have nothing to say. But\nis not this rather disgraceful, and a very considerable proof of what I was\nsaying, that you have no interest in the matter? Speak up, friend, and tell us\nwho their improver is.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe laws.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut that, my good sir, is not my meaning. I want to know who the person is,\nwho, in the first place, knows the laws.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe judges, Socrates, who are present in court.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat, do you mean to say, Meletus, that they are able to instruct and improve\nyouth?\n</p>\n<p>\nCertainly they are.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat, all of them, or some only and not others?\n</p>\n<p>\nAll of them.\n</p>\n<p>\nBy the goddess Here, that is good news! There are plenty of improvers, then.\nAnd what do you say of the audience,\u2014do they improve them?\n</p>\n<p>\nYes, they do.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd the senators?\n</p>\n<p>\nYes, the senators improve them.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut perhaps the members of the assembly corrupt them?\u2014or do they too\nimprove them?\n</p>\n<p>\nThey improve them.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen every Athenian improves and elevates them; all with the exception of\nmyself; and I alone am their corrupter? Is that what you affirm?\n</p>\n<p>\nThat is what I stoutly affirm.\n</p>\n<p>\nI am very unfortunate if you are right. But suppose I ask you a question: How\nabout horses? Does one man do them harm and all the world good? Is not the\nexact opposite the truth? One man is able to do them good, or at least not\nmany;\u2014the trainer of horses, that is to say, does them good, and others\nwho have to do with them rather injure them? Is not that true, Meletus, of\nhorses, or of any other animals? Most assuredly it is; whether you and Anytus\nsay yes or no. Happy indeed would be the condition of youth if they had one\ncorrupter only, and all the rest of the world were their improvers. But you,\nMeletus, have sufficiently shown that you never had a thought about the young:\nyour carelessness is seen in your not caring about the very things which you\nbring against me.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd now, Meletus, I will ask you another question\u2014by Zeus I will: Which\nis better, to live among bad citizens, or among good ones? Answer, friend, I\nsay; the question is one which may be easily answered. Do not the good do their\nneighbours good, and the bad do them evil?\n</p>\n<p>\nCertainly.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd is there anyone who would rather be injured than benefited by those who\nlive with him? Answer, my good friend, the law requires you to\nanswer\u2014does any one like to be injured?\n</p>\n<p>\nCertainly not.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd when you accuse me of corrupting and deteriorating the youth, do you allege\nthat I corrupt them intentionally or unintentionally?\n</p>\n<p>\nIntentionally, I say.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut you have just admitted that the good do their neighbours good, and the evil\ndo them evil. Now, is that a truth which your superior wisdom has recognized\nthus early in life, and am I, at my age, in such darkness and ignorance as not\nto know that if a man with whom I have to live is corrupted by me, I am very\nlikely to be harmed by him; and yet I corrupt him, and intentionally,\ntoo\u2014so you say, although neither I nor any other human being is ever\nlikely to be convinced by you. But either I do not corrupt them, or I corrupt\nthem unintentionally; and on either view of the case you lie. If my offence is\nunintentional, the law has no cognizance of unintentional offences: you ought\nto have taken me privately, and warned and admonished me; for if I had been\nbetter advised, I should have left off doing what I only did\nunintentionally\u2014no doubt I should; but you would have nothing to say to\nme and refused to teach me. And now you bring me up in this court, which is a\nplace not of instruction, but of punishment.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt will be very clear to you, Athenians, as I was saying, that Meletus has no\ncare at all, great or small, about the matter. But still I should like to know,\nMeletus, in what I am affirmed to corrupt the young. I suppose you mean, as I\ninfer from your indictment, that I teach them not to acknowledge the gods which\nthe state acknowledges, but some other new divinities or spiritual agencies in\ntheir stead. These are the lessons by which I corrupt the youth, as you say.\n</p>\n<p>\nYes, that I say emphatically.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen, by the gods, Meletus, of whom we are speaking, tell me and the court, in\nsomewhat plainer terms, what you mean! for I do not as yet understand whether\nyou affirm that I teach other men to acknowledge some gods, and therefore that\nI do believe in gods, and am not an entire atheist\u2014this you do not lay to\nmy charge,\u2014but only you say that they are not the same gods which the\ncity recognizes\u2014the charge is that they are different gods. Or, do you\nmean that I am an atheist simply, and a teacher of atheism?\n</p>\n<p>\nI mean the latter\u2014that you are a complete atheist.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat an extraordinary statement! Why do you think so, Meletus? Do you mean that\nI do not believe in the godhead of the sun or moon, like other men?\n</p>\n<p>\nI assure you, judges, that he does not: for he says that the sun is stone, and\nthe moon earth.\n</p>\n<p>\nFriend Meletus, you think that you are accusing Anaxagoras: and you have but a\nbad opinion of the judges, if you fancy them illiterate to such a degree as not\nto know that these doctrines are found in the books of Anaxagoras the\nClazomenian, which are full of them. And so, forsooth, the youth are said to be\ntaught them by Socrates, when there are not unfrequently exhibitions of them at\nthe theatre (Probably in allusion to Aristophanes who caricatured, and to\nEuripides who borrowed the notions of Anaxagoras, as well as to other dramatic\npoets.) (price of admission one drachma at the most); and they might pay their\nmoney, and laugh at Socrates if he pretends to father these extraordinary\nviews. And so, Meletus, you really think that I do not believe in any god?\n</p>\n<p>\nI swear by Zeus that you believe absolutely in none at all.\n</p>\n<p>\nNobody will believe you, Meletus, and I am pretty sure that you do not believe\nyourself. I cannot help thinking, men of Athens, that Meletus is reckless and\nimpudent, and that he has written this indictment in a spirit of mere\nwantonness and youthful bravado. Has he not compounded a riddle, thinking to\ntry me? He said to himself:\u2014I shall see whether the wise Socrates will\ndiscover my facetious contradiction, or whether I shall be able to deceive him\nand the rest of them. For he certainly does appear to me to contradict himself\nin the indictment as much as if he said that Socrates is guilty of not\nbelieving in the gods, and yet of believing in them\u2014but this is not like\na person who is in earnest.\n</p>\n<p>\nI should like you, O men of Athens, to join me in examining what I conceive to\nbe his inconsistency; and do you, Meletus, answer. And I must remind the\naudience of my request that they would not make a disturbance if I speak in my\naccustomed manner:\n</p>\n<p>\nDid ever man, Meletus, believe in the existence of human things, and not of\nhuman beings?...I wish, men of Athens, that he would answer, and not be always\ntrying to get up an interruption. Did ever any man believe in horsemanship, and\nnot in horses? or in flute-playing, and not in flute-players? No, my friend; I\nwill answer to you and to the court, as you refuse to answer for yourself.\nThere is no man who ever did. But now please to answer the next question: Can a\nman believe in spiritual and divine agencies, and not in spirits or demigods?\n</p>\n<p>\nHe cannot.\n</p>\n<p>\nHow lucky I am to have extracted that answer, by the assistance of the court!\nBut then you swear in the indictment that I teach and believe in divine or\nspiritual agencies (new or old, no matter for that); at any rate, I believe in\nspiritual agencies,\u2014so you say and swear in the affidavit; and yet if I\nbelieve in divine beings, how can I help believing in spirits or\ndemigods;\u2014must I not? To be sure I must; and therefore I may assume that\nyour silence gives consent. Now what are spirits or demigods? Are they not\neither gods or the sons of gods?\n</p>\n<p>\nCertainly they are.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut this is what I call the facetious riddle invented by you: the demigods or\nspirits are gods, and you say first that I do not believe in gods, and then\nagain that I do believe in gods; that is, if I believe in demigods. For if the\ndemigods are the illegitimate sons of gods, whether by the nymphs or by any\nother mothers, of whom they are said to be the sons\u2014what human being will\never believe that there are no gods if they are the sons of gods? You might as\nwell affirm the existence of mules, and deny that of horses and asses. Such\nnonsense, Meletus, could only have been intended by you to make trial of me.\nYou have put this into the indictment because you had nothing real of which to\naccuse me. But no one who has a particle of understanding will ever be\nconvinced by you that the same men can believe in divine and superhuman things,\nand yet not believe that there are gods and demigods and heroes.\n</p>\n<p>\nI have said enough in answer to the charge of Meletus: any elaborate defence is\nunnecessary, but I know only too well how many are the enmities which I have\nincurred, and this is what will be my destruction if I am destroyed;\u2014not\nMeletus, nor yet Anytus, but the envy and detraction of the world, which has\nbeen the death of many good men, and will probably be the death of many more;\nthere is no danger of my being the last of them.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome one will say: And are you not ashamed, Socrates, of a course of life which\nis likely to bring you to an untimely end? To him I may fairly answer: There\nyou are mistaken: a man who is good for anything ought not to calculate the\nchance of living or dying; he ought only to consider whether in doing anything\nhe is doing right or wrong\u2014acting the part of a good man or of a bad.\nWhereas, upon your view, the heroes who fell at Troy were not good for much,\nand the son of Thetis above all, who altogether despised danger in comparison\nwith disgrace; and when he was so eager to slay Hector, his goddess mother said\nto him, that if he avenged his companion Patroclus, and slew Hector, he would\ndie himself\u2014\u201cFate,\u201d she said, in these or the like words,\n\u201cwaits for you next after Hector;\u201d he, receiving this warning,\nutterly despised danger and death, and instead of fearing them, feared rather\nto live in dishonour, and not to avenge his friend. \u201cLet me die\nforthwith,\u201d he replies, \u201cand be avenged of my enemy, rather than\nabide here by the beaked ships, a laughing-stock and a burden of the\nearth.\u201d Had Achilles any thought of death and danger? For wherever a\nman\u2019s place is, whether the place which he has chosen or that in which he\nhas been placed by a commander, there he ought to remain in the hour of danger;\nhe should not think of death or of anything but of disgrace. And this, O men of\nAthens, is a true saying.\n</p>\n<p>\nStrange, indeed, would be my conduct, O men of Athens, if I who, when I was\nordered by the generals whom you chose to command me at Potidaea and Amphipolis\nand Delium, remained where they placed me, like any other man, facing\ndeath\u2014if now, when, as I conceive and imagine, God orders me to fulfil\nthe philosopher\u2019s mission of searching into myself and other men, I were\nto desert my post through fear of death, or any other fear; that would indeed\nbe strange, and I might justly be arraigned in court for denying the existence\nof the gods, if I disobeyed the oracle because I was afraid of death, fancying\nthat I was wise when I was not wise. For the fear of death is indeed the\npretence of wisdom, and not real wisdom, being a pretence of knowing the\nunknown; and no one knows whether death, which men in their fear apprehend to\nbe the greatest evil, may not be the greatest good. Is not this ignorance of a\ndisgraceful sort, the ignorance which is the conceit that a man knows what he\ndoes not know? And in this respect only I believe myself to differ from men in\ngeneral, and may perhaps claim to be wiser than they are:\u2014that whereas I\nknow but little of the world below, I do not suppose that I know: but I do know\nthat injustice and disobedience to a better, whether God or man, is evil and\ndishonourable, and I will never fear or avoid a possible good rather than a\ncertain evil. And therefore if you let me go now, and are not convinced by\nAnytus, who said that since I had been prosecuted I must be put to death; (or\nif not that I ought never to have been prosecuted at all); and that if I escape\nnow, your sons will all be utterly ruined by listening to my words\u2014if you\nsay to me, Socrates, this time we will not mind Anytus, and you shall be let\noff, but upon one condition, that you are not to enquire and speculate in this\nway any more, and that if you are caught doing so again you shall die;\u2014if\nthis was the condition on which you let me go, I should reply: Men of Athens, I\nhonour and love you; but I shall obey God rather than you, and while I have\nlife and strength I shall never cease from the practice and teaching of\nphilosophy, exhorting any one whom I meet and saying to him after my manner:\nYou, my friend,\u2014a citizen of the great and mighty and wise city of\nAthens,\u2014are you not ashamed of heaping up the greatest amount of money\nand honour and reputation, and caring so little about wisdom and truth and the\ngreatest improvement of the soul, which you never regard or heed at all? And if\nthe person with whom I am arguing, says: Yes, but I do care; then I do not\nleave him or let him go at once; but I proceed to interrogate and examine and\ncross-examine him, and if I think that he has no virtue in him, but only says\nthat he has, I reproach him with undervaluing the greater, and overvaluing the\nless. And I shall repeat the same words to every one whom I meet, young and\nold, citizen and alien, but especially to the citizens, inasmuch as they are my\nbrethren. For know that this is the command of God; and I believe that no\ngreater good has ever happened in the state than my service to the God. For I\ndo nothing but go about persuading you all, old and young alike, not to take\nthought for your persons or your properties, but first and chiefly to care\nabout the greatest improvement of the soul. I tell you that virtue is not given\nby money, but that from virtue comes money and every other good of man, public\nas well as private. This is my teaching, and if this is the doctrine which\ncorrupts the youth, I am a mischievous person. But if any one says that this is\nnot my teaching, he is speaking an untruth. Wherefore, O men of Athens, I say\nto you, do as Anytus bids or not as Anytus bids, and either acquit me or not;\nbut whichever you do, understand that I shall never alter my ways, not even if\nI have to die many times.\n</p>\n<p>\nMen of Athens, do not interrupt, but hear me; there was an understanding\nbetween us that you should hear me to the end: I have something more to say, at\nwhich you may be inclined to cry out; but I believe that to hear me will be\ngood for you, and therefore I beg that you will not cry out. I would have you\nknow, that if you kill such an one as I am, you will injure yourselves more\nthan you will injure me. Nothing will injure me, not Meletus nor yet\nAnytus\u2014they cannot, for a bad man is not permitted to injure a better\nthan himself. I do not deny that Anytus may, perhaps, kill him, or drive him\ninto exile, or deprive him of civil rights; and he may imagine, and others may\nimagine, that he is inflicting a great injury upon him: but there I do not\nagree. For the evil of doing as he is doing\u2014the evil of unjustly taking\naway the life of another\u2014is greater far.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd now, Athenians, I am not going to argue for my own sake, as you may think,\nbut for yours, that you may not sin against the God by condemning me, who am\nhis gift to you. For if you kill me you will not easily find a successor to me,\nwho, if I may use such a ludicrous figure of speech, am a sort of gadfly, given\nto the state by God; and the state is a great and noble steed who is tardy in\nhis motions owing to his very size, and requires to be stirred into life. I am\nthat gadfly which God has attached to the state, and all day long and in all\nplaces am always fastening upon you, arousing and persuading and reproaching\nyou. You will not easily find another like me, and therefore I would advise you\nto spare me. I dare say that you may feel out of temper (like a person who is\nsuddenly awakened from sleep), and you think that you might easily strike me\ndead as Anytus advises, and then you would sleep on for the remainder of your\nlives, unless God in his care of you sent you another gadfly. When I say that I\nam given to you by God, the proof of my mission is this:\u2014if I had been\nlike other men, I should not have neglected all my own concerns or patiently\nseen the neglect of them during all these years, and have been doing yours,\ncoming to you individually like a father or elder brother, exhorting you to\nregard virtue; such conduct, I say, would be unlike human nature. If I had\ngained anything, or if my exhortations had been paid, there would have been\nsome sense in my doing so; but now, as you will perceive, not even the\nimpudence of my accusers dares to say that I have ever exacted or sought pay of\nany one; of that they have no witness. And I have a sufficient witness to the\ntruth of what I say\u2014my poverty.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome one may wonder why I go about in private giving advice and busying myself\nwith the concerns of others, but do not venture to come forward in public and\nadvise the state. I will tell you why. You have heard me speak at sundry times\nand in divers places of an oracle or sign which comes to me, and is the\ndivinity which Meletus ridicules in the indictment. This sign, which is a kind\nof voice, first began to come to me when I was a child; it always forbids but\nnever commands me to do anything which I am going to do. This is what deters me\nfrom being a politician. And rightly, as I think. For I am certain, O men of\nAthens, that if I had engaged in politics, I should have perished long ago, and\ndone no good either to you or to myself. And do not be offended at my telling\nyou the truth: for the truth is, that no man who goes to war with you or any\nother multitude, honestly striving against the many lawless and unrighteous\ndeeds which are done in a state, will save his life; he who will fight for the\nright, if he would live even for a brief space, must have a private station and\nnot a public one.\n</p>\n<p>\nI can give you convincing evidence of what I say, not words only, but what you\nvalue far more\u2014actions. Let me relate to you a passage of my own life\nwhich will prove to you that I should never have yielded to injustice from any\nfear of death, and that \u201cas I should have refused to yield\u201d I must\nhave died at once. I will tell you a tale of the courts, not very interesting\nperhaps, but nevertheless true. The only office of state which I ever held, O\nmen of Athens, was that of senator: the tribe Antiochis, which is my tribe, had\nthe presidency at the trial of the generals who had not taken up the bodies of\nthe slain after the battle of Arginusae; and you proposed to try them in a\nbody, contrary to law, as you all thought afterwards; but at the time I was the\nonly one of the Prytanes who was opposed to the illegality, and I gave my vote\nagainst you; and when the orators threatened to impeach and arrest me, and you\ncalled and shouted, I made up my mind that I would run the risk, having law and\njustice with me, rather than take part in your injustice because I feared\nimprisonment and death. This happened in the days of the democracy. But when\nthe oligarchy of the Thirty was in power, they sent for me and four others into\nthe rotunda, and bade us bring Leon the Salaminian from Salamis, as they wanted\nto put him to death. This was a specimen of the sort of commands which they\nwere always giving with the view of implicating as many as possible in their\ncrimes; and then I showed, not in word only but in deed, that, if I may be\nallowed to use such an expression, I cared not a straw for death, and that my\ngreat and only care was lest I should do an unrighteous or unholy thing. For\nthe strong arm of that oppressive power did not frighten me into doing wrong;\nand when we came out of the rotunda the other four went to Salamis and fetched\nLeon, but I went quietly home. For which I might have lost my life, had not the\npower of the Thirty shortly afterwards come to an end. And many will witness to\nmy words.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow do you really imagine that I could have survived all these years, if I had\nled a public life, supposing that like a good man I had always maintained the\nright and had made justice, as I ought, the first thing? No indeed, men of\nAthens, neither I nor any other man. But I have been always the same in all my\nactions, public as well as private, and never have I yielded any base\ncompliance to those who are slanderously termed my disciples, or to any other.\nNot that I have any regular disciples. But if any one likes to come and hear me\nwhile I am pursuing my mission, whether he be young or old, he is not excluded.\nNor do I converse only with those who pay; but any one, whether he be rich or\npoor, may ask and answer me and listen to my words; and whether he turns out to\nbe a bad man or a good one, neither result can be justly imputed to me; for I\nnever taught or professed to teach him anything. And if any one says that he\nhas ever learned or heard anything from me in private which all the world has\nnot heard, let me tell you that he is lying.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut I shall be asked, Why do people delight in continually conversing with you?\nI have told you already, Athenians, the whole truth about this matter: they\nlike to hear the cross-examination of the pretenders to wisdom; there is\namusement in it. Now this duty of cross-examining other men has been imposed\nupon me by God; and has been signified to me by oracles, visions, and in every\nway in which the will of divine power was ever intimated to any one. This is\ntrue, O Athenians, or, if not true, would be soon refuted. If I am or have been\ncorrupting the youth, those of them who are now grown up and have become\nsensible that I gave them bad advice in the days of their youth should come\nforward as accusers, and take their revenge; or if they do not like to come\nthemselves, some of their relatives, fathers, brothers, or other kinsmen,\nshould say what evil their families have suffered at my hands. Now is their\ntime. Many of them I see in the court. There is Crito, who is of the same age\nand of the same deme with myself, and there is Critobulus his son, whom I also\nsee. Then again there is Lysanias of Sphettus, who is the father of\nAeschines\u2014he is present; and also there is Antiphon of Cephisus, who is\nthe father of Epigenes; and there are the brothers of several who have\nassociated with me. There is Nicostratus the son of Theosdotides, and the\nbrother of Theodotus (now Theodotus himself is dead, and therefore he, at any\nrate, will not seek to stop him); and there is Paralus the son of Demodocus,\nwho had a brother Theages; and Adeimantus the son of Ariston, whose brother\nPlato is present; and Aeantodorus, who is the brother of Apollodorus, whom I\nalso see. I might mention a great many others, some of whom Meletus should have\nproduced as witnesses in the course of his speech; and let him still produce\nthem, if he has forgotten\u2014I will make way for him. And let him say, if he\nhas any testimony of the sort which he can produce. Nay, Athenians, the very\nopposite is the truth. For all these are ready to witness on behalf of the\ncorrupter, of the injurer of their kindred, as Meletus and Anytus call me; not\nthe corrupted youth only\u2014there might have been a motive for\nthat\u2014but their uncorrupted elder relatives. Why should they too support\nme with their testimony? Why, indeed, except for the sake of truth and justice,\nand because they know that I am speaking the truth, and that Meletus is a liar.\n</p>\n<p>\nWell, Athenians, this and the like of this is all the defence which I have to\noffer. Yet a word more. Perhaps there may be some one who is offended at me,\nwhen he calls to mind how he himself on a similar, or even a less serious\noccasion, prayed and entreated the judges with many tears, and how he produced\nhis children in court, which was a moving spectacle, together with a host of\nrelations and friends; whereas I, who am probably in danger of my life, will do\nnone of these things. The contrast may occur to his mind, and he may be set\nagainst me, and vote in anger because he is displeased at me on this account.\nNow if there be such a person among you,\u2014mind, I do not say that there\nis,\u2014to him I may fairly reply: My friend, I am a man, and like other men,\na creature of flesh and blood, and not \u201cof wood or stone,\u201d as Homer\nsays; and I have a family, yes, and sons, O Athenians, three in number, one\nalmost a man, and two others who are still young; and yet I will not bring any\nof them hither in order to petition you for an acquittal. And why not? Not from\nany self-assertion or want of respect for you. Whether I am or am not afraid of\ndeath is another question, of which I will not now speak. But, having regard to\npublic opinion, I feel that such conduct would be discreditable to myself, and\nto you, and to the whole state. One who has reached my years, and who has a\nname for wisdom, ought not to demean himself. Whether this opinion of me be\ndeserved or not, at any rate the world has decided that Socrates is in some way\nsuperior to other men. And if those among you who are said to be superior in\nwisdom and courage, and any other virtue, demean themselves in this way, how\nshameful is their conduct! I have seen men of reputation, when they have been\ncondemned, behaving in the strangest manner: they seemed to fancy that they\nwere going to suffer something dreadful if they died, and that they could be\nimmortal if you only allowed them to live; and I think that such are a\ndishonour to the state, and that any stranger coming in would have said of them\nthat the most eminent men of Athens, to whom the Athenians themselves give\nhonour and command, are no better than women. And I say that these things ought\nnot to be done by those of us who have a reputation; and if they are done, you\nought not to permit them; you ought rather to show that you are far more\ndisposed to condemn the man who gets up a doleful scene and makes the city\nridiculous, than him who holds his peace.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut, setting aside the question of public opinion, there seems to be something\nwrong in asking a favour of a judge, and thus procuring an acquittal, instead\nof informing and convincing him. For his duty is, not to make a present of\njustice, but to give judgment; and he has sworn that he will judge according to\nthe laws, and not according to his own good pleasure; and we ought not to\nencourage you, nor should you allow yourselves to be encouraged, in this habit\nof perjury\u2014there can be no piety in that. Do not then require me to do\nwhat I consider dishonourable and impious and wrong, especially now, when I am\nbeing tried for impiety on the indictment of Meletus. For if, O men of Athens,\nby force of persuasion and entreaty I could overpower your oaths, then I should\nbe teaching you to believe that there are no gods, and in defending should\nsimply convict myself of the charge of not believing in them. But that is not\nso\u2014far otherwise. For I do believe that there are gods, and in a sense\nhigher than that in which any of my accusers believe in them. And to you and to\nGod I commit my cause, to be determined by you as is best for you and me.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\nThere are many reasons why I am not grieved, O men of Athens, at the vote of\ncondemnation. I expected it, and am only surprised that the votes are so nearly\nequal; for I had thought that the majority against me would have been far\nlarger; but now, had thirty votes gone over to the other side, I should have\nbeen acquitted. And I may say, I think, that I have escaped Meletus. I may say\nmore; for without the assistance of Anytus and Lycon, any one may see that he\nwould not have had a fifth part of the votes, as the law requires, in which\ncase he would have incurred a fine of a thousand drachmae.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd so he proposes death as the penalty. And what shall I propose on my part, O\nmen of Athens? Clearly that which is my due. And what is my due? What return\nshall be made to the man who has never had the wit to be idle during his whole\nlife; but has been careless of what the many care for\u2014wealth, and family\ninterests, and military offices, and speaking in the assembly, and\nmagistracies, and plots, and parties. Reflecting that I was really too honest a\nman to be a politician and live, I did not go where I could do no good to you\nor to myself; but where I could do the greatest good privately to every one of\nyou, thither I went, and sought to persuade every man among you that he must\nlook to himself, and seek virtue and wisdom before he looks to his private\ninterests, and look to the state before he looks to the interests of the state;\nand that this should be the order which he observes in all his actions. What\nshall be done to such an one? Doubtless some good thing, O men of Athens, if he\nhas his reward; and the good should be of a kind suitable to him. What would be\na reward suitable to a poor man who is your benefactor, and who desires leisure\nthat he may instruct you? There can be no reward so fitting as maintenance in\nthe Prytaneum, O men of Athens, a reward which he deserves far more than the\ncitizen who has won the prize at Olympia in the horse or chariot race, whether\nthe chariots were drawn by two horses or by many. For I am in want, and he has\nenough; and he only gives you the appearance of happiness, and I give you the\nreality. And if I am to estimate the penalty fairly, I should say that\nmaintenance in the Prytaneum is the just return.\n</p>\n<p>\nPerhaps you think that I am braving you in what I am saying now, as in what I\nsaid before about the tears and prayers. But this is not so. I speak rather\nbecause I am convinced that I never intentionally wronged any one, although I\ncannot convince you\u2014the time has been too short; if there were a law at\nAthens, as there is in other cities, that a capital cause should not be decided\nin one day, then I believe that I should have convinced you. But I cannot in a\nmoment refute great slanders; and, as I am convinced that I never wronged\nanother, I will assuredly not wrong myself. I will not say of myself that I\ndeserve any evil, or propose any penalty. Why should I? because I am afraid of\nthe penalty of death which Meletus proposes? When I do not know whether death\nis a good or an evil, why should I propose a penalty which would certainly be\nan evil? Shall I say imprisonment? And why should I live in prison, and be the\nslave of the magistrates of the year\u2014of the Eleven? Or shall the penalty\nbe a fine, and imprisonment until the fine is paid? There is the same\nobjection. I should have to lie in prison, for money I have none, and cannot\npay. And if I say exile (and this may possibly be the penalty which you will\naffix), I must indeed be blinded by the love of life, if I am so irrational as\nto expect that when you, who are my own citizens, cannot endure my discourses\nand words, and have found them so grievous and odious that you will have no\nmore of them, others are likely to endure me. No indeed, men of Athens, that is\nnot very likely. And what a life should I lead, at my age, wandering from city\nto city, ever changing my place of exile, and always being driven out! For I am\nquite sure that wherever I go, there, as here, the young men will flock to me;\nand if I drive them away, their elders will drive me out at their request; and\nif I let them come, their fathers and friends will drive me out for their\nsakes.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome one will say: Yes, Socrates, but cannot you hold your tongue, and then you\nmay go into a foreign city, and no one will interfere with you? Now I have\ngreat difficulty in making you understand my answer to this. For if I tell you\nthat to do as you say would be a disobedience to the God, and therefore that I\ncannot hold my tongue, you will not believe that I am serious; and if I say\nagain that daily to discourse about virtue, and of those other things about\nwhich you hear me examining myself and others, is the greatest good of man, and\nthat the unexamined life is not worth living, you are still less likely to\nbelieve me. Yet I say what is true, although a thing of which it is hard for me\nto persuade you. Also, I have never been accustomed to think that I deserve to\nsuffer any harm. Had I money I might have estimated the offence at what I was\nable to pay, and not have been much the worse. But I have none, and therefore I\nmust ask you to proportion the fine to my means. Well, perhaps I could afford a\nmina, and therefore I propose that penalty: Plato, Crito, Critobulus, and\nApollodorus, my friends here, bid me say thirty min\u00e6, and they will be the\nsureties. Let thirty min\u00e6 be the penalty; for which sum they will be ample\nsecurity to you.\n</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>\nNot much time will be gained, O Athenians, in return for the evil name which\nyou will get from the detractors of the city, who will say that you killed\nSocrates, a wise man; for they will call me wise, even although I am not wise,\nwhen they want to reproach you. If you had waited a little while, your desire\nwould have been fulfilled in the course of nature. For I am far advanced in\nyears, as you may perceive, and not far from death. I am speaking now not to\nall of you, but only to those who have condemned me to death. And I have\nanother thing to say to them: you think that I was convicted because I had no\nwords of the sort which would have procured my acquittal\u2014I mean, if I had\nthought fit to leave nothing undone or unsaid. Not so; the deficiency which led\nto my conviction was not of words\u2014certainly not. But I had not the\nboldness or impudence or inclination to address you as you would have liked me\nto do, weeping and wailing and lamenting, and saying and doing many things\nwhich you have been accustomed to hear from others, and which, as I maintain,\nare unworthy of me. I thought at the time that I ought not to do anything\ncommon or mean when in danger: nor do I now repent of the style of my defence;\nI would rather die having spoken after my manner, than speak in your manner and\nlive. For neither in war nor yet at law ought I or any man to use every way of\nescaping death. Often in battle there can be no doubt that if a man will throw\naway his arms, and fall on his knees before his pursuers, he may escape death;\nand in other dangers there are other ways of escaping death, if a man is\nwilling to say and do anything. The difficulty, my friends, is not to avoid\ndeath, but to avoid unrighteousness; for that runs faster than death. I am old\nand move slowly, and the slower runner has overtaken me, and my accusers are\nkeen and quick, and the faster runner, who is unrighteousness, has overtaken\nthem. And now I depart hence condemned by you to suffer the penalty of\ndeath,\u2014they too go their ways condemned by the truth to suffer the\npenalty of villainy and wrong; and I must abide by my award\u2014let them\nabide by theirs. I suppose that these things may be regarded as\nfated,\u2014and I think that they are well.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd now, O men who have condemned me, I would fain prophesy to you; for I am\nabout to die, and in the hour of death men are gifted with prophetic power. And\nI prophesy to you who are my murderers, that immediately after my departure\npunishment far heavier than you have inflicted on me will surely await you. Me\nyou have killed because you wanted to escape the accuser, and not to give an\naccount of your lives. But that will not be as you suppose: far otherwise. For\nI say that there will be more accusers of you than there are now; accusers whom\nhitherto I have restrained: and as they are younger they will be more\ninconsiderate with you, and you will be more offended at them. If you think\nthat by killing men you can prevent some one from censuring your evil lives,\nyou are mistaken; that is not a way of escape which is either possible or\nhonourable; the easiest and the noblest way is not to be disabling others, but\nto be improving yourselves. This is the prophecy which I utter before my\ndeparture to the judges who have condemned me.\n</p>\n<p>\nFriends, who would have acquitted me, I would like also to talk with you about\nthe thing which has come to pass, while the magistrates are busy, and before I\ngo to the place at which I must die. Stay then a little, for we may as well\ntalk with one another while there is time. You are my friends, and I should\nlike to show you the meaning of this event which has happened to me. O my\njudges\u2014for you I may truly call judges\u2014I should like to tell you of\na wonderful circumstance. Hitherto the divine faculty of which the internal\noracle is the source has constantly been in the habit of opposing me even about\ntrifles, if I was going to make a slip or error in any matter; and now as you\nsee there has come upon me that which may be thought, and is generally believed\nto be, the last and worst evil. But the oracle made no sign of opposition,\neither when I was leaving my house in the morning, or when I was on my way to\nthe court, or while I was speaking, at anything which I was going to say; and\nyet I have often been stopped in the middle of a speech, but now in nothing I\neither said or did touching the matter in hand has the oracle opposed me. What\ndo I take to be the explanation of this silence? I will tell you. It is an\nintimation that what has happened to me is a good, and that those of us who\nthink that death is an evil are in error. For the customary sign would surely\nhave opposed me had I been going to evil and not to good.\n</p>\n<p>\nLet us reflect in another way, and we shall see that there is great reason to\nhope that death is a good; for one of two things\u2014either death is a state\nof nothingness and utter unconsciousness, or, as men say, there is a change and\nmigration of the soul from this world to another. Now if you suppose that there\nis no consciousness, but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even\nby dreams, death will be an unspeakable gain. For if a person were to select\nthe night in which his sleep was undisturbed even by dreams, and were to\ncompare with this the other days and nights of his life, and then were to tell\nus how many days and nights he had passed in the course of his life better and\nmore pleasantly than this one, I think that any man, I will not say a private\nman, but even the great king will not find many such days or nights, when\ncompared with the others. Now if death be of such a nature, I say that to die\nis gain; for eternity is then only a single night. But if death is the journey\nto another place, and there, as men say, all the dead abide, what good, O my\nfriends and judges, can be greater than this? If indeed when the pilgrim\narrives in the world below, he is delivered from the professors of justice in\nthis world, and finds the true judges who are said to give judgment there,\nMinos and Rhadamanthus and Aeacus and Triptolemus, and other sons of God who\nwere righteous in their own life, that pilgrimage will be worth making. What\nwould not a man give if he might converse with Orpheus and Musaeus and Hesiod\nand Homer? Nay, if this be true, let me die again and again. I myself, too,\nshall have a wonderful interest in there meeting and conversing with Palamedes,\nand Ajax the son of Telamon, and any other ancient hero who has suffered death\nthrough an unjust judgment; and there will be no small pleasure, as I think, in\ncomparing my own sufferings with theirs. Above all, I shall then be able to\ncontinue my search into true and false knowledge; as in this world, so also in\nthe next; and I shall find out who is wise, and who pretends to be wise, and is\nnot. What would not a man give, O judges, to be able to examine the leader of\nthe great Trojan expedition; or Odysseus or Sisyphus, or numberless others, men\nand women too! What infinite delight would there be in conversing with them and\nasking them questions! In another world they do not put a man to death for\nasking questions: assuredly not. For besides being happier than we are, they\nwill be immortal, if what is said is true.\n</p>\n<p>\nWherefore, O judges, be of good cheer about death, and know of a certainty,\nthat no evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death. He and\nhis are not neglected by the gods; nor has my own approaching end happened by\nmere chance. But I see clearly that the time had arrived when it was better for\nme to die and be released from trouble; wherefore the oracle gave no sign. For\nwhich reason, also, I am not angry with my condemners, or with my accusers;\nthey have done me no harm, although they did not mean to do me any good; and\nfor this I may gently blame them.\n</p>\n<p>\nStill I have a favour to ask of them. When my sons are grown up, I would ask\nyou, O my friends, to punish them; and I would have you trouble them, as I have\ntroubled you, if they seem to care about riches, or anything, more than about\nvirtue; or if they pretend to be something when they are really\nnothing,\u2014then reprove them, as I have reproved you, for not caring about\nthat for which they ought to care, and thinking that they are something when\nthey are really nothing. And if you do this, both I and my sons will have\nreceived justice at your hands.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways\u2014I to die, and you\nto live. Which is better God only knows.\n</p>\n</div><h2><a id=\"chap02\"></a>APOLOGY</h2>", "chap02": "<a id=\"chap02\"></a><p>\nHow you, O Athenians, have been affected by my accusers, I cannot tell; but I\nknow that they almost made me forget who I was\u2014so persuasively did they\nspeak; and yet they have hardly uttered a word of truth. But of the many\nfalsehoods told by them, there was one which quite amazed me;\u2014I mean when\nthey said that you should be upon your guard and not allow yourselves to be\ndeceived by the force of my eloquence. To say this, when they were certain to\nbe detected as soon as I opened my lips and proved myself to be anything but a\ngreat speaker, did indeed appear to me most shameless\u2014unless by the force\nof eloquence they mean the force of truth; for if such is their meaning, I\nadmit that I am eloquent. But in how different a way from theirs! Well, as I\nwas saying, they have scarcely spoken the truth at all; but from me you shall\nhear the whole truth: not, however, delivered after their manner in a set\noration duly ornamented with words and phrases. No, by heaven! but I shall use\nthe words and arguments which occur to me at the moment; for I am confident in\nthe justice of my cause (Or, I am certain that I am right in taking this\ncourse.): at my time of life I ought not to be appearing before you, O men of\nAthens, in the character of a juvenile orator\u2014let no one expect it of me.\nAnd I must beg of you to grant me a favour:\u2014If I defend myself in my\naccustomed manner, and you hear me using the words which I have been in the\nhabit of using in the agora, at the tables of the money-changers, or anywhere\nelse, I would ask you not to be surprised, and not to interrupt me on this\naccount. For I am more than seventy years of age, and appearing now for the\nfirst time in a court of law, I am quite a stranger to the language of the\nplace; and therefore I would have you regard me as if I were really a stranger,\nwhom you would excuse if he spoke in his native tongue, and after the fashion\nof his country:\u2014Am I making an unfair request of you? Never mind the\nmanner, which may or may not be good; but think only of the truth of my words,\nand give heed to that: let the speaker speak truly and the judge decide justly.\n</p><p>\nAnd first, I have to reply to the older charges and to my first accusers, and\nthen I will go on to the later ones. For of old I have had many accusers, who\nhave accused me falsely to you during many years; and I am more afraid of them\nthan of Anytus and his associates, who are dangerous, too, in their own way.\nBut far more dangerous are the others, who began when you were children, and\ntook possession of your minds with their falsehoods, telling of one Socrates, a\nwise man, who speculated about the heaven above, and searched into the earth\nbeneath, and made the worse appear the better cause. The disseminators of this\ntale are the accusers whom I dread; for their hearers are apt to fancy that\nsuch enquirers do not believe in the existence of the gods. And they are many,\nand their charges against me are of ancient date, and they were made by them in\nthe days when you were more impressible than you are now\u2014in childhood, or\nit may have been in youth\u2014and the cause when heard went by default, for\nthere was none to answer. And hardest of all, I do not know and cannot tell the\nnames of my accusers; unless in the chance case of a Comic poet. All who from\nenvy and malice have persuaded you\u2014some of them having first convinced\nthemselves\u2014all this class of men are most difficult to deal with; for I\ncannot have them up here, and cross-examine them, and therefore I must simply\nfight with shadows in my own defence, and argue when there is no one who\nanswers. I will ask you then to assume with me, as I was saying, that my\nopponents are of two kinds; one recent, the other ancient: and I hope that you\nwill see the propriety of my answering the latter first, for these accusations\nyou heard long before the others, and much oftener.\n</p><p>\nWell, then, I must make my defence, and endeavour to clear away in a short\ntime, a slander which has lasted a long time. May I succeed, if to succeed be\nfor my good and yours, or likely to avail me in my cause! The task is not an\neasy one; I quite understand the nature of it. And so leaving the event with\nGod, in obedience to the law I will now make my defence.\n</p><p>\nI will begin at the beginning, and ask what is the accusation which has given\nrise to the slander of me, and in fact has encouraged Meletus to proof this\ncharge against me. Well, what do the slanderers say? They shall be my\nprosecutors, and I will sum up their words in an affidavit: \u201cSocrates is\nan evil-doer, and a curious person, who searches into things under the earth\nand in heaven, and he makes the worse appear the better cause; and he teaches\nthe aforesaid doctrines to others.\u201d Such is the nature of the accusation:\nit is just what you have yourselves seen in the comedy of Aristophanes\n(Aristoph., Clouds.), who has introduced a man whom he calls Socrates, going\nabout and saying that he walks in air, and talking a deal of nonsense\nconcerning matters of which I do not pretend to know either much or\nlittle\u2014not that I mean to speak disparagingly of any one who is a student\nof natural philosophy. I should be very sorry if Meletus could bring so grave a\ncharge against me. But the simple truth is, O Athenians, that I have nothing to\ndo with physical speculations. Very many of those here present are witnesses to\nthe truth of this, and to them I appeal. Speak then, you who have heard me, and\ntell your neighbours whether any of you have ever known me hold forth in few\nwords or in many upon such matters...You hear their answer. And from what they\nsay of this part of the charge you will be able to judge of the truth of the\nrest.\n</p><p>\nAs little foundation is there for the report that I am a teacher, and take\nmoney; this accusation has no more truth in it than the other. Although, if a\nman were really able to instruct mankind, to receive money for giving\ninstruction would, in my opinion, be an honour to him. There is Gorgias of\nLeontium, and Prodicus of Ceos, and Hippias of Elis, who go the round of the\ncities, and are able to persuade the young men to leave their own citizens by\nwhom they might be taught for nothing, and come to them whom they not only pay,\nbut are thankful if they may be allowed to pay them. There is at this time a\nParian philosopher residing in Athens, of whom I have heard; and I came to hear\nof him in this way:\u2014I came across a man who has spent a world of money on\nthe Sophists, Callias, the son of Hipponicus, and knowing that he had sons, I\nasked him: \u201cCallias,\u201d I said, \u201cif your two sons were foals or\ncalves, there would be no difficulty in finding some one to put over them; we\nshould hire a trainer of horses, or a farmer probably, who would improve and\nperfect them in their own proper virtue and excellence; but as they are human\nbeings, whom are you thinking of placing over them? Is there any one who\nunderstands human and political virtue? You must have thought about the matter,\nfor you have sons; is there any one?\u201d \u201cThere is,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWho is he?\u201d said I; \u201cand of what country? and what does he\ncharge?\u201d \u201cEvenus the Parian,\u201d he replied; \u201che is the\nman, and his charge is five min\u00e6.\u201d Happy is Evenus, I said to myself, if\nhe really has this wisdom, and teaches at such a moderate charge. Had I the\nsame, I should have been very proud and conceited; but the truth is that I have\nno knowledge of the kind.\n</p><p>\nI dare say, Athenians, that some one among you will reply, \u201cYes,\nSocrates, but what is the origin of these accusations which are brought against\nyou; there must have been something strange which you have been doing? All\nthese rumours and this talk about you would never have arisen if you had been\nlike other men: tell us, then, what is the cause of them, for we should be\nsorry to judge hastily of you.\u201d Now I regard this as a fair challenge,\nand I will endeavour to explain to you the reason why I am called wise and have\nsuch an evil fame. Please to attend then. And although some of you may think\nthat I am joking, I declare that I will tell you the entire truth. Men of\nAthens, this reputation of mine has come of a certain sort of wisdom which I\npossess. If you ask me what kind of wisdom, I reply, wisdom such as may perhaps\nbe attained by man, for to that extent I am inclined to believe that I am wise;\nwhereas the persons of whom I was speaking have a superhuman wisdom which I may\nfail to describe, because I have it not myself; and he who says that I have,\nspeaks falsely, and is taking away my character. And here, O men of Athens, I\nmust beg you not to interrupt me, even if I seem to say something extravagant.\nFor the word which I will speak is not mine. I will refer you to a witness who\nis worthy of credit; that witness shall be the God of Delphi\u2014he will tell\nyou about my wisdom, if I have any, and of what sort it is. You must have known\nChaerephon; he was early a friend of mine, and also a friend of yours, for he\nshared in the recent exile of the people, and returned with you. Well,\nChaerephon, as you know, was very impetuous in all his doings, and he went to\nDelphi and boldly asked the oracle to tell him whether\u2014as I was saying, I\nmust beg you not to interrupt\u2014he asked the oracle to tell him whether\nanyone was wiser than I was, and the Pythian prophetess answered, that there\nwas no man wiser. Chaerephon is dead himself; but his brother, who is in court,\nwill confirm the truth of what I am saying.\n</p><p>\nWhy do I mention this? Because I am going to explain to you why I have such an\nevil name. When I heard the answer, I said to myself, What can the god mean?\nand what is the interpretation of his riddle? for I know that I have no wisdom,\nsmall or great. What then can he mean when he says that I am the wisest of men?\nAnd yet he is a god, and cannot lie; that would be against his nature. After\nlong consideration, I thought of a method of trying the question. I reflected\nthat if I could only find a man wiser than myself, then I might go to the god\nwith a refutation in my hand. I should say to him, \u201cHere is a man who is\nwiser than I am; but you said that I was the wisest.\u201d Accordingly I went\nto one who had the reputation of wisdom, and observed him\u2014his name I need\nnot mention; he was a politician whom I selected for examination\u2014and the\nresult was as follows: When I began to talk with him, I could not help thinking\nthat he was not really wise, although he was thought wise by many, and still\nwiser by himself; and thereupon I tried to explain to him that he thought\nhimself wise, but was not really wise; and the consequence was that he hated\nme, and his enmity was shared by several who were present and heard me. So I\nleft him, saying to myself, as I went away: Well, although I do not suppose\nthat either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am better off\nthan he is,\u2014for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows; I neither\nknow nor think that I know. In this latter particular, then, I seem to have\nslightly the advantage of him. Then I went to another who had still higher\npretensions to wisdom, and my conclusion was exactly the same. Whereupon I made\nanother enemy of him, and of many others besides him.\n</p><p>\nThen I went to one man after another, being not unconscious of the enmity which\nI provoked, and I lamented and feared this: but necessity was laid upon\nme,\u2014the word of God, I thought, ought to be considered first. And I said\nto myself, Go I must to all who appear to know, and find out the meaning of the\noracle. And I swear to you, Athenians, by the dog I swear!\u2014for I must\ntell you the truth\u2014the result of my mission was just this: I found that\nthe men most in repute were all but the most foolish; and that others less\nesteemed were really wiser and better. I will tell you the tale of my\nwanderings and of the \u201cHerculean\u201d labours, as I may call them,\nwhich I endured only to find at last the oracle irrefutable. After the\npoliticians, I went to the poets; tragic, dithyrambic, and all sorts. And\nthere, I said to myself, you will be instantly detected; now you will find out\nthat you are more ignorant than they are. Accordingly, I took them some of the\nmost elaborate passages in their own writings, and asked what was the meaning\nof them\u2014thinking that they would teach me something. Will you believe me?\nI am almost ashamed to confess the truth, but I must say that there is hardly a\nperson present who would not have talked better about their poetry than they\ndid themselves. Then I knew that not by wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a\nsort of genius and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also\nsay many fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them. The poets\nappeared to me to be much in the same case; and I further observed that upon\nthe strength of their poetry they believed themselves to be the wisest of men\nin other things in which they were not wise. So I departed, conceiving myself\nto be superior to them for the same reason that I was superior to the\npoliticians.\n</p><p>\nAt last I went to the artisans. I was conscious that I knew nothing at all, as\nI may say, and I was sure that they knew many fine things; and here I was not\nmistaken, for they did know many things of which I was ignorant, and in this\nthey certainly were wiser than I was. But I observed that even the good\nartisans fell into the same error as the poets;\u2014because they were good\nworkmen they thought that they also knew all sorts of high matters, and this\ndefect in them overshadowed their wisdom; and therefore I asked myself on\nbehalf of the oracle, whether I would like to be as I was, neither having their\nknowledge nor their ignorance, or like them in both; and I made answer to\nmyself and to the oracle that I was better off as I was.\n</p><p>\nThis inquisition has led to my having many enemies of the worst and most\ndangerous kind, and has given occasion also to many calumnies. And I am called\nwise, for my hearers always imagine that I myself possess the wisdom which I\nfind wanting in others: but the truth is, O men of Athens, that God only is\nwise; and by his answer he intends to show that the wisdom of men is worth\nlittle or nothing; he is not speaking of Socrates, he is only using my name by\nway of illustration, as if he said, He, O men, is the wisest, who, like\nSocrates, knows that his wisdom is in truth worth nothing. And so I go about\nthe world, obedient to the god, and search and make enquiry into the wisdom of\nany one, whether citizen or stranger, who appears to be wise; and if he is not\nwise, then in vindication of the oracle I show him that he is not wise; and my\noccupation quite absorbs me, and I have no time to give either to any public\nmatter of interest or to any concern of my own, but I am in utter poverty by\nreason of my devotion to the god.\n</p><p>\nThere is another thing:\u2014young men of the richer classes, who have not\nmuch to do, come about me of their own accord; they like to hear the pretenders\nexamined, and they often imitate me, and proceed to examine others; there are\nplenty of persons, as they quickly discover, who think that they know\nsomething, but really know little or nothing; and then those who are examined\nby them instead of being angry with themselves are angry with me: This\nconfounded Socrates, they say; this villainous misleader of youth!\u2014and\nthen if somebody asks them, Why, what evil does he practise or teach? they do\nnot know, and cannot tell; but in order that they may not appear to be at a\nloss, they repeat the ready-made charges which are used against all\nphilosophers about teaching things up in the clouds and under the earth, and\nhaving no gods, and making the worse appear the better cause; for they do not\nlike to confess that their pretence of knowledge has been detected\u2014which\nis the truth; and as they are numerous and ambitious and energetic, and are\ndrawn up in battle array and have persuasive tongues, they have filled your\nears with their loud and inveterate calumnies. And this is the reason why my\nthree accusers, Meletus and Anytus and Lycon, have set upon me; Meletus, who\nhas a quarrel with me on behalf of the poets; Anytus, on behalf of the\ncraftsmen and politicians; Lycon, on behalf of the rhetoricians: and as I said\nat the beginning, I cannot expect to get rid of such a mass of calumny all in a\nmoment. And this, O men of Athens, is the truth and the whole truth; I have\nconcealed nothing, I have dissembled nothing. And yet, I know that my plainness\nof speech makes them hate me, and what is their hatred but a proof that I am\nspeaking the truth?\u2014Hence has arisen the prejudice against me; and this\nis the reason of it, as you will find out either in this or in any future\nenquiry.\n</p><p>\nI have said enough in my defence against the first class of my accusers; I turn\nto the second class. They are headed by Meletus, that good man and true lover\nof his country, as he calls himself. Against these, too, I must try to make a\ndefence:\u2014Let their affidavit be read: it contains something of this kind:\nIt says that Socrates is a doer of evil, who corrupts the youth; and who does\nnot believe in the gods of the state, but has other new divinities of his own.\nSuch is the charge; and now let us examine the particular counts. He says that\nI am a doer of evil, and corrupt the youth; but I say, O men of Athens, that\nMeletus is a doer of evil, in that he pretends to be in earnest when he is only\nin jest, and is so eager to bring men to trial from a pretended zeal and\ninterest about matters in which he really never had the smallest interest. And\nthe truth of this I will endeavour to prove to you.\n</p><p>\nCome hither, Meletus, and let me ask a question of you. You think a great deal\nabout the improvement of youth?\n</p><p>\nYes, I do.\n</p><p>\nTell the judges, then, who is their improver; for you must know, as you have\ntaken the pains to discover their corrupter, and are citing and accusing me\nbefore them. Speak, then, and tell the judges who their improver\nis.\u2014Observe, Meletus, that you are silent, and have nothing to say. But\nis not this rather disgraceful, and a very considerable proof of what I was\nsaying, that you have no interest in the matter? Speak up, friend, and tell us\nwho their improver is.\n</p><p>\nThe laws.\n</p><p>\nBut that, my good sir, is not my meaning. I want to know who the person is,\nwho, in the first place, knows the laws.\n</p><p>\nThe judges, Socrates, who are present in court.\n</p><p>\nWhat, do you mean to say, Meletus, that they are able to instruct and improve\nyouth?\n</p><p>\nCertainly they are.\n</p><p>\nWhat, all of them, or some only and not others?\n</p><p>\nAll of them.\n</p><p>\nBy the goddess Here, that is good news! There are plenty of improvers, then.\nAnd what do you say of the audience,\u2014do they improve them?\n</p><p>\nYes, they do.\n</p><p>\nAnd the senators?\n</p><p>\nYes, the senators improve them.\n</p><p>\nBut perhaps the members of the assembly corrupt them?\u2014or do they too\nimprove them?\n</p><p>\nThey improve them.\n</p><p>\nThen every Athenian improves and elevates them; all with the exception of\nmyself; and I alone am their corrupter? Is that what you affirm?\n</p><p>\nThat is what I stoutly affirm.\n</p><p>\nI am very unfortunate if you are right. But suppose I ask you a question: How\nabout horses? Does one man do them harm and all the world good? Is not the\nexact opposite the truth? One man is able to do them good, or at least not\nmany;\u2014the trainer of horses, that is to say, does them good, and others\nwho have to do with them rather injure them? Is not that true, Meletus, of\nhorses, or of any other animals? Most assuredly it is; whether you and Anytus\nsay yes or no. Happy indeed would be the condition of youth if they had one\ncorrupter only, and all the rest of the world were their improvers. But you,\nMeletus, have sufficiently shown that you never had a thought about the young:\nyour carelessness is seen in your not caring about the very things which you\nbring against me.\n</p><p>\nAnd now, Meletus, I will ask you another question\u2014by Zeus I will: Which\nis better, to live among bad citizens, or among good ones? Answer, friend, I\nsay; the question is one which may be easily answered. Do not the good do their\nneighbours good, and the bad do them evil?\n</p><p>\nCertainly.\n</p><p>\nAnd is there anyone who would rather be injured than benefited by those who\nlive with him? Answer, my good friend, the law requires you to\nanswer\u2014does any one like to be injured?\n</p><p>\nCertainly not.\n</p><p>\nAnd when you accuse me of corrupting and deteriorating the youth, do you allege\nthat I corrupt them intentionally or unintentionally?\n</p><p>\nIntentionally, I say.\n</p><p>\nBut you have just admitted that the good do their neighbours good, and the evil\ndo them evil. Now, is that a truth which your superior wisdom has recognized\nthus early in life, and am I, at my age, in such darkness and ignorance as not\nto know that if a man with whom I have to live is corrupted by me, I am very\nlikely to be harmed by him; and yet I corrupt him, and intentionally,\ntoo\u2014so you say, although neither I nor any other human being is ever\nlikely to be convinced by you. But either I do not corrupt them, or I corrupt\nthem unintentionally; and on either view of the case you lie. If my offence is\nunintentional, the law has no cognizance of unintentional offences: you ought\nto have taken me privately, and warned and admonished me; for if I had been\nbetter advised, I should have left off doing what I only did\nunintentionally\u2014no doubt I should; but you would have nothing to say to\nme and refused to teach me. And now you bring me up in this court, which is a\nplace not of instruction, but of punishment.\n</p><p>\nIt will be very clear to you, Athenians, as I was saying, that Meletus has no\ncare at all, great or small, about the matter. But still I should like to know,\nMeletus, in what I am affirmed to corrupt the young. I suppose you mean, as I\ninfer from your indictment, that I teach them not to acknowledge the gods which\nthe state acknowledges, but some other new divinities or spiritual agencies in\ntheir stead. These are the lessons by which I corrupt the youth, as you say.\n</p><p>\nYes, that I say emphatically.\n</p><p>\nThen, by the gods, Meletus, of whom we are speaking, tell me and the court, in\nsomewhat plainer terms, what you mean! for I do not as yet understand whether\nyou affirm that I teach other men to acknowledge some gods, and therefore that\nI do believe in gods, and am not an entire atheist\u2014this you do not lay to\nmy charge,\u2014but only you say that they are not the same gods which the\ncity recognizes\u2014the charge is that they are different gods. Or, do you\nmean that I am an atheist simply, and a teacher of atheism?\n</p><p>\nI mean the latter\u2014that you are a complete atheist.\n</p><p>\nWhat an extraordinary statement! Why do you think so, Meletus? Do you mean that\nI do not believe in the godhead of the sun or moon, like other men?\n</p><p>\nI assure you, judges, that he does not: for he says that the sun is stone, and\nthe moon earth.\n</p><p>\nFriend Meletus, you think that you are accusing Anaxagoras: and you have but a\nbad opinion of the judges, if you fancy them illiterate to such a degree as not\nto know that these doctrines are found in the books of Anaxagoras the\nClazomenian, which are full of them. And so, forsooth, the youth are said to be\ntaught them by Socrates, when there are not unfrequently exhibitions of them at\nthe theatre (Probably in allusion to Aristophanes who caricatured, and to\nEuripides who borrowed the notions of Anaxagoras, as well as to other dramatic\npoets.) (price of admission one drachma at the most); and they might pay their\nmoney, and laugh at Socrates if he pretends to father these extraordinary\nviews. And so, Meletus, you really think that I do not believe in any god?\n</p><p>\nI swear by Zeus that you believe absolutely in none at all.\n</p><p>\nNobody will believe you, Meletus, and I am pretty sure that you do not believe\nyourself. I cannot help thinking, men of Athens, that Meletus is reckless and\nimpudent, and that he has written this indictment in a spirit of mere\nwantonness and youthful bravado. Has he not compounded a riddle, thinking to\ntry me? He said to himself:\u2014I shall see whether the wise Socrates will\ndiscover my facetious contradiction, or whether I shall be able to deceive him\nand the rest of them. For he certainly does appear to me to contradict himself\nin the indictment as much as if he said that Socrates is guilty of not\nbelieving in the gods, and yet of believing in them\u2014but this is not like\na person who is in earnest.\n</p><p>\nI should like you, O men of Athens, to join me in examining what I conceive to\nbe his inconsistency; and do you, Meletus, answer. And I must remind the\naudience of my request that they would not make a disturbance if I speak in my\naccustomed manner:\n</p><p>\nDid ever man, Meletus, believe in the existence of human things, and not of\nhuman beings?...I wish, men of Athens, that he would answer, and not be always\ntrying to get up an interruption. Did ever any man believe in horsemanship, and\nnot in horses? or in flute-playing, and not in flute-players? No, my friend; I\nwill answer to you and to the court, as you refuse to answer for yourself.\nThere is no man who ever did. But now please to answer the next question: Can a\nman believe in spiritual and divine agencies, and not in spirits or demigods?\n</p><p>\nHe cannot.\n</p><p>\nHow lucky I am to have extracted that answer, by the assistance of the court!\nBut then you swear in the indictment that I teach and believe in divine or\nspiritual agencies (new or old, no matter for that); at any rate, I believe in\nspiritual agencies,\u2014so you say and swear in the affidavit; and yet if I\nbelieve in divine beings, how can I help believing in spirits or\ndemigods;\u2014must I not? To be sure I must; and therefore I may assume that\nyour silence gives consent. Now what are spirits or demigods? Are they not\neither gods or the sons of gods?\n</p><p>\nCertainly they are.\n</p><p>\nBut this is what I call the facetious riddle invented by you: the demigods or\nspirits are gods, and you say first that I do not believe in gods, and then\nagain that I do believe in gods; that is, if I believe in demigods. For if the\ndemigods are the illegitimate sons of gods, whether by the nymphs or by any\nother mothers, of whom they are said to be the sons\u2014what human being will\never believe that there are no gods if they are the sons of gods? You might as\nwell affirm the existence of mules, and deny that of horses and asses. Such\nnonsense, Meletus, could only have been intended by you to make trial of me.\nYou have put this into the indictment because you had nothing real of which to\naccuse me. But no one who has a particle of understanding will ever be\nconvinced by you that the same men can believe in divine and superhuman things,\nand yet not believe that there are gods and demigods and heroes.\n</p><p>\nI have said enough in answer to the charge of Meletus: any elaborate defence is\nunnecessary, but I know only too well how many are the enmities which I have\nincurred, and this is what will be my destruction if I am destroyed;\u2014not\nMeletus, nor yet Anytus, but the envy and detraction of the world, which has\nbeen the death of many good men, and will probably be the death of many more;\nthere is no danger of my being the last of them.\n</p><p>\nSome one will say: And are you not ashamed, Socrates, of a course of life which\nis likely to bring you to an untimely end? To him I may fairly answer: There\nyou are mistaken: a man who is good for anything ought not to calculate the\nchance of living or dying; he ought only to consider whether in doing anything\nhe is doing right or wrong\u2014acting the part of a good man or of a bad.\nWhereas, upon your view, the heroes who fell at Troy were not good for much,\nand the son of Thetis above all, who altogether despised danger in comparison\nwith disgrace; and when he was so eager to slay Hector, his goddess mother said\nto him, that if he avenged his companion Patroclus, and slew Hector, he would\ndie himself\u2014\u201cFate,\u201d she said, in these or the like words,\n\u201cwaits for you next after Hector;\u201d he, receiving this warning,\nutterly despised danger and death, and instead of fearing them, feared rather\nto live in dishonour, and not to avenge his friend. \u201cLet me die\nforthwith,\u201d he replies, \u201cand be avenged of my enemy, rather than\nabide here by the beaked ships, a laughing-stock and a burden of the\nearth.\u201d Had Achilles any thought of death and danger? For wherever a\nman\u2019s place is, whether the place which he has chosen or that in which he\nhas been placed by a commander, there he ought to remain in the hour of danger;\nhe should not think of death or of anything but of disgrace. And this, O men of\nAthens, is a true saying.\n</p><p>\nStrange, indeed, would be my conduct, O men of Athens, if I who, when I was\nordered by the generals whom you chose to command me at Potidaea and Amphipolis\nand Delium, remained where they placed me, like any other man, facing\ndeath\u2014if now, when, as I conceive and imagine, God orders me to fulfil\nthe philosopher\u2019s mission of searching into myself and other men, I were\nto desert my post through fear of death, or any other fear; that would indeed\nbe strange, and I might justly be arraigned in court for denying the existence\nof the gods, if I disobeyed the oracle because I was afraid of death, fancying\nthat I was wise when I was not wise. For the fear of death is indeed the\npretence of wisdom, and not real wisdom, being a pretence of knowing the\nunknown; and no one knows whether death, which men in their fear apprehend to\nbe the greatest evil, may not be the greatest good. Is not this ignorance of a\ndisgraceful sort, the ignorance which is the conceit that a man knows what he\ndoes not know? And in this respect only I believe myself to differ from men in\ngeneral, and may perhaps claim to be wiser than they are:\u2014that whereas I\nknow but little of the world below, I do not suppose that I know: but I do know\nthat injustice and disobedience to a better, whether God or man, is evil and\ndishonourable, and I will never fear or avoid a possible good rather than a\ncertain evil. And therefore if you let me go now, and are not convinced by\nAnytus, who said that since I had been prosecuted I must be put to death; (or\nif not that I ought never to have been prosecuted at all); and that if I escape\nnow, your sons will all be utterly ruined by listening to my words\u2014if you\nsay to me, Socrates, this time we will not mind Anytus, and you shall be let\noff, but upon one condition, that you are not to enquire and speculate in this\nway any more, and that if you are caught doing so again you shall die;\u2014if\nthis was the condition on which you let me go, I should reply: Men of Athens, I\nhonour and love you; but I shall obey God rather than you, and while I have\nlife and strength I shall never cease from the practice and teaching of\nphilosophy, exhorting any one whom I meet and saying to him after my manner:\nYou, my friend,\u2014a citizen of the great and mighty and wise city of\nAthens,\u2014are you not ashamed of heaping up the greatest amount of money\nand honour and reputation, and caring so little about wisdom and truth and the\ngreatest improvement of the soul, which you never regard or heed at all? And if\nthe person with whom I am arguing, says: Yes, but I do care; then I do not\nleave him or let him go at once; but I proceed to interrogate and examine and\ncross-examine him, and if I think that he has no virtue in him, but only says\nthat he has, I reproach him with undervaluing the greater, and overvaluing the\nless. And I shall repeat the same words to every one whom I meet, young and\nold, citizen and alien, but especially to the citizens, inasmuch as they are my\nbrethren. For know that this is the command of God; and I believe that no\ngreater good has ever happened in the state than my service to the God. For I\ndo nothing but go about persuading you all, old and young alike, not to take\nthought for your persons or your properties, but first and chiefly to care\nabout the greatest improvement of the soul. I tell you that virtue is not given\nby money, but that from virtue comes money and every other good of man, public\nas well as private. This is my teaching, and if this is the doctrine which\ncorrupts the youth, I am a mischievous person. But if any one says that this is\nnot my teaching, he is speaking an untruth. Wherefore, O men of Athens, I say\nto you, do as Anytus bids or not as Anytus bids, and either acquit me or not;\nbut whichever you do, understand that I shall never alter my ways, not even if\nI have to die many times.\n</p><p>\nMen of Athens, do not interrupt, but hear me; there was an understanding\nbetween us that you should hear me to the end: I have something more to say, at\nwhich you may be inclined to cry out; but I believe that to hear me will be\ngood for you, and therefore I beg that you will not cry out. I would have you\nknow, that if you kill such an one as I am, you will injure yourselves more\nthan you will injure me. Nothing will injure me, not Meletus nor yet\nAnytus\u2014they cannot, for a bad man is not permitted to injure a better\nthan himself. I do not deny that Anytus may, perhaps, kill him, or drive him\ninto exile, or deprive him of civil rights; and he may imagine, and others may\nimagine, that he is inflicting a great injury upon him: but there I do not\nagree. For the evil of doing as he is doing\u2014the evil of unjustly taking\naway the life of another\u2014is greater far.\n</p><p>\nAnd now, Athenians, I am not going to argue for my own sake, as you may think,\nbut for yours, that you may not sin against the God by condemning me, who am\nhis gift to you. For if you kill me you will not easily find a successor to me,\nwho, if I may use such a ludicrous figure of speech, am a sort of gadfly, given\nto the state by God; and the state is a great and noble steed who is tardy in\nhis motions owing to his very size, and requires to be stirred into life. I am\nthat gadfly which God has attached to the state, and all day long and in all\nplaces am always fastening upon you, arousing and persuading and reproaching\nyou. You will not easily find another like me, and therefore I would advise you\nto spare me. I dare say that you may feel out of temper (like a person who is\nsuddenly awakened from sleep), and you think that you might easily strike me\ndead as Anytus advises, and then you would sleep on for the remainder of your\nlives, unless God in his care of you sent you another gadfly. When I say that I\nam given to you by God, the proof of my mission is this:\u2014if I had been\nlike other men, I should not have neglected all my own concerns or patiently\nseen the neglect of them during all these years, and have been doing yours,\ncoming to you individually like a father or elder brother, exhorting you to\nregard virtue; such conduct, I say, would be unlike human nature. If I had\ngained anything, or if my exhortations had been paid, there would have been\nsome sense in my doing so; but now, as you will perceive, not even the\nimpudence of my accusers dares to say that I have ever exacted or sought pay of\nany one; of that they have no witness. And I have a sufficient witness to the\ntruth of what I say\u2014my poverty.\n</p><p>\nSome one may wonder why I go about in private giving advice and busying myself\nwith the concerns of others, but do not venture to come forward in public and\nadvise the state. I will tell you why. You have heard me speak at sundry times\nand in divers places of an oracle or sign which comes to me, and is the\ndivinity which Meletus ridicules in the indictment. This sign, which is a kind\nof voice, first began to come to me when I was a child; it always forbids but\nnever commands me to do anything which I am going to do. This is what deters me\nfrom being a politician. And rightly, as I think. For I am certain, O men of\nAthens, that if I had engaged in politics, I should have perished long ago, and\ndone no good either to you or to myself. And do not be offended at my telling\nyou the truth: for the truth is, that no man who goes to war with you or any\nother multitude, honestly striving against the many lawless and unrighteous\ndeeds which are done in a state, will save his life; he who will fight for the\nright, if he would live even for a brief space, must have a private station and\nnot a public one.\n</p><p>\nI can give you convincing evidence of what I say, not words only, but what you\nvalue far more\u2014actions. Let me relate to you a passage of my own life\nwhich will prove to you that I should never have yielded to injustice from any\nfear of death, and that \u201cas I should have refused to yield\u201d I must\nhave died at once. I will tell you a tale of the courts, not very interesting\nperhaps, but nevertheless true. The only office of state which I ever held, O\nmen of Athens, was that of senator: the tribe Antiochis, which is my tribe, had\nthe presidency at the trial of the generals who had not taken up the bodies of\nthe slain after the battle of Arginusae; and you proposed to try them in a\nbody, contrary to law, as you all thought afterwards; but at the time I was the\nonly one of the Prytanes who was opposed to the illegality, and I gave my vote\nagainst you; and when the orators threatened to impeach and arrest me, and you\ncalled and shouted, I made up my mind that I would run the risk, having law and\njustice with me, rather than take part in your injustice because I feared\nimprisonment and death. This happened in the days of the democracy. But when\nthe oligarchy of the Thirty was in power, they sent for me and four others into\nthe rotunda, and bade us bring Leon the Salaminian from Salamis, as they wanted\nto put him to death. This was a specimen of the sort of commands which they\nwere always giving with the view of implicating as many as possible in their\ncrimes; and then I showed, not in word only but in deed, that, if I may be\nallowed to use such an expression, I cared not a straw for death, and that my\ngreat and only care was lest I should do an unrighteous or unholy thing. For\nthe strong arm of that oppressive power did not frighten me into doing wrong;\nand when we came out of the rotunda the other four went to Salamis and fetched\nLeon, but I went quietly home. For which I might have lost my life, had not the\npower of the Thirty shortly afterwards come to an end. And many will witness to\nmy words.\n</p><p>\nNow do you really imagine that I could have survived all these years, if I had\nled a public life, supposing that like a good man I had always maintained the\nright and had made justice, as I ought, the first thing? No indeed, men of\nAthens, neither I nor any other man. But I have been always the same in all my\nactions, public as well as private, and never have I yielded any base\ncompliance to those who are slanderously termed my disciples, or to any other.\nNot that I have any regular disciples. But if any one likes to come and hear me\nwhile I am pursuing my mission, whether he be young or old, he is not excluded.\nNor do I converse only with those who pay; but any one, whether he be rich or\npoor, may ask and answer me and listen to my words; and whether he turns out to\nbe a bad man or a good one, neither result can be justly imputed to me; for I\nnever taught or professed to teach him anything. And if any one says that he\nhas ever learned or heard anything from me in private which all the world has\nnot heard, let me tell you that he is lying.\n</p><p>\nBut I shall be asked, Why do people delight in continually conversing with you?\nI have told you already, Athenians, the whole truth about this matter: they\nlike to hear the cross-examination of the pretenders to wisdom; there is\namusement in it. Now this duty of cross-examining other men has been imposed\nupon me by God; and has been signified to me by oracles, visions, and in every\nway in which the will of divine power was ever intimated to any one. This is\ntrue, O Athenians, or, if not true, would be soon refuted. If I am or have been\ncorrupting the youth, those of them who are now grown up and have become\nsensible that I gave them bad advice in the days of their youth should come\nforward as accusers, and take their revenge; or if they do not like to come\nthemselves, some of their relatives, fathers, brothers, or other kinsmen,\nshould say what evil their families have suffered at my hands. Now is their\ntime. Many of them I see in the court. There is Crito, who is of the same age\nand of the same deme with myself, and there is Critobulus his son, whom I also\nsee. Then again there is Lysanias of Sphettus, who is the father of\nAeschines\u2014he is present; and also there is Antiphon of Cephisus, who is\nthe father of Epigenes; and there are the brothers of several who have\nassociated with me. There is Nicostratus the son of Theosdotides, and the\nbrother of Theodotus (now Theodotus himself is dead, and therefore he, at any\nrate, will not seek to stop him); and there is Paralus the son of Demodocus,\nwho had a brother Theages; and Adeimantus the son of Ariston, whose brother\nPlato is present; and Aeantodorus, who is the brother of Apollodorus, whom I\nalso see. I might mention a great many others, some of whom Meletus should have\nproduced as witnesses in the course of his speech; and let him still produce\nthem, if he has forgotten\u2014I will make way for him. And let him say, if he\nhas any testimony of the sort which he can produce. Nay, Athenians, the very\nopposite is the truth. For all these are ready to witness on behalf of the\ncorrupter, of the injurer of their kindred, as Meletus and Anytus call me; not\nthe corrupted youth only\u2014there might have been a motive for\nthat\u2014but their uncorrupted elder relatives. Why should they too support\nme with their testimony? Why, indeed, except for the sake of truth and justice,\nand because they know that I am speaking the truth, and that Meletus is a liar.\n</p><p>\nWell, Athenians, this and the like of this is all the defence which I have to\noffer. Yet a word more. Perhaps there may be some one who is offended at me,\nwhen he calls to mind how he himself on a similar, or even a less serious\noccasion, prayed and entreated the judges with many tears, and how he produced\nhis children in court, which was a moving spectacle, together with a host of\nrelations and friends; whereas I, who am probably in danger of my life, will do\nnone of these things. The contrast may occur to his mind, and he may be set\nagainst me, and vote in anger because he is displeased at me on this account.\nNow if there be such a person among you,\u2014mind, I do not say that there\nis,\u2014to him I may fairly reply: My friend, I am a man, and like other men,\na creature of flesh and blood, and not \u201cof wood or stone,\u201d as Homer\nsays; and I have a family, yes, and sons, O Athenians, three in number, one\nalmost a man, and two others who are still young; and yet I will not bring any\nof them hither in order to petition you for an acquittal. And why not? Not from\nany self-assertion or want of respect for you. Whether I am or am not afraid of\ndeath is another question, of which I will not now speak. But, having regard to\npublic opinion, I feel that such conduct would be discreditable to myself, and\nto you, and to the whole state. One who has reached my years, and who has a\nname for wisdom, ought not to demean himself. Whether this opinion of me be\ndeserved or not, at any rate the world has decided that Socrates is in some way\nsuperior to other men. And if those among you who are said to be superior in\nwisdom and courage, and any other virtue, demean themselves in this way, how\nshameful is their conduct! I have seen men of reputation, when they have been\ncondemned, behaving in the strangest manner: they seemed to fancy that they\nwere going to suffer something dreadful if they died, and that they could be\nimmortal if you only allowed them to live; and I think that such are a\ndishonour to the state, and that any stranger coming in would have said of them\nthat the most eminent men of Athens, to whom the Athenians themselves give\nhonour and command, are no better than women. And I say that these things ought\nnot to be done by those of us who have a reputation; and if they are done, you\nought not to permit them; you ought rather to show that you are far more\ndisposed to condemn the man who gets up a doleful scene and makes the city\nridiculous, than him who holds his peace.\n</p><p>\nBut, setting aside the question of public opinion, there seems to be something\nwrong in asking a favour of a judge, and thus procuring an acquittal, instead\nof informing and convincing him. For his duty is, not to make a present of\njustice, but to give judgment; and he has sworn that he will judge according to\nthe laws, and not according to his own good pleasure; and we ought not to\nencourage you, nor should you allow yourselves to be encouraged, in this habit\nof perjury\u2014there can be no piety in that. Do not then require me to do\nwhat I consider dishonourable and impious and wrong, especially now, when I am\nbeing tried for impiety on the indictment of Meletus. For if, O men of Athens,\nby force of persuasion and entreaty I could overpower your oaths, then I should\nbe teaching you to believe that there are no gods, and in defending should\nsimply convict myself of the charge of not believing in them. But that is not\nso\u2014far otherwise. For I do believe that there are gods, and in a sense\nhigher than that in which any of my accusers believe in them. And to you and to\nGod I commit my cause, to be determined by you as is best for you and me.\n</p><hr/><p>\nThere are many reasons why I am not grieved, O men of Athens, at the vote of\ncondemnation. I expected it, and am only surprised that the votes are so nearly\nequal; for I had thought that the majority against me would have been far\nlarger; but now, had thirty votes gone over to the other side, I should have\nbeen acquitted. And I may say, I think, that I have escaped Meletus. I may say\nmore; for without the assistance of Anytus and Lycon, any one may see that he\nwould not have had a fifth part of the votes, as the law requires, in which\ncase he would have incurred a fine of a thousand drachmae.\n</p><p>\nAnd so he proposes death as the penalty. And what shall I propose on my part, O\nmen of Athens? Clearly that which is my due. And what is my due? What return\nshall be made to the man who has never had the wit to be idle during his whole\nlife; but has been careless of what the many care for\u2014wealth, and family\ninterests, and military offices, and speaking in the assembly, and\nmagistracies, and plots, and parties. Reflecting that I was really too honest a\nman to be a politician and live, I did not go where I could do no good to you\nor to myself; but where I could do the greatest good privately to every one of\nyou, thither I went, and sought to persuade every man among you that he must\nlook to himself, and seek virtue and wisdom before he looks to his private\ninterests, and look to the state before he looks to the interests of the state;\nand that this should be the order which he observes in all his actions. What\nshall be done to such an one? Doubtless some good thing, O men of Athens, if he\nhas his reward; and the good should be of a kind suitable to him. What would be\na reward suitable to a poor man who is your benefactor, and who desires leisure\nthat he may instruct you? There can be no reward so fitting as maintenance in\nthe Prytaneum, O men of Athens, a reward which he deserves far more than the\ncitizen who has won the prize at Olympia in the horse or chariot race, whether\nthe chariots were drawn by two horses or by many. For I am in want, and he has\nenough; and he only gives you the appearance of happiness, and I give you the\nreality. And if I am to estimate the penalty fairly, I should say that\nmaintenance in the Prytaneum is the just return.\n</p><p>\nPerhaps you think that I am braving you in what I am saying now, as in what I\nsaid before about the tears and prayers. But this is not so. I speak rather\nbecause I am convinced that I never intentionally wronged any one, although I\ncannot convince you\u2014the time has been too short; if there were a law at\nAthens, as there is in other cities, that a capital cause should not be decided\nin one day, then I believe that I should have convinced you. But I cannot in a\nmoment refute great slanders; and, as I am convinced that I never wronged\nanother, I will assuredly not wrong myself. I will not say of myself that I\ndeserve any evil, or propose any penalty. Why should I? because I am afraid of\nthe penalty of death which Meletus proposes? When I do not know whether death\nis a good or an evil, why should I propose a penalty which would certainly be\nan evil? Shall I say imprisonment? And why should I live in prison, and be the\nslave of the magistrates of the year\u2014of the Eleven? Or shall the penalty\nbe a fine, and imprisonment until the fine is paid? There is the same\nobjection. I should have to lie in prison, for money I have none, and cannot\npay. And if I say exile (and this may possibly be the penalty which you will\naffix), I must indeed be blinded by the love of life, if I am so irrational as\nto expect that when you, who are my own citizens, cannot endure my discourses\nand words, and have found them so grievous and odious that you will have no\nmore of them, others are likely to endure me. No indeed, men of Athens, that is\nnot very likely. And what a life should I lead, at my age, wandering from city\nto city, ever changing my place of exile, and always being driven out! For I am\nquite sure that wherever I go, there, as here, the young men will flock to me;\nand if I drive them away, their elders will drive me out at their request; and\nif I let them come, their fathers and friends will drive me out for their\nsakes.\n</p><p>\nSome one will say: Yes, Socrates, but cannot you hold your tongue, and then you\nmay go into a foreign city, and no one will interfere with you? Now I have\ngreat difficulty in making you understand my answer to this. For if I tell you\nthat to do as you say would be a disobedience to the God, and therefore that I\ncannot hold my tongue, you will not believe that I am serious; and if I say\nagain that daily to discourse about virtue, and of those other things about\nwhich you hear me examining myself and others, is the greatest good of man, and\nthat the unexamined life is not worth living, you are still less likely to\nbelieve me. Yet I say what is true, although a thing of which it is hard for me\nto persuade you. Also, I have never been accustomed to think that I deserve to\nsuffer any harm. Had I money I might have estimated the offence at what I was\nable to pay, and not have been much the worse. But I have none, and therefore I\nmust ask you to proportion the fine to my means. Well, perhaps I could afford a\nmina, and therefore I propose that penalty: Plato, Crito, Critobulus, and\nApollodorus, my friends here, bid me say thirty min\u00e6, and they will be the\nsureties. Let thirty min\u00e6 be the penalty; for which sum they will be ample\nsecurity to you.\n</p><hr/><p>\nNot much time will be gained, O Athenians, in return for the evil name which\nyou will get from the detractors of the city, who will say that you killed\nSocrates, a wise man; for they will call me wise, even although I am not wise,\nwhen they want to reproach you. If you had waited a little while, your desire\nwould have been fulfilled in the course of nature. For I am far advanced in\nyears, as you may perceive, and not far from death. I am speaking now not to\nall of you, but only to those who have condemned me to death. And I have\nanother thing to say to them: you think that I was convicted because I had no\nwords of the sort which would have procured my acquittal\u2014I mean, if I had\nthought fit to leave nothing undone or unsaid. Not so; the deficiency which led\nto my conviction was not of words\u2014certainly not. But I had not the\nboldness or impudence or inclination to address you as you would have liked me\nto do, weeping and wailing and lamenting, and saying and doing many things\nwhich you have been accustomed to hear from others, and which, as I maintain,\nare unworthy of me. I thought at the time that I ought not to do anything\ncommon or mean when in danger: nor do I now repent of the style of my defence;\nI would rather die having spoken after my manner, than speak in your manner and\nlive. For neither in war nor yet at law ought I or any man to use every way of\nescaping death. Often in battle there can be no doubt that if a man will throw\naway his arms, and fall on his knees before his pursuers, he may escape death;\nand in other dangers there are other ways of escaping death, if a man is\nwilling to say and do anything. The difficulty, my friends, is not to avoid\ndeath, but to avoid unrighteousness; for that runs faster than death. I am old\nand move slowly, and the slower runner has overtaken me, and my accusers are\nkeen and quick, and the faster runner, who is unrighteousness, has overtaken\nthem. And now I depart hence condemned by you to suffer the penalty of\ndeath,\u2014they too go their ways condemned by the truth to suffer the\npenalty of villainy and wrong; and I must abide by my award\u2014let them\nabide by theirs. I suppose that these things may be regarded as\nfated,\u2014and I think that they are well.\n</p><p>\nAnd now, O men who have condemned me, I would fain prophesy to you; for I am\nabout to die, and in the hour of death men are gifted with prophetic power. And\nI prophesy to you who are my murderers, that immediately after my departure\npunishment far heavier than you have inflicted on me will surely await you. Me\nyou have killed because you wanted to escape the accuser, and not to give an\naccount of your lives. But that will not be as you suppose: far otherwise. For\nI say that there will be more accusers of you than there are now; accusers whom\nhitherto I have restrained: and as they are younger they will be more\ninconsiderate with you, and you will be more offended at them. If you think\nthat by killing men you can prevent some one from censuring your evil lives,\nyou are mistaken; that is not a way of escape which is either possible or\nhonourable; the easiest and the noblest way is not to be disabling others, but\nto be improving yourselves. This is the prophecy which I utter before my\ndeparture to the judges who have condemned me.\n</p><p>\nFriends, who would have acquitted me, I would like also to talk with you about\nthe thing which has come to pass, while the magistrates are busy, and before I\ngo to the place at which I must die. Stay then a little, for we may as well\ntalk with one another while there is time. You are my friends, and I should\nlike to show you the meaning of this event which has happened to me. O my\njudges\u2014for you I may truly call judges\u2014I should like to tell you of\na wonderful circumstance. Hitherto the divine faculty of which the internal\noracle is the source has constantly been in the habit of opposing me even about\ntrifles, if I was going to make a slip or error in any matter; and now as you\nsee there has come upon me that which may be thought, and is generally believed\nto be, the last and worst evil. But the oracle made no sign of opposition,\neither when I was leaving my house in the morning, or when I was on my way to\nthe court, or while I was speaking, at anything which I was going to say; and\nyet I have often been stopped in the middle of a speech, but now in nothing I\neither said or did touching the matter in hand has the oracle opposed me. What\ndo I take to be the explanation of this silence? I will tell you. It is an\nintimation that what has happened to me is a good, and that those of us who\nthink that death is an evil are in error. For the customary sign would surely\nhave opposed me had I been going to evil and not to good.\n</p><p>\nLet us reflect in another way, and we shall see that there is great reason to\nhope that death is a good; for one of two things\u2014either death is a state\nof nothingness and utter unconsciousness, or, as men say, there is a change and\nmigration of the soul from this world to another. Now if you suppose that there\nis no consciousness, but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even\nby dreams, death will be an unspeakable gain. For if a person were to select\nthe night in which his sleep was undisturbed even by dreams, and were to\ncompare with this the other days and nights of his life, and then were to tell\nus how many days and nights he had passed in the course of his life better and\nmore pleasantly than this one, I think that any man, I will not say a private\nman, but even the great king will not find many such days or nights, when\ncompared with the others. Now if death be of such a nature, I say that to die\nis gain; for eternity is then only a single night. But if death is the journey\nto another place, and there, as men say, all the dead abide, what good, O my\nfriends and judges, can be greater than this? If indeed when the pilgrim\narrives in the world below, he is delivered from the professors of justice in\nthis world, and finds the true judges who are said to give judgment there,\nMinos and Rhadamanthus and Aeacus and Triptolemus, and other sons of God who\nwere righteous in their own life, that pilgrimage will be worth making. What\nwould not a man give if he might converse with Orpheus and Musaeus and Hesiod\nand Homer? Nay, if this be true, let me die again and again. I myself, too,\nshall have a wonderful interest in there meeting and conversing with Palamedes,\nand Ajax the son of Telamon, and any other ancient hero who has suffered death\nthrough an unjust judgment; and there will be no small pleasure, as I think, in\ncomparing my own sufferings with theirs. Above all, I shall then be able to\ncontinue my search into true and false knowledge; as in this world, so also in\nthe next; and I shall find out who is wise, and who pretends to be wise, and is\nnot. What would not a man give, O judges, to be able to examine the leader of\nthe great Trojan expedition; or Odysseus or Sisyphus, or numberless others, men\nand women too! What infinite delight would there be in conversing with them and\nasking them questions! In another world they do not put a man to death for\nasking questions: assuredly not. For besides being happier than we are, they\nwill be immortal, if what is said is true.\n</p><p>\nWherefore, O judges, be of good cheer about death, and know of a certainty,\nthat no evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death. He and\nhis are not neglected by the gods; nor has my own approaching end happened by\nmere chance. But I see clearly that the time had arrived when it was better for\nme to die and be released from trouble; wherefore the oracle gave no sign. For\nwhich reason, also, I am not angry with my condemners, or with my accusers;\nthey have done me no harm, although they did not mean to do me any good; and\nfor this I may gently blame them.\n</p><p>\nStill I have a favour to ask of them. When my sons are grown up, I would ask\nyou, O my friends, to punish them; and I would have you trouble them, as I have\ntroubled you, if they seem to care about riches, or anything, more than about\nvirtue; or if they pretend to be something when they are really\nnothing,\u2014then reprove them, as I have reproved you, for not caring about\nthat for which they ought to care, and thinking that they are something when\nthey are really nothing. And if you do this, both I and my sons will have\nreceived justice at your hands.\n</p><p>\nThe hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways\u2014I to die, and you\nto live. Which is better God only knows.\n</p><p><!--end chapter-->\n</p><pre></pre>"}, "body": {"chap01": {"1": {"elem_num": 1, "sec_par_num": 1, "type": "text", "sentences": ["In what relation the \u201cApology\u201d of Plato stands to the real defence of Socrates, there are no means of determining.", "It certainly agrees in tone and character with the description of Xenophon, who says in the \u201cMemorabilia\u201d that Socrates might have been acquitted \u201cif in any moderate degree he would have conciliated the favour of the dicasts;\u201d and who informs us in another passage, on the testimony of Hermogenes, the friend of Socrates, that he had no wish to live;
