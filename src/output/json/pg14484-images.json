Thus encouraged, I completed the\ntranslation of the seven plays, which was published by\nKegan Paul in 1883 and again by Murray in 1896. I\nhave now to thank Mr. Murray for consenting to this\ncheaper issue.</p><i>Antigone</i><a class=\"fnref pginternal\" href=\"#Pref1_fn_1\">[1]</a><p>The seven extant plays of Sophocles have been\nvariously arranged. In the order most frequently\nadopted by English editors, the three plays of the\nTheban cycle, Oedipus Tyrannus, Oedipus Coloneus,\nand Antigone, have been placed foremost.</p><p>In one respect this is obviously convenient, as appearing\nto present continuously a connected story.\nBut on a closer view, it is in two ways illusory.</p><p>1. The Antigone is generally admitted to be, comparatively\nspeaking, an early play, while the Oedipus\nColoneus belongs to the dramatist\u2019s latest manner;\nthe first Oedipus coming in somewhere between the\ntwo. The effect is therefore analogous to that produced\non readers of Shakespeare by the habit of placing\nHenry VI after Henry IV and V. But tragedies and\n\u2018histories\u2019 or chronicle plays are not <i>in pari materia</i>.</p><i>in pari materia</i><p>2. The error has been aggravated by a loose way of\nspeaking of \u2018the Theban Trilogy\u2019, a term which could\nonly be properly applicable if the three dramas had been\nproduced in the same year. I have therefore now\n<span class=\"page2\">[page xii]</span>\narranged the seven plays in an order corresponding to\nthe most probable dates of their production, viz. Antigone,\nAias, King Oedipus, Electra, Trachiniae, Philoctetes,\nand Oedipus at Colonos. A credible tradition\nrefers the Antigone to 445 B.C. The Aias appears to\nbe not much later\u2014it may even be earlier\u2014than the\nAntigone. The Philoctetes was produced in 408 B.C.,\nwhen the poet was considerably over eighty. The\nOedipus at Colonos has always been believed to be a\ncomposition of Sophocles\u2019 old age. It is said to have\nbeen produced after his death, though it may have\nbeen composed some years earlier. The tragedy of\nKing Oedipus, in which the poet\u2019s art attained its\nmaturity, is plausibly assigned to an early year of the\nPeloponnesian war (say 427 B.C.), the Trachiniae to\nabout 420 B.C. The time of the Electra is doubtful;\nbut Professor Jebb has shown that, on metrical grounds,\nit should be placed after, rather than before, King\nOedipus. Even the English reader, taking the plays\nas they are grouped in this volume, may be aware of\na gradual change of manner, not unlike what is perceptible\nin passing from Richard II to Macbeth, and from\nMacbeth to The Winter\u2019s Tale or Cymbeline. For\nalthough the supposed date of the Antigone was long\nsubsequent to the poet\u2019s first tragic victory, the forty\nyears over which the seven plays are spread saw many\nchanges of taste in art and literature.</p><span class=\"page2\">[page xii]</span><p class=\"left\">Footnote</p><ol>\n<li id=\"Pref1_fn_1\"><i>Three Plays of Sophocles:</i> Blackwood, 1873.</li>\n</ol><li id=\"Pref1_fn_1\"><i>Three Plays of Sophocles:</i> Blackwood, 1873.</li><i>Three Plays of Sophocles:</i><hr class=\"major\"/><div><span class=\"page2\" id=\"pg_xiii\">[page xiii]</span></div>", "pg_xiii": "<span class=\"page2\" id=\"pg_xiii\">[page xiii]</span><h2>PREFATORY NOTE TO THE EDITION OF 1883</h2><p>I. The Hellenic spirit has been repeatedly characterized\nas simple Nature-worship. Even the Higher\nPaganism has been described as \u2018in other words the\npurified worship of natural forms.\u2019<a class=\"fnref pginternal\" href=\"#Pref2_fn_1\">[1]</a> One might suppose,\nin reading some modern writers, that the Nymphs\nand Fauns, the River-Gods and Pan, were at least as\nprominent in all Greek poetry as Zeus, Apollo, and\nAthena, or that Apollo was only the sweet singer and\nnot also the prophet of retribution.</p><a class=\"fnref pginternal\" href=\"#Pref2_fn_1\">[1]</a><p>The fresh and unimpaired enjoyment of the Beautiful\nis certainly the aspect of ancient life and literature\nwhich most attracted the humanists of the sixteenth\ncentury, and still most impresses those amongst ourselves\nwho for various reasons desire to point the contrast\nbetween Paganism and Judaism. The two great\ngroups of forces vaguely known as the Renaissance and\nthe Revolution have both contributed to this result.\nMen who were weary of conventionality and of the\nweight of custom \u2018heavy as frost and deep almost as\nlife,\u2019 have longed for the vision of \u2018Oread or Dryad\nglancing through the shade,\u2019 or to \u2018hear old Triton\nblow his wreath\u00e8d horn.\u2019 Meanwhile, that in which the\nGreeks most resembled us, \u2018the human heart by which\nwe live,\u2019 for the very reason that it lies so near to us,\nis too apt to be lost from our conception of them.\nAnother cause of this one-sided view is the illusion produced\nby the contemplation of statuary, together with\nthe unapproachable perfection of form which every relic\nof Greek antiquity indisputably possesses.</p><p><span class=\"page2\">[page xiv]</span>\nBut on turning from the forms of Greek art to the\nsubstance of Greek literature, we find that Beauty,\nalthough everywhere an important element, is by no\nmeans the sole or even the chief attribute of the greatest\nwritings, nor is the Hellenic consciousness confined\nwithin the life of Nature, unless this term is allowed to\ncomprehend man with all his thoughts and aspirations.\nIt was in this latter sense that Hegel recognized the\nunion of depth with brightness in Greek culture: \u2018If\nthe first paradise was the paradise of nature, this is the\nsecond, the higher paradise of the human spirit, which\nin its fair naturalness, freedom, depth and brightness\nhere comes forth like a bride out of her chamber. The\nfirst wild majesty of the rise of spiritual life in the East\nis here circumscribed by the dignity of form, and softened\ninto beauty. Its depth shows itself no longer in confusion,\nobscurity, and inflation, but lies open before us\nin simple clearness. Its brightness (Heiterkeit) is not\na childish play, but covers a sadness which knows the\nbaldness of fate but is not by that knowledge driven out\nof freedom and measure.\u2019 Hegel\u2019s Werke, vol. XVI.\np. 139 (translated by Prof. Caird). The simplicity of\nHerodotus, for example, does not exclude far reaching\nthoughts on the political advantages of liberty, nor such\nreflections on experience as are implied in the saying\nof Artabanus, that the transitoriness of human life is\nthe least of its evils. And in what modern writing is\nmore of the wisdom of life condensed than in the History\nof Thucydides? It is surely more true to say of Greek\nliterature that it contains types of all things human,\nstamped with the freshness, simplicity, and directness\nwhich belong to first impressions, and to the first impressions\nof genius.</p><span class=\"page2\">[page xiv]</span><p>Now the \u2018thoughts and aspirations,\u2019 which are nowhere\nabsent from Greek literature, and make a centre\nof growing warmth and light in its Periclean period\u2014when\nthe conception of human nature for the first time\ntakes definite shape\u2014have no less of Religion in them\nthan underlay the \u2018creed outworn\u2019. To think otherwise\nwould be an error of the same kind as that \u2018abuse\n<span class=\"page2\">[page xv]</span>\nof the word Atheism\u2019 against which the author of the\nwork above alluded to protests so forcibly.</p><span class=\"page2\">[page xv]</span><p>Religion, in the sense here indicated, is the mainspring\nand vital principle of Tragedy. The efforts of\nAeschylus and Sophocles were sustained by it, and its\ninevitable decay through the scepticism which preceded\nSocrates was the chief hindrance to the tragic genius of\nEuripides. Yet the inequality of which we have consequently\nto complain in him is redeemed by pregnant\nhints of something yet \u2018more deeply interfused,\u2019 which\nin him, as in his two great predecessors, is sometimes\nfelt as \u2018modern,\u2019 because it is not of an age but for all\ntime. The most valuable part of every literature is\nsomething which transcends the period and nation out\nof which it springs.</p><p>On the other hand, much that at first sight seems\nprimitive in Greek tragedy belongs more to the subject\nthan to the mode of handling. The age of Pericles was\nin advance of that in which the legends were first\nHellenized and humanized, just as this must have been\nalready far removed from the earliest stages of mythopoeic\nimagination. The reader of Aeschylus or Sophocles\nshould therefore be warned against attributing to\nthe poet\u2019s invention that which is given in the fable.</p><p>An educated student of Italian painting knows how\nto discriminate\u2014say in an Assumption by Botticelli\u2014between\nthe traditional conventions, the contemporary\nideas, and the refinements of the artist\u2019s own fancy.\nThe same indulgence must be extended to dramatic art.\nThe tragedy of King Lear is not rude or primitive,\nalthough the subject belongs to prehistoric times in\nBritain. Nor is Goethe\u2019s Faust mediaeval in spirit as\nin theme. So neither is the Oedipus Rex the product\nof \u2018lawless and uncertain thoughts,\u2019 notwithstanding\nthe unspeakable horror of the story, but is penetrated\nby the most profound estimate of all in human life that\nis saddest, and all that is most precious.</p><p>Far from being naive naturalists after the Keats\n<span class=\"page2\">[page xvi]</span>\nfashion, the Greek tragic poets had succeeded to a\npessimistic reaction from simple Pagan enjoyment; they\nwere surrounded with gloomy questionings about human\ndestiny and Divine Justice, and they replied by looking\nsteadily at the facts of life and asserting the supreme\nworth of innocence, equity, and mercy.</p><span class=\"page2\">[page xvi]</span><p>They were not philosophers, for they spoke the language\nof feeling; but the civilization of which they\nwere the strongest outcome was already tinged with\ninfluences derived from early philosophy\u2014especially\nfrom the gnomic wisdom of the sixth century and from\nthe spirit of theosophic speculation, which in Aeschylus\ngoes far even to recast mythology. The latter influence\nwas probably reinforced, through channels no longer\ntraceable, by the Eleusinian worship, in which the\nmystery of life and death and of human sorrow had\nreplaced the primitive wonder at the phenomena of the\nyear.</p><p>And whatever elements of philosophic theory or\nmystic exaltation the drama may have reflected, it was\nstill more emphatically the repository of some of the\nmost precious traditions of civilized humanity\u2014traditions\nwhich philosophy has sometimes tended to extenuate,\nif not to destroy.</p><p>Plato\u2019s Gorgias contains one of the most eloquent\nvindications of the transcendent value of righteousness\nand faithfulness as such. But when we ask, \u2018Righteousness\nin what relation?\u2019\u2014\u2018Faithfulness to whom?\u2019\u2014the\nGorgias is silent; and when the vacant outline is\nfilled up in the Republic, we are presented with an ideal\nof man\u2019s social relations, which, although it may be\nregarded as the ultimate development of existing tendencies,\nyet has no immediate bearing on any actual\ncondition of the world.</p><p>The ideal of the tragic poet may be less perfect; or\nrather he does not attempt to set before us abstractedly\nany single ideal. But the grand types of character\nwhich he presents to the world are not merely imaginary.\nThey are creatures of flesh and blood, men and women,\nto whom the unsullied purity of their homes, the freedom\n<span class=\"page2\">[page xvii]</span>\nand power of their country, the respect and love\nof their fellow-citizens, are inestimably dear. From a\nPlatonic, and still more from a Christian point of view,\nthe best morality of the age of Pericles is no doubt\ndefective. Such counsels of perfection as \u2018Love your\nenemies\u2019, or \u2018A good man can harm no one, not even\nan enemy\u2019,\u2014are beyond the horizon of tragedy, unless\ndimly seen in the person of Antigone. The coexistence\nof savage vindictiveness with the most affectionate tenderness\nis characteristic of heroes and heroines alike, and\nproduces some of the most moving contrasts. But the\ntenderness is no less deep and real for this, and while\nthe chief persons are thus passionate, the Greek lesson\nof moderation and reasonableness is taught by the\nevent, whether expressed or not by the mouth of sage\nor prophet or of the \u2018ideal bystander\u2019.</p><span class=\"page2\">[page xvii]</span><p>Greek tragedy, then, is a religious art, not merely\nbecause associated with the festival of Dionysus, nor\nbecause the life which it represented was that of men\nwho believed, with all the Hellenes, in Zeus, Apollo,\nand Athena, or in the power of Moira and the Erinyes,\u2014not\nmerely because it represented</p><div class=\"poem\"><span class=\"i3\">\u2018the dread strife<br/></span>\n<span>Of poor humanity\u2019s afflicted will<br/></span>\n<span>Struggling in vain with ruthless destiny,\u2019<br/></span></div><span class=\"i3\">\u2018the dread strife<br/></span><br/><span>Of poor humanity\u2019s afflicted will<br/></span><br/><span>Struggling in vain with ruthless destiny,\u2019<br/></span><br/><p>but much more because it awakened in the Athenian\nspectator emotions of wonder concerning human life,\nand of admiration for nobleness in the unfortunate\u2014a\nsense of the infinite value of personal uprightness and\nof domestic purity\u2014which in the most universal sense\nof the word were truly religious,\u2014because it expressed\na consciousness of depths which Plato never fathomed,\nand an ideal of character which, if less complete than\nShakespeare\u2019s, is not less noble. It is indeed a \u2018rough\u2019\ngeneralization that ranks the Agamemnon with the\nAdoniazusae as a religious composition.</p><p>II. This spiritual side of tragic poetry deserves to be\nemphasized both as the most essential aspect of it, and\nas giving it the most permanent claim to lasting recognition.\n<span class=\"page2\">[page xviii]</span>\nAnd yet, apart from this, merely as dramas,\nthe works of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides will\nnever cease to be admired. These poets are teachers,\nbut they teach through art. To ask simply, as Carlyle\nonce did, \u2018What did they think?\u2019 is not the way to\nunderstand or learn from them.</p><span class=\"page2\">[page xviii]</span><p>Considered simply as works of art, the plays of\nSophocles stand alone amongst dramatic writings in\ntheir degree of concentration and complex unity.</p><p>1. The interest of a Sophoclean drama is always intensely\npersonal, and is almost always centred in an\nindividual destiny. In other words, it is not historical\nor mythical, but ethical. Single persons stand out\nmagnificently in Aeschylus. But the action is always\nlarger than any single life. Each tragedy or trilogy\nresembles the fragment of a sublime Epic poem. Mighty\nissues revolve about the scene, whether this is laid on\nEarth or amongst the Gods, issues far transcending\nthe fate of Orestes or even of Prometheus. In the perspective\npainting of Sophocles, these vast surroundings\nfall into the background, and the feelings of the spectator\nare absorbed in sympathy with the chief figure\non the stage, round whom the other characters\u2014the\nmembers of the chorus being included\u2014are grouped\nwith the minutest care.</p><p>2. In this grouping of the persons, as well as in the\nconduct of the action, Sophocles is masterly in his use\nof pathetic contrast. This motive must of course enter\ninto all tragedy\u2014nothing can be finer than the contrast\nof Cassandra to Clytemnestra in the Agamemnon,\u2014but\nin Sophocles it is all-pervading, and some of the minor\neffects of it are so subtle that although inevitably felt\nby the spectator they are often lost upon the mere\nreader or student. And every touch, however transient,\nis made to contribute to the main effect.</p><p>To recur once more to the much-abused analogy of\nstatuary:\u2014the work of Aeschylus may be compared to\na colossal frieze, while that of Sophocles resembles the\npediment of a smaller temple. Or if, as in considering\nthe Orestean trilogy, the arrangement of the pediment\n<span class=\"page2\">[page xix]</span>\naffords the more fitting parallel even for Aeschylus, yet\nthe forms are so gigantic that minute touches of characterization\nand of contrast are omitted as superfluous.\nWhereas in Sophocles, it is at once the finish of the chief\nfigure and the studied harmony of the whole, which\nhave led his work to be compared with that of his\ncontemporary Phidias. Such comparison, however, is\nuseful by way of illustration merely. It must never be\nforgotten that, as Lessing pointed out to some who\nthought the Philoctetes too sensational, analogies between\nthe arts are limited by essential differences of\nmaterial and of scope. All poetry represents successive\nmoments. Its figures are never in repose. And although\nthe action of Tragedy is concentrated and revolves\naround a single point, yet it is a dull vision that confounds\nrapidity of motion with rest.</p><span class=\"page2\">[page xix]</span><p>3. Sophocles found the subjects of his dramas already\nembodied not only in previous tragedies but in Epic and\nLyric poetry. And there were some fables, such as that\nof the death of Oedipus at Colonos, which seem to have\nbeen known to him only through oral tradition. For\nsome reason which is not clearly apparent, both he and\nAeschylus drew more largely from the Cyclic poets than\nfrom \u2018our Homer\u2019. The inferior and more recent Epics,\nwhich are now lost, were probably more episodical, and\nthus presented a more inviting repertory of legends than\nthe Iliad and Odyssey.</p><p>Arctinus of Lesbos had treated at great length the\nstory of the House of Thebes. The legend of Orestes,\nto which there are several allusions, not always consistent\nwith each other, in the Homeric poems, had been\na favourite and fruitful subject of tradition and of\npoetical treatment in the intervening period. Passages\nof the Tale of Troy, in which other heroes than Achilles\nhad the pre-eminence, had been elaborated by Lesches\nand other Epic writers of the Post-Homeric time. The\nvoyage of the Argonauts, another favourite heroic\ntheme, supplied the subjects of many dramas which\nhave disappeared. Lastly, the taking of Oechalia by\n<span class=\"page2\">[page xx]</span>\nHeracles, and the events which followed it, had been\nnarrated in a long poem, in which one version of that\nhero\u2019s multiform legend was fully set forth.</p><span class=\"page2\">[page xx]</span><p>The subjects of the King Oedipus, Oedipus at\nColonos, and Antigone, are taken from the Tale of\nThebes, the Aias and the Philoctetes are founded on\nincidents between the end of the Iliad and the taking\nof Troy, the Electra represents the vengeance of\nOrestes, the crowning event in the tale of \u2018Pelops\u2019\nline\u2019, the Trachiniae recounts the last crisis in the life\nof Heracles.</p><p>4. Of the three Theban plays, the Antigone was first\ncomposed, although its subject is the latest. Aeschylus\nin the Seven against Thebes had already represented\nthe young heroine as defying the victorious citizens who\nforbade the burial of her brother, the rebel Polynices.\nHe allowed her to be supported in her action by a band\nof sympathizing friends. But in the play of Sophocles\nshe stands alone, and the power which she defies is not\nthat of the citizens generally, but of Creon, whose will\nis absolute in the State. Thus the struggle is intensified,\nand both her strength and her desolation become more\nimpressive, while the opposing claims of civic authority\nand domestic piety are more vividly realized, because\neither is separately embodied in an individual will. By\nthe same means the situation is humanized to the last\ndegree, and the heart of the spectator, although strained\nto the uttermost with pity for the heroic maiden whose\nlife when full of brightest hopes was sacrificed to affection\nand piety, has still some feeling left for the living\ndesolation of the man, whose patriotic zeal, degenerating\ninto tyranny, brought his city to the brink of ruin,\nand cost him the lives of his two sons and of his wife,\nwhose dying curse, as well as that of Haemon, is denounced\nupon him.</p><p>In the Oedipus Tyrannus, Sophocles goes back to the\ncentral crisis of the Theban story. And again he fixes\nour attention, not so much on the fortunes of the city,\nor of the reigning house, as on the man Oedipus, his\nglory and his fall.\u2014</p><p><span class=\"page2\">[page xxi]</span></p><span class=\"page2\">[page xxi]</span><div class=\"poem\"><span>\u2018O mirror of our fickle state<br/></span>\n<span>Since man on earth unparalleled!<br/></span>\n<span>The rarer thy example stands,<br/></span>\n<span>By how much from the top of wondrous glory,<br/></span>\n<span>Strongest of mortal men,<br/></span>\n<span>To lowest pitch of abject fortune thou art fallen<a class=\"fnref pginternal\" href=\"#Pref2_fn_2\">[2]</a>.<br/></span></div><span>\u2018O mirror of our fickle state<br/></span><br/><span>Since man on earth unparalleled!<br/></span><br/><span>The rarer thy example stands,<br/></span><br/><span>By how much from the top of wondrous glory,<br/></span><br/><span>Strongest of mortal men,<br/></span><br/><span>To lowest pitch of abject fortune thou art fallen<a class=\"fnref pginternal\" href=\"#Pref2_fn_2\">[2]</a>.<br/></span><a class=\"fnref pginternal\" href=\"#Pref2_fn_2\">[2]</a><br/><p>The horror and the pity of it are both enhanced by\nthe character of Oedipus\u2014his essential innocence, his\naffectionateness, his uncalculating benevolence and\npublic spirit;\u2014while his impetuosity and passionateness\nmake the sequel less incredible.</p><p>The essential innocence of Oedipus, which survives\nthe ruin of his hopes in this world, supplies the chief\nmotive of the Oedipus at Colonos. This drama, which\nSophocles is said to have written late in life, is in many\nways contrasted with the former Oedipus. It begins\nwith pity and horror, and ends with peace. It is only\nin part founded on Epic tradition, the main incident\nbelonging apparently to the local mythology of the\npoet\u2019s birthplace. It also implies a later stage of ethical\nreflection, and in this respect resembles the Philoctetes;\nit depends more on lyrical and melodramatic effects,\nand allows more room for collateral and subsidiary\nmotives than any other of the seven. Yet in its principal\ntheme, the vindication or redemption of an essentially\nnoble spirit from the consequences of error, it\nrepeats a note which had been struck much earlier in the\nAias with great force, although with some crudities of\ntreatment which are absent from the later drama.</p><p>5. In one of the Epic poems which narrated the fall of\nTroy, the figure of Aias was more prominent than in the\nIliad. He alone and unassisted was there said to have\nrepulsed Hector from the ships, and he had the chief\nshare, although in this he was aided by Odysseus, in\nrescuing the dead body of Achilles. Yet Achilles\u2019\narms were awarded by the votes of the chieftains, as the\nprize of valour, not to Aias, but to Odysseus. This, no\ndoubt, meant that wisdom is better than strength. But\n<span class=\"page2\">[page xxii]</span>\nthe wisdom of Odysseus in these later Epics was often\nless nobly esteemed than in the Iliad and Odyssey, and\nwas represented as alloyed with cunning.</p><span class=\"page2\">[page xxii]</span><p>Aias has withdrawn with his Salaminians, in a rage,\nfrom the fight, and after long brooding by the ships his\nwrath has broken forth into a blaze which would have\nendangered the lives of Odysseus and the Atridae, had\nnot Athena in her care for them changed his anger into\nmadness. Hence, instead of slaying the generals, he\nmakes havoc amongst the flocks and herds, which as\nthe result of various forays were the common property\nof the whole army. The truth is discovered by Odysseus\nwith the help of Athena, and from being next to\nAchilles in renown, Aias becomes the object of universal\nscorn and hatred. The sequel of this hour of his downfall\nis the subject of the Aias of Sophocles. After\nlamenting his fate, the hero eludes the vigilance of his\ncaptive bride Tecmessa, and of his Salaminian mariners,\nand, in complete solitude, falls upon his sword. He is\nfound by Tecmessa and by his half-brother Teucer, who\nhas returned too late from a raid in the Mysian highlands.\nThe Atridae would prohibit Aias\u2019 funeral; but Odysseus,\nwho has been specially enlightened by Athena,\nadvises generous forbearance, and his counsel prevails.\nThe part representing the disgrace and death of Aias is\nmore affecting to modern readers than the remainder of\nthe drama. But we should bear in mind that the vindication\nof Aias after death, and his burial with undiminished\nhonours, had an absorbing interest for the\nAthenian and Salaminian spectator.</p><p>Philoctetes also is rejected by man and accepted by\nDestiny. The Argives in his case, as the Thebans in\nthe case of Oedipus, are blind to the real intentions of\nthe Gods.</p><p>The Philoctetes, like the Oedipus at Colonos, was a\nwork of Sophocles\u2019 old age; and while it can hardly be\nsaid that the fire of tragic feeling is abated in either of\nthese plays, dramatic effect is modified in both of them\nby the influence of the poet\u2019s contemplative mood. The\ninterest of the action in the Philoctetes is more inward\n<span class=\"page2\">[page xxiii]</span>\nand psychological than in any other ancient drama.\nThe change of mind in Neoptolemus, the stubborn fixity\nof will in Philoctetes, contrasted with the confiding\ntenderness of his nature, form the elements of a dramatic\nmovement at once extremely simple and wonderfully\nsustained. No purer ideal of virtuous youth has\nbeen imagined than the son of Achilles, who in this play,\nthough sorely tempted, sets faithfulness before ambition.</p><span class=\"page2\">[page xxiii]</span><p>6. In the Electra, which, though much earlier than the\nPhiloctetes, is still a work of his mature genius, our poet\nappears at first sight to be in unequal competition with\nAeschylus. If the Theban trilogy of the elder poet had\nremained entire, a similar impression might have been\nproduced by the Oedipus Tyrannus. It is best to lay\nsuch comparisons aside, and to consider the work of\nSophocles simply on its own merits. The subject, as\nhe has chosen to treat it, is the heroic endurance of a\nwoman who devotes her life to the vindication of intolerable\nwrongs done to her father, and the restoration\nof her young brother to his hereditary rights. Hers is\nthe human agency which for this purpose works together\nwith Apollo. But the divine intention is concealed\nfrom her. She suffers countless indignities from\nher father\u2019s enemies, of whom her own mother is the\nchief. And, at length, all her hopes are shattered by\nthe false tidings that Orestes is no more.

And it is a superficial\njudgement which complains that here at all events our\nsympathies are distracted between the two chief persons,\nD\u00eaanira and Heracles. To one passion of his, to one\nfond mistake of hers, the ruin of them both is due. Her\nlove has made their fates inseparable.

There is much to be said for\nthe view of an eminent scholar who once declared that\nhe would never think of translating a Greek poet. But\nthe end of translating is not to satisfy fastidious\nscholars, but to make the classics partially accessible to\nthose whose acquaintance with them would otherwise\nbe still more defective. Part of this version of Sophocles\nwas printed several years ago in an imperfect form.\nThe present volume contains the seven extant plays\nentire. As the object has been to give the effect of\neach drama as a whole, rather than to dwell on particular\n\u2018beauties\u2019 (which only a poet can render), the fragments\nhave not been included. But the reader should\n<span class=\"page2\">[page xxvii]</span>\nbear in mind that the seven plays are less than a tithe\nof the work produced by the poet in his lifetime.</p><span class=\"page2\">[page xxvii]</span><p>It may very possibly be asked why verse has been\nemployed at all. Why not have listened to Carlyle\u2019s\nrough demand, \u2018Tell us what they thought; none of\nyour silly poetry\u2019? The present translator can only\nreply that he began with prose, but soon found that, for\ntragic dialogue in English, blank verse appeared a more\nnatural and effective vehicle than any prose style which\nhe could hope to frame. And with the dialogue in\nverse, it was impossible to have the lyric parts in any\nsort of prose, simply because the reader would then have\nfelt an intolerable incongruity. These parts have therefore\nbeen turned into such familiar lyric measures as\nseemed at once possible and not unsuitable. And\nwhere this method was found impracticable, as sometimes\nin the <i>Commoi</i>, blank metres have again been\nused,\u2014with such liberties as seemed appropriate to the\nspecial purpose. The writer\u2019s hope throughout has\nbeen, not indeed fully to transfuse the poetry of Sophocles\ninto another tongue, but to make the poet\u2019s dramatic\nintention to be understood and felt by English\nreaders. One more such endeavour may possibly find\nacceptance at a time when many causes have combined\nto awaken a fresh interest at once in dramatic literature\nand in Hellenic studies.</p><i>Commoi</i><p>The reader who is hitherto unacquainted with the\nGreek drama, should be warned that the parts assigned\nto the \u2018Chorus\u2019 were often distributed among its\nseveral members, who spoke or chanted, singly or in\ngroups, alternately or in succession.

When\nhe grew up he was troubled by a rumour that he was not\nhis father\u2019s son. He went to consult the oracle of Apollo\nat Delphi, and was told\u2014not of his origin but of his destiny\u2014that\nhe should be guilty of parricide and incest.</p><p>He was too horror-stricken to return to Corinth, and as\nhe travelled the other way, he met Laius going from Thebes\nto Delphi. The travellers quarrelled and the son killed his\nfather, but knew not whom he had slain. He went onward\ntill he came near Thebes, where the Sphinx was\nmaking havoc of the noblest citizens, devouring all who\nfailed to solve her riddle. But Oedipus succeeded and\novercame her, and, as Laius did not return, was rewarded\nwith the regal sceptre,\u2014and with the hand of the queen.</p><p>He reigned nobly and prosperously, and lived happily\nwith Jocasta, by whom he had four children.</p><p>But after some years a plague descended on the people,\nand Apollo, on being inquired of, answered that it was for\nLaius\u2019 death.

Many years afterwards,\nwhen Heracles was returning from his last exploit of sacking\nOechalia, in Euboea, he sent before him, by his herald\nLichas, Iole, the king\u2019s daughter, whom he had espoused.\nDeanira, when she had discovered this, commissioned\nLichas when he returned to present his master with a robe,\nwhich she had anointed with the charm,\u2014hoping by this\nmeans to regain her lord\u2019s affection. But the poison of\nthe Hydra did its work, and Heracles died in agony, Deanira\nhaving already killed herself on ascertaining what she had\ndone. The action takes place in Trachis, near the Mahae\nGulf, where Heracles and Deanira, by permission of Ceyx,\nthe king of the country, have been living in exile. At the\nclose of the drama, Heracles, while yet alive, is carried\ntowards his pyre on Mount Oeta.</p><p><span class=\"page2\">[page 177]</span></p><span class=\"page2\">[page 177]</span><h3>THE TRACHINIAN MAIDENS</h3><p class=\"dlg\"><span class=\"in2\"><span class=\"cnm\">D\u00caANIRA.</span>\nMen say,\u2014\u2019twas old experience gave the word,</span><br/>\n\u2014\u2018No lot of mortal, ere he die, can once<br/>\nBe known for good or evil.\u2019 But I know,<br/>\nBefore I come to the dark dwelling-place,<br/>\nMine is a lot, adverse and hard and sore.<br/>\nWho yet at Pleuron, in my father\u2019s home,<br/>\nOf all Aetolian women had most cause<br/>\nTo fear my bridal.

But by-and-by\nambition prevailed with Eteocles, the younger-born, and\nhe persuaded Creon and the citizens to banish his elder\nbrother. Polynices took refuge at Argos, where he\nmarried the daughter of Adrastus, and levied an army of\nauxiliaries to support his pretensions to the throne of\nThebes.

But hard it is to learn The mind of any mortal or the heart, Till he be tried in chief authority. Power shows the man. For he who when supreme Withholds his hand or voice from the best cause, Being thwarted by some fear, that man to me Appears, and ever hath appeared, most vile. He too hath no high place in mine esteem, Who sets his friend before his fatherland. Let Zeus whose eye sees all eternally Be here my witness. I will ne\u2019er keep silence When danger lours upon my citizens Who looked for safety, nor make him my friend Who doth not love my country. For I know Our country carries us, and whilst her helm Is held aright we gain good friends and true.

But come, Unveil. Let me behold my misery. [The corpse of AIAS is uncovered O sight unbearable! Cruelly brave! Dying, what store of griefs thou sow\u2019st for me! Where, amongst whom of mortals, can I go, That stood not near thee in thy troublous hour? Will Telamon, my sire and thine, receive me With radiant countenance and favouring brow [page 71][1010-1046] Returning without thee? Most like! being one Who smiles no more, yield Fortune what she may. Will he hide aught or soften any word, Rating the bastard of his spear-won thrall, Whose cowardice and dastardy betrayed Thy life, dear Aias,\u2014or my murderous guile, To rob thee of thy lordship and thy home? Such greeting waits me from the man of wrath, Whose testy age even without cause would storm. Last, I shall leave my land a castaway, Thrust forth an exile, and proclaimed a slave; So should I fare at home. And here in Troy My foes are many and my comforts few. All these things are my portion through thy death. Woe\u2019s me, my heart! how shall I bear to draw thee, O thou ill-starr\u2019d! from this discoloured blade, Thy self-shown slayer? Didst thou then perceive Dead Hector was at length to be thine end?\u2014 I pray you all, consider these two men. Hector, whose gift from Aias was a girdle, Tight-braced therewith to the car\u2019s rim, was dragged And scarified till he breathed forth his life. And Aias with this present from his foe Finds through such means his death-fall and his doom. Say then what cruel workman forged the gifts, But Fury this sharp sword, Hell that bright band? In this, and all things human, I maintain, Gods are the artificers. My thought is said.

For at a feasting once over the wine One deep in liquor called aloud to me, \u2018Hail, thou false foundling of a foster-sire!\u2019 That day with pain I held my passion down; But early on the morrow I came near And questioned both my parents, who were fierce [page 107][784-820] In anger at the man who broached this word. For their part I was satisfied, but still It galled me, for the rumour would not die. Eluding then my parents I made way To Delphi, where, as touching my desire, Phoebus denied me; but brake forth instead With other oracles of misery And horrible misfortune, how that I Must know my mother\u2019s shame, and cause to appear A birth intolerable in human view, And do to death the author of my life. I fled forth at the word, conjecturing now Corinthia\u2019s region by the stars of heaven, And wandered, where I never might behold Those dreadful prophecies fulfilled on me. So travelling on, I came even to the place Where, as thou tell\u2019st, the King of Theb\u00e8 fell. And, O my wife, I will hide nought from thee. When I drew near the cross-road of your tale, A herald, and a man upon a car, Like your description, there encountered me. And he who led the car, and he himself The greybeard, sought to thrust me from the path. Then in mine angry mood I sharply struck The driver-man who turned me from the way; Which when the elder saw, he watched for me As I passed by, and from the chariot-seat Smote full upon my head with the fork\u2019d goad; But got more than he gave; for, by a blow From this right hand, smit with my staff, he fell Instantly rolled out of the car supine. I slew them every one. Now if that stranger Had aught in common with king Laius, What wretch on earth was e\u2019er so lost as I? Whom have the Heavens so followed with their hate? No house of Theban or of foreigner Must any more receive me, none henceforth Must speak to me, but drive me from the door! I, I have laid this curse on mine own head! [page 108][821-858] Yea, and this arm that slew him now enfolds His queen. O cruel stain! Am I not vile? Polluted utterly! Yes, I must flee, And, lost to Theb\u00e8, nevermore behold My home, nor tread my country, lest I meet In marriage mine own mother, and bring low His head that gave me life and reared my youth, My father, Polybus. Ah! right were he Who should declare some god of cruel mood Had sent this trouble upon my soul!

Who yet at Pleuron, in my father\u2019s home, Of all Aetolian women had most cause To fear my bridal. For a river-god, Swift Achel\u00f4\u00fcs, was my suitor there And sought me from my father in three forms; Now in his own bull-likeness, now a serpent Of coiling sheen, and now with manlike build But bovine front, while from the shadowy beard Sprang fountain-waters in perpetual spray.

For since he quelled the might of Iphitus, We here in Trachis dwell, far from our home, Dependent on a stranger, but where he Is gone, none knoweth. Only this I know, His going pierced my heart with pangs for him, And now I am all but sure he bears some woe. These fifteen months he hath sent me not one word. And I have cause for fear.

Boy, great Achilles\u2019 offspring, in this form Thou seest the man, of whom, methinks, erewhile Thou hast been told, to whom the Herc\u00falean bow Descended, Philoctetes, Poeas\u2019 son; Whom the two generals and the Ithacan king Cast out thus shamefully forlorn, afflicted With the fierce malady and desperate wound Made by the cruel basilisk\u2019s murderous tooth. With this for company they left me, child! Exposed upon this shore, deserted, lone. From seaward Chrysa came they with their fleet And touched at Lemnos. I had fallen to rest From the long tossing, in a shadowy cave On yonder cliff by the shore. Gladly they saw, And left me, having set forth for my need, [page 225][273-314] Poor man, some scanty rags, and a thin store Of provender. Such food be theirs, I pray! Imagine, O my son, when they were gone, What wakening, what arising, then was mine; What weeping, what lamenting of my woe! When I beheld the ships, wherewith I sailed, Gone, one and all! and no man in the place, None to bestead me, none to comfort me In my sore sickness. And where\u2019er I looked, Nought but distress was present with me still. No lack of that, for one thing!\u2014Ah! my son, Time passed, and there I found myself alone Within my narrow lodging, forced to serve Each pressing need. For body\u2019s sustenance This bow supplied me with sufficient store, Wounding the feathered doves, and when the shaft, From the tight string, had struck, myself, ay me! Dragging this foot, would crawl to my swift prey. Then water must be fetched, and in sharp frost Wood must be found and broken,\u2014all by me. Nor would fire come unbidden, but with flint From flints striking dim sparks, I hammered forth The struggling flame that keeps the life in me. For houseroom with the single help of fire Gives all I need, save healing for my sore. Now learn, my son, the nature of this isle. No mariner puts in here willingly. For it hath neither moorage, nor sea-port, For traffic or kind shelter or good cheer. Not hitherward do prudent men make voyage. Perchance one may have touched against his will. Many strange things may happen in long time. These, when they come, in words have pitied me, And given me food, or raiment, in compassion. But none is willing, when I speak thereof, To take me safely home. Wherefore I pine Now this tenth year, in famine and distress, Feeding the hunger of my ravenous plague.
