\section{PREFACE}
\par  In 1869, having read the Antigone with a pupil who at the time had a passion for the stage, I was led to attempt a metrical version of the Antigone, and, by and by, of the Electra and Trachiniae. [1] I had the satisfaction of seeing this last very beautifully produced by an amateur company in Scotland in 1877; when Mrs. Fleeming Jenkin may be said to have ‘created’ the part of Dêanira. Thus encouraged, I completed the translation of the seven plays, which was published by Kegan Paul in 1883 and again by Murray in 1896. I have now to thank Mr. Murray for consenting to this cheaper issue.

\par  The seven extant plays of Sophocles have been variously arranged. In the order most frequently adopted by English editors, the three plays of the Theban cycle, Oedipus Tyrannus, Oedipus Coloneus, and Antigone, have been placed foremost.

\par  In one respect this is obviously convenient, as appearing to present continuously a connected story. But on a closer view, it is in two ways illusory.

\par  1. The Antigone is generally admitted to be, comparatively speaking, an early play, while the Oedipus Coloneus belongs to the dramatist’s latest manner; the first Oedipus coming in somewhere between the two. The effect is therefore analogous to that produced on readers of Shakespeare by the habit of placing Henry VI after Henry IV and V. But tragedies and ‘histories’ or chronicle plays are not in pari materia.

\par  2. The error has been aggravated by a loose way of speaking of ‘the Theban Trilogy’, a term which could only be properly applicable if the three dramas had been produced in the same year. I have therefore now [page xii] arranged the seven plays in an order corresponding to the most probable dates of their production, viz. Antigone, Aias, King Oedipus, Electra, Trachiniae, Philoctetes, and Oedipus at Colonos. A credible tradition refers the Antigone to 445 B.C. The Aias appears to be not much later—it may even be earlier—than the Antigone. The Philoctetes was produced in 408 B.C., when the poet was considerably over eighty. The Oedipus at Colonos has always been believed to be a composition of Sophocles’ old age. It is said to have been produced after his death, though it may have been composed some years earlier. The tragedy of King Oedipus, in which the poet’s art attained its maturity, is plausibly assigned to an early year of the Peloponnesian war (say 427 B.C. ), the Trachiniae to about 420 B.C. The time of the Electra is doubtful; but Professor Jebb has shown that, on metrical grounds, it should be placed after, rather than before, King Oedipus. Even the English reader, taking the plays as they are grouped in this volume, may be aware of a gradual change of manner, not unlike what is perceptible in passing from Richard II to Macbeth, and from Macbeth to The Winter’s Tale or Cymbeline. For although the supposed date of the Antigone was long subsequent to the poet’s first tragic victory, the forty years over which the seven plays are spread saw many changes of taste in art and literature.

\section{PREFATORY NOTE TO THE EDITION OF 1883}
\par  I. The Hellenic spirit has been repeatedly characterized as simple Nature-worship. Even the Higher Paganism has been described as ‘in other words the purified worship of natural forms.’[1] One might suppose, in reading some modern writers, that the Nymphs and Fauns, the River-Gods and Pan, were at least as prominent in all Greek poetry as Zeus, Apollo, and Athena, or that Apollo was only the sweet singer and not also the prophet of retribution.

\par  The fresh and unimpaired enjoyment of the Beautiful is certainly the aspect of ancient life and literature which most attracted the humanists of the sixteenth century, and still most impresses those amongst ourselves who for various reasons desire to point the contrast between Paganism and Judaism. The two great groups of forces vaguely known as the Renaissance and the Revolution have both contributed to this result. Men who were weary of conventionality and of the weight of custom ‘heavy as frost and deep almost as life,’ have longed for the vision of ‘Oread or Dryad glancing through the shade,’ or to ‘hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.’ Meanwhile, that in which the Greeks most resembled us, ‘the human heart by which we live,’ for the very reason that it lies so near to us, is too apt to be lost from our conception of them. Another cause of this one-sided view is the illusion produced by the contemplation of statuary, together with the unapproachable perfection of form which every relic of Greek antiquity indisputably possesses.

\par  [page xiv] But on turning from the forms of Greek art to the substance of Greek literature, we find that Beauty, although everywhere an important element, is by no means the sole or even the chief attribute of the greatest writings, nor is the Hellenic consciousness confined within the life of Nature, unless this term is allowed to comprehend man with all his thoughts and aspirations. It was in this latter sense that Hegel recognized the union of depth with brightness in Greek culture: ‘If the first paradise was the paradise of nature, this is the second, the higher paradise of the human spirit, which in its fair naturalness, freedom, depth and brightness here comes forth like a bride out of her chamber. The first wild majesty of the rise of spiritual life in the East is here circumscribed by the dignity of form, and softened into beauty. Its depth shows itself no longer in confusion, obscurity, and inflation, but lies open before us in simple clearness. Its brightness (Heiterkeit) is not a childish play, but covers a sadness which knows the baldness of fate but is not by that knowledge driven out of freedom and measure.’ Hegel’s Werke, vol. XVI. p. 139 (translated by Prof. Caird). The simplicity of Herodotus, for example, does not exclude far reaching thoughts on the political advantages of liberty, nor such reflections on experience as are implied in the saying of Artabanus, that the transitoriness of human life is the least of its evils. And in what modern writing is more of the wisdom of life condensed than in the History of Thucydides? It is surely more true to say of Greek literature that it contains types of all things human, stamped with the freshness, simplicity, and directness which belong to first impressions, and to the first impressions of genius.

\par  Now the ‘thoughts and aspirations,’ which are nowhere absent from Greek literature, and make a centre of growing warmth and light in its Periclean period—when the conception of human nature for the first time takes definite shape—have no less of Religion in them than underlay the ‘creed outworn’. To think otherwise would be an error of the same kind as that ‘abuse [page xv] of the word Atheism’ against which the author of the work above alluded to protests so forcibly.

\par  Religion, in the sense here indicated, is the mainspring and vital principle of Tragedy. The efforts of Aeschylus and Sophocles were sustained by it, and its inevitable decay through the scepticism which preceded Socrates was the chief hindrance to the tragic genius of Euripides. Yet the inequality of which we have consequently to complain in him is redeemed by pregnant hints of something yet ‘more deeply interfused,’ which in him, as in his two great predecessors, is sometimes felt as ‘modern,’ because it is not of an age but for all time. The most valuable part of every literature is something which transcends the period and nation out of which it springs.

\par  On the other hand, much that at first sight seems primitive in Greek tragedy belongs more to the subject than to the mode of handling. The age of Pericles was in advance of that in which the legends were first Hellenized and humanized, just as this must have been already far removed from the earliest stages of mythopoeic imagination. The reader of Aeschylus or Sophocles should therefore be warned against attributing to the poet’s invention that which is given in the fable.

\par  An educated student of Italian painting knows how to discriminate—say in an Assumption by Botticelli—between the traditional conventions, the contemporary ideas, and the refinements of the artist’s own fancy. The same indulgence must be extended to dramatic art. The tragedy of King Lear is not rude or primitive, although the subject belongs to prehistoric times in Britain. Nor is Goethe’s Faust mediaeval in spirit as in theme. So neither is the Oedipus Rex the product of ‘lawless and uncertain thoughts,’ notwithstanding the unspeakable horror of the story, but is penetrated by the most profound estimate of all in human life that is saddest, and all that is most precious.

\par  Far from being naive naturalists after the Keats [page xvi] fashion, the Greek tragic poets had succeeded to a pessimistic reaction from simple Pagan enjoyment; they were surrounded with gloomy questionings about human destiny and Divine Justice, and they replied by looking steadily at the facts of life and asserting the supreme worth of innocence, equity, and mercy.

\par  They were not philosophers, for they spoke the language of feeling; but the civilization of which they were the strongest outcome was already tinged with influences derived from early philosophy—especially from the gnomic wisdom of the sixth century and from the spirit of theosophic speculation, which in Aeschylus goes far even to recast mythology. The latter influence was probably reinforced, through channels no longer traceable, by the Eleusinian worship, in which the mystery of life and death and of human sorrow had replaced the primitive wonder at the phenomena of the year.

\par  And whatever elements of philosophic theory or mystic exaltation the drama may have reflected, it was still more emphatically the repository of some of the most precious traditions of civilized humanity—traditions which philosophy has sometimes tended to extenuate, if not to destroy.

\par  Plato’s Gorgias contains one of the most eloquent vindications of the transcendent value of righteousness and faithfulness as such. But when we ask, ‘Righteousness in what relation?’—‘Faithfulness to whom?’—the Gorgias is silent; and when the vacant outline is filled up in the Republic, we are presented with an ideal of man’s social relations, which, although it may be regarded as the ultimate development of existing tendencies, yet has no immediate bearing on any actual condition of the world.

\par  The ideal of the tragic poet may be less perfect; or rather he does not attempt to set before us abstractedly any single ideal. But the grand types of character which he presents to the world are not merely imaginary. They are creatures of flesh and blood, men and women, to whom the unsullied purity of their homes, the freedom [page xvii] and power of their country, the respect and love of their fellow-citizens, are inestimably dear. From a Platonic, and still more from a Christian point of view, the best morality of the age of Pericles is no doubt defective. Such counsels of perfection as ‘Love your enemies’, or ‘A good man can harm no one, not even an enemy’,—are beyond the horizon of tragedy, unless dimly seen in the person of Antigone. The coexistence of savage vindictiveness with the most affectionate tenderness is characteristic of heroes and heroines alike, and produces some of the most moving contrasts. But the tenderness is no less deep and real for this, and while the chief persons are thus passionate, the Greek lesson of moderation and reasonableness is taught by the event, whether expressed or not by the mouth of sage or prophet or of the ‘ideal bystander’.

\par  Greek tragedy, then, is a religious art, not merely because associated with the festival of Dionysus, nor because the life which it represented was that of men who believed, with all the Hellenes, in Zeus, Apollo, and Athena, or in the power of Moira and the Erinyes,—not merely because it represented
 
\par  but much more because it awakened in the Athenian spectator emotions of wonder concerning human life, and of admiration for nobleness in the unfortunate—a sense of the infinite value of personal uprightness and of domestic purity—which in the most universal sense of the word were truly religious,—because it expressed a consciousness of depths which Plato never fathomed, and an ideal of character which, if less complete than Shakespeare’s, is not less noble. It is indeed a ‘rough’ generalization that ranks the Agamemnon with the Adoniazusae as a religious composition.

\par  II. This spiritual side of tragic poetry deserves to be emphasized both as the most essential aspect of it, and as giving it the most permanent claim to lasting recognition. [page xviii] And yet, apart from this, merely as dramas, the works of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides will never cease to be admired. These poets are teachers, but they teach through art. To ask simply, as Carlyle once did, ‘What did they think?’ is not the way to understand or learn from them.

\par  Considered simply as works of art, the plays of Sophocles stand alone amongst dramatic writings in their degree of concentration and complex unity.

\par  1. The interest of a Sophoclean drama is always intensely personal, and is almost always centred in an individual destiny. In other words, it is not historical or mythical, but ethical. Single persons stand out magnificently in Aeschylus. But the action is always larger than any single life. Each tragedy or trilogy resembles the fragment of a sublime Epic poem. Mighty issues revolve about the scene, whether this is laid on Earth or amongst the Gods, issues far transcending the fate of Orestes or even of Prometheus. In the perspective painting of Sophocles, these vast surroundings fall into the background, and the feelings of the spectator are absorbed in sympathy with the chief figure on the stage, round whom the other characters—the members of the chorus being included—are grouped with the minutest care.

\par  2. In this grouping of the persons, as well as in the conduct of the action, Sophocles is masterly in his use of pathetic contrast. This motive must of course enter into all tragedy—nothing can be finer than the contrast of Cassandra to Clytemnestra in the Agamemnon,—but in Sophocles it is all-pervading, and some of the minor effects of it are so subtle that although inevitably felt by the spectator they are often lost upon the mere reader or student. And every touch, however transient, is made to contribute to the main effect.

\par  To recur once more to the much-abused analogy of statuary:—the work of Aeschylus may be compared to a colossal frieze, while that of Sophocles resembles the pediment of a smaller temple. Or if, as in considering the Orestean trilogy, the arrangement of the pediment [page xix] affords the more fitting parallel even for Aeschylus, yet the forms are so gigantic that minute touches of characterization and of contrast are omitted as superfluous. Whereas in Sophocles, it is at once the finish of the chief figure and the studied harmony of the whole, which have led his work to be compared with that of his contemporary Phidias. Such comparison, however, is useful by way of illustration merely. It must never be forgotten that, as Lessing pointed out to some who thought the Philoctetes too sensational, analogies between the arts are limited by essential differences of material and of scope. All poetry represents successive moments. Its figures are never in repose. And although the action of Tragedy is concentrated and revolves around a single point, yet it is a dull vision that confounds rapidity of motion with rest.

\par  3. Sophocles found the subjects of his dramas already embodied not only in previous tragedies but in Epic and Lyric poetry. And there were some fables, such as that of the death of Oedipus at Colonos, which seem to have been known to him only through oral tradition. For some reason which is not clearly apparent, both he and Aeschylus drew more largely from the Cyclic poets than from ‘our Homer’. The inferior and more recent Epics, which are now lost, were probably more episodical, and thus presented a more inviting repertory of legends than the Iliad and Odyssey.

\par  Arctinus of Lesbos had treated at great length the story of the House of Thebes. The legend of Orestes, to which there are several allusions, not always consistent with each other, in the Homeric poems, had been a favourite and fruitful subject of tradition and of poetical treatment in the intervening period. Passages of the Tale of Troy, in which other heroes than Achilles had the pre-eminence, had been elaborated by Lesches and other Epic writers of the Post-Homeric time. The voyage of the Argonauts, another favourite heroic theme, supplied the subjects of many dramas which have disappeared. Lastly, the taking of Oechalia by [page xx] Heracles, and the events which followed it, had been narrated in a long poem, in which one version of that hero’s multiform legend was fully set forth.

\par  The subjects of the King Oedipus, Oedipus at Colonos, and Antigone, are taken from the Tale of Thebes, the Aias and the Philoctetes are founded on incidents between the end of the Iliad and the taking of Troy, the Electra represents the vengeance of Orestes, the crowning event in the tale of ‘Pelops’ line’, the Trachiniae recounts the last crisis in the life of Heracles.

\par  4. Of the three Theban plays, the Antigone was first composed, although its subject is the latest. Aeschylus in the Seven against Thebes had already represented the young heroine as defying the victorious citizens who forbade the burial of her brother, the rebel Polynices. He allowed her to be supported in her action by a band of sympathizing friends. But in the play of Sophocles she stands alone, and the power which she defies is not that of the citizens generally, but of Creon, whose will is absolute in the State. Thus the struggle is intensified, and both her strength and her desolation become more impressive, while the opposing claims of civic authority and domestic piety are more vividly realized, because either is separately embodied in an individual will. By the same means the situation is humanized to the last degree, and the heart of the spectator, although strained to the uttermost with pity for the heroic maiden whose life when full of brightest hopes was sacrificed to affection and piety, has still some feeling left for the living desolation of the man, whose patriotic zeal, degenerating into tyranny, brought his city to the brink of ruin, and cost him the lives of his two sons and of his wife, whose dying curse, as well as that of Haemon, is denounced upon him.

\par  In the Oedipus Tyrannus, Sophocles goes back to the central crisis of the Theban story. And again he fixes our attention, not so much on the fortunes of the city, or of the reigning house, as on the man Oedipus, his glory and his fall.—

\par  [page xxi]
 
\par  The horror and the pity of it are both enhanced by the character of Oedipus—his essential innocence, his affectionateness, his uncalculating benevolence and public spirit;—while his impetuosity and passionateness make the sequel less incredible.

\par  The essential innocence of Oedipus, which survives the ruin of his hopes in this world, supplies the chief motive of the Oedipus at Colonos. This drama, which Sophocles is said to have written late in life, is in many ways contrasted with the former Oedipus. It begins with pity and horror, and ends with peace. It is only in part founded on Epic tradition, the main incident belonging apparently to the local mythology of the poet’s birthplace. It also implies a later stage of ethical reflection, and in this respect resembles the Philoctetes; it depends more on lyrical and melodramatic effects, and allows more room for collateral and subsidiary motives than any other of the seven. Yet in its principal theme, the vindication or redemption of an essentially noble spirit from the consequences of error, it repeats a note which had been struck much earlier in the Aias with great force, although with some crudities of treatment which are absent from the later drama.

\par  5. In one of the Epic poems which narrated the fall of Troy, the figure of Aias was more prominent than in the Iliad. He alone and unassisted was there said to have repulsed Hector from the ships, and he had the chief share, although in this he was aided by Odysseus, in rescuing the dead body of Achilles. Yet Achilles’ arms were awarded by the votes of the chieftains, as the prize of valour, not to Aias, but to Odysseus. This, no doubt, meant that wisdom is better than strength. But [page xxii] the wisdom of Odysseus in these later Epics was often less nobly esteemed than in the Iliad and Odyssey, and was represented as alloyed with cunning.

\par  Aias has withdrawn with his Salaminians, in a rage, from the fight, and after long brooding by the ships his wrath has broken forth into a blaze which would have endangered the lives of Odysseus and the Atridae, had not Athena in her care for them changed his anger into madness. Hence, instead of slaying the generals, he makes havoc amongst the flocks and herds, which as the result of various forays were the common property of the whole army. The truth is discovered by Odysseus with the help of Athena, and from being next to Achilles in renown, Aias becomes the object of universal scorn and hatred. The sequel of this hour of his downfall is the subject of the Aias of Sophocles. After lamenting his fate, the hero eludes the vigilance of his captive bride Tecmessa, and of his Salaminian mariners, and, in complete solitude, falls upon his sword. He is found by Tecmessa and by his half-brother Teucer, who has returned too late from a raid in the Mysian highlands. The Atridae would prohibit Aias’ funeral; but Odysseus, who has been specially enlightened by Athena, advises generous forbearance, and his counsel prevails. The part representing the disgrace and death of Aias is more affecting to modern readers than the remainder of the drama. But we should bear in mind that the vindication of Aias after death, and his burial with undiminished honours, had an absorbing interest for the Athenian and Salaminian spectator.

\par  Philoctetes also is rejected by man and accepted by Destiny. The Argives in his case, as the Thebans in the case of Oedipus, are blind to the real intentions of the Gods.

\par  The Philoctetes, like the Oedipus at Colonos, was a work of Sophocles’ old age; and while it can hardly be said that the fire of tragic feeling is abated in either of these plays, dramatic effect is modified in both of them by the influence of the poet’s contemplative mood. The interest of the action in the Philoctetes is more inward [page xxiii] and psychological than in any other ancient drama. The change of mind in Neoptolemus, the stubborn fixity of will in Philoctetes, contrasted with the confiding tenderness of his nature, form the elements of a dramatic movement at once extremely simple and wonderfully sustained. No purer ideal of virtuous youth has been imagined than the son of Achilles, who in this play, though sorely tempted, sets faithfulness before ambition.

\par  6. In the Electra, which, though much earlier than the Philoctetes, is still a work of his mature genius, our poet appears at first sight to be in unequal competition with Aeschylus. If the Theban trilogy of the elder poet had remained entire, a similar impression might have been produced by the Oedipus Tyrannus. It is best to lay such comparisons aside, and to consider the work of Sophocles simply on its own merits. The subject, as he has chosen to treat it, is the heroic endurance of a woman who devotes her life to the vindication of intolerable wrongs done to her father, and the restoration of her young brother to his hereditary rights. Hers is the human agency which for this purpose works together with Apollo. But the divine intention is concealed from her. She suffers countless indignities from her father’s enemies, of whom her own mother is the chief. And, at length, all her hopes are shattered by the false tidings that Orestes is no more. Even then she does not relinquish her resolve. And the revulsion from her deep sorrow to extremity of joy, when she finds Orestes at her side and ready to perform the act of vengeance in his own person, is irresistably affecting, even when the play is only read.

\par  Sophocles is especially great in the delineation of ideal female characters. The heroic ardour of Antigone, and the no less heroic persistence and endurance of Electra, are both founded on the strength of their affection. And the affection in both cases is what some moderns too have called the purest of human feelings, the love of a sister for a brother. Another aspect of that world-old marvel, ‘the love of women,’ was presented in Aias’ captive bride, Tecmessa. This softer type also attains [page xxiv] to heroic grandeur in Dêanira, the wronged wife of Heracles, whose fatal error is caused by the innocent working of her wounded love.

\par  It is strange that so acute a critic as A.W. Schlegel should have doubted the Sophoclean authorship of the Trachiniae. If its religious and moral lessons are even less obtrusive than those of either Oedipus and of the Antigone, there is no play which more directly pierces to the very heart of humanity. And it is a superficial judgement which complains that here at all events our sympathies are distracted between the two chief persons, Dêanira and Heracles. To one passion of his, to one fond mistake of hers, the ruin of them both is due. Her love has made their fates inseparable. And the spectator, in sharing Hyllus’ grief, is afflicted for them both at once. We may well recognize in this treatment of the death of Heracles the hand of him who wrote—
 
\par  7. It is unnecessary to expatiate here on the merits of construction in which these seven plays are generally acknowledged to be unrivalled; the natural way in which the main situation is explained, the suddenness and inevitableness of the complications, the steadily sustained climax of emotion until the action culminates, the preservation of the fitting mood until the end, the subtlety and effectiveness of the minor contrasts of situation and character[4].

\par  But it may not be irrelevant to observe that the ‘acting qualities’ of Sophocles, as of Shakespeare, are [page xxv] best known to those who have seen him acted, whether in Greek, as by the students at Harvard[5] and Toronto[6], and more recently at Cambridge[7], or in English long ago by Miss Helen Faucit (since Lady Martin[8]), or still earlier and repeatedly in Germany, or in the French version of the Antigone by MM. Maurice and Vacquerie (1845) or of King Oedipus by M. Lacroix, in which the part of Œdipe Roi was finely sustained by M. Geoffroy in 1861, and by M. Mounet Sully in 1881[9]. With reference to the latter performance, which was continued throughout the autumn season, M. Francisque Sarcey wrote an article for the Temps newspaper of August 15, 1881, which is full of just and vivid appreciation. At the risk of seeming absurdly ‘modern’, I will quote from this article some of the more striking passages.

\par  ‘Ce troisième et ce quatrième actes, les plus émouvants qui se soient jamais produits sur aucune scène, se composent d’une suite de narrations, qui viennent l’une après l’autre frapper au cœur d’Œdipe, et qui ont leur contrecoup dans l’âme des spectateurs.

\par  These and other like remarks of one of the best-known critics of the Parisian stage show that the dramatic art of Sophocles is still a living power.

\par  I am well aware how feeble and inadequate the present attempted reproduction must appear to any reader who knows the Greek original. There is much to be said for the view of an eminent scholar who once declared that he would never think of translating a Greek poet. But the end of translating is not to satisfy fastidious scholars, but to make the classics partially accessible to those whose acquaintance with them would otherwise be still more defective. Part of this version of Sophocles was printed several years ago in an imperfect form. The present volume contains the seven extant plays entire. As the object has been to give the effect of each drama as a whole, rather than to dwell on particular ‘beauties’ (which only a poet can render), the fragments have not been included. But the reader should [page xxvii] bear in mind that the seven plays are less than a tithe of the work produced by the poet in his lifetime.

\par  It may very possibly be asked why verse has been employed at all. Why not have listened to Carlyle’s rough demand, ‘Tell us what they thought; none of your silly poetry’? The present translator can only reply that he began with prose, but soon found that, for tragic dialogue in English, blank verse appeared a more natural and effective vehicle than any prose style which he could hope to frame. And with the dialogue in verse, it was impossible to have the lyric parts in any sort of prose, simply because the reader would then have felt an intolerable incongruity. These parts have therefore been turned into such familiar lyric measures as seemed at once possible and not unsuitable. And where this method was found impracticable, as sometimes in the Commoi, blank metres have again been used,—with such liberties as seemed appropriate to the special purpose. The writer’s hope throughout has been, not indeed fully to transfuse the poetry of Sophocles into another tongue, but to make the poet’s dramatic intention to be understood and felt by English readers. One more such endeavour may possibly find acceptance at a time when many causes have combined to awaken a fresh interest at once in dramatic literature and in Hellenic studies.

\par  The reader who is hitherto unacquainted with the Greek drama, should be warned that the parts assigned to the ‘Chorus’ were often distributed among its several members, who spoke or chanted, singly or in groups, alternately or in succession. In some cases, but not in all, Ch. 1, Ch. 2, &c., have been prefixed, to indicate such an arrangement.

\par  Note. The town of Thebes is often personified as Thebè.

\par  [page 2] Polynices, son and heir to the unfortunate Oedipus, having been supplanted by his younger brother Eteocles, brought an army of Argives against his native city, Thebes. The army was defeated, and the two brothers slew each other in single combat. On this Creon, the brother-in-law of Oedipus, succeeding to the chief power, forbade the burial of Polynices. But Antigone, sister of the dead, placing the dues of affection and piety before her obligation to the magistrate, disobeyed the edict at the sacrifice of her life. Creon carried out his will, but lost his son Haemon and his wife Eurydice, and received their curses on his head. His other son, Megareus, had previously been devoted as a victim to the good of the state.

\par  ANTIGONE. ISMENE.

\par \textbf{ANTIGONE. Own sister of my blood, one life with me, Ismenè, have the tidings caught thine ear? Say, hath not Heaven decreed to execute On thee and me, while yet we are alive, All the evil Oedipus bequeathed? All horror, All pain, all outrage, falls on us! And now The General’s proclamation of to-day— Hast thou not heard?—Art thou so slow to hear When harm from foes threatens the souls we love?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISMENE. No word of those we love, Antigone, Painful or glad, hath reached me, since we two Were utterly deprived of our two brothers, Cut off with mutual stroke, both in one day. And since the Argive host this now-past night Is vanished, I know nought beside to make me Nearer to happiness or more in woe.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. I knew it well, and therefore led thee forth The palace gate, that thou alone mightst hear.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Speak on! Thy troubled look bodes some dark news.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Why, hath not Creon, in the burial-rite, Of our two brethren honoured one, and wrought On one foul wrong? Eteocles, they tell, With lawful consecration he lays out, And after covers him in earth, adorned With amplest honours in the world below. But Polynices, miserably slain, They say ’tis publicly proclaimed that none Must cover in a grave, nor mourn for him; But leave him tombless and unwept, a store Of sweet provision for the carrion fowl That eye him greedily. Such righteous law Good Creon hath pronounced for thy behoof— [page 4][32-65] Ay, and for mine! I am not left out!—And now He moves this way to promulgate his will To such as have not heard, nor lightly holds The thing he bids, but, whoso disobeys, The citizens shall stone him to the death. This is the matter, and thou wilt quickly show If thou art noble, or fallen below thy birth.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Unhappy one! But what can I herein Avail to do or undo?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Wilt thou share The danger and the labour? Make thy choice.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Of what wild enterprise? What canst thou mean?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Wilt thou join hand with mine to lift the dead?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. To bury him, when all have been forbidden? Is that thy thought?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. To bury my own brother And thine, even though thou wilt not do thy part. I will not be a traitress to my kin.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Fool-hardy girl! against the word of Creon?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. He hath no right to bar me from mine own.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Ah, sister, think but how our father fell, Hated of all and lost to fair renown, Through self-detected crimes—with his own hand, Self-wreaking, how he dashed out both his eyes}
\par   Then how the mother-wife, sad two-fold name! With twisted halter bruised her life away, Last, how in one dire moment our two brothers With internecine conflict at a blow Wrought out by fratricide their mutual doom. Now, left alone, O think how beyond all Most piteously we twain shall be destroyed, If in defiance of authority We traverse the commandment of the King! We needs must bear in mind we are but women, Never created to contend with men; Nay more, made victims of resistless power, To obey behests more harsh than this to-day. I, then, imploring those beneath to grant [page 5][66-99] Indulgence, seeing I am enforced in this, Will yield submission to the powers that rule, Small wisdom were it to overpass the bound.

\par \textbf{ANT. I will not urge you! no! nor if now you list To help me, will your help afford me joy. Be what you choose to be! This single hand Shall bury our lost brother. Glorious For me to take this labour and to die! Dear to him will my soul be as we rest In death, when I have dared this holy crime. My time for pleasing men will soon be over; Not so my duty toward the Dead! My home Yonder will have no end. You, if you will, May pour contempt on laws revered on High.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Not from irreverence. But I have no strength To strive against the citizens’ resolve.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Thou, make excuses! I will go my way To raise a burial-mound to my dear brother.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Oh, hapless maiden, how I fear for thee!}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Waste not your fears on me! Guide your own fortune.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Ah! yet divulge thine enterprise to none, But keep the secret close, and so will I.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. O Heavens! Nay, tell! I hate your silence worse; I had rather you proclaimed it to the world.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. You are ardent in a chilling enterprise.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. I know that I please those whom I would please.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Yes, if you thrive; but your desire is bootless.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Well, when I fail I shall be stopt, I trow!}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. One should not start upon a hopeless quest.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Speak in that vein if you would earn my hate And aye be hated of our lost one. Peace! Leave my unwisdom to endure this peril; Fate cannot rob me of a noble death.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Go, if you must—Not to be checked in folly, But sure unparalleled in faithful love![Exeunt}

\par \textbf{Beam of the mounting Sun!I 1 O brightest, fairest ray Seven-gated Thebè yet hath seen! Over the vale where Dircè’s fountains run At length thou appearedst, eye of golden Day, And with incitement of thy radiance keen Spurredst to faster flight The man of Argos hurrying from the fight. Armed at all points the warrior came, But driven before thy rising flame He rode, reverting his pale shield, Headlong from yonder battlefield.}
\par 

\par \textbf{In snow-white panoply, on eagle wing,[Half-Chorus He rose, dire ruin on our land to bring, Roused by the fierce debate Of Polynices’ hate, Shrilling sharp menace from his breast, Sheathed all in steel from crown to heel, With many a plumèd crest.}
\par 

\par \textbf{Then stooped above the domes,I 2 With lust of carnage fired, And opening teeth of serried spears Yawned wide around the gates that guard our homes; But went, or e’er his hungry jaws had tired On Theban flesh,—or e’er the Fire-god fierce Seizing our sacred town Besmirched and rent her battlemented crown. Such noise of battle as he fled About his back the War-god spread; So writhed to hard-fought victory The serpent struggling to be free.}

\par \textbf{Swung rudely to the hard repellent earthII 1 Amidst his furious mirth He fell, who then with flaring brand Held in his fiery hand Came breathing madness at the gate In eager blasts of hate.

\par  LEADER OF CHORUS.

\par \textbf{But look! where Creon in his new-made power, Moved by the fortune of the recent hour, Comes with fresh counsel. What intelligence Intends he for our private conference, That he hath sent his herald to us all, Gathering the elders with a general call?}
\par 

\par  Enter CREON.

\par \textbf{CREON. My friends, the noble vessel of our State, After sore shaking her, the Gods have sped On a smooth course once more. I have called you hither, By special messengers selecting you From all the city, first, because I knew you Aye loyal to the throne of Laïus; Then, both while Oedipus gave prosperous days, And since his fall, I still beheld you firm In sound allegiance to the royal issue. Now since the pair have perished in an hour, Twinned in misfortune, by a mutual stroke Staining our land with fratricidal blood, All rule and potency of sovereign sway, In virtue of next kin to the deceased, Devolves on me. But hard it is to learn The mind of any mortal or the heart, Till he be tried in chief authority. Power shows the man. For he who when supreme Withholds his hand or voice from the best cause, Being thwarted by some fear, that man to me Appears, and ever hath appeared, most vile. He too hath no high place in mine esteem, Who sets his friend before his fatherland. Let Zeus whose eye sees all eternally Be here my witness. I will ne’er keep silence When danger lours upon my citizens Who looked for safety, nor make him my friend Who doth not love my country. For I know Our country carries us, and whilst her helm Is held aright we gain good friends and true. [page 9][191-225] Following such courses ’tis my steadfast will To foster Thebè’s greatness, and therewith In brotherly accord is my decree Touching the sons of Oedipus. The man— Eteocles I mean—who died for Thebes Fighting with eminent prowess on her side, Shall be entombed with every sacred rite That follows to the grave the lordliest dead. But for his brother, who, a banished man, Returned to devastate and burn with fire The land of his nativity, the shrines Of his ancestral gods, to feed him fat With Theban carnage, and make captive all That should escape the sword—for Polynices, This law hath been proclaimed concerning him}
\par   He shall have no lament, no funeral, But he unburied, for the carrion fowl And dogs to eat his corse, a sight of shame. Such are the motions of this mind and will. Never from me shall villains reap renown Before the just. But whoso loves the State, I will exalt him both in life and death.

\par \textbf{CH. Son of Menoeceus, we have heard thy mind Toward him who loves, and him who hates our city. And sure, ’tis thine to enforce what law thou wilt Both on the dead and all of us who live.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Then be ye watchful to maintain my word.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Young strength for such a burden were more meet.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Already there be watchers of the dead.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. What charge then wouldst thou further lay on us?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Not to give place to those that disobey.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Who is so fond, to be in love with death?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Such, truly, is the meed. But hope of gain Full oft ere now hath been the ruin of men.}
\par 

\par \textbf{WATCHMAN (entering). My lord, I am out of breath, but not with speed. I will not say my foot was fleet. My thoughts Cried halt unto me ever as I came [page 10][226-257] And wheeled me to return. My mind discoursed Most volubly within my breast, and said— Fond wretch! why go where thou wilt find thy bane? Unhappy wight! say, wilt thou bide aloof? Then if the king shall hear this from another, How shalt thou ’scape for ’t? Winding thus about I hasted, but I could not speed, and so Made a long journey of a little way. At last ‘yes’ carried it, that I should come To thee; and tell thee I must needs; and shall, Though it be nothing that I have to tell. For I came hither, holding fast by this— Nought that is not my fate can happen to me.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Speak forth thy cause of fear. What is the matter?}
\par 

\par \textbf{WATCH. First of mine own part in the business. For I did it not, nor saw the man who did, And ’twere not right that I should come to harm.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. You fence your ground, and keep well out of danger; I see you have some strange thing to declare.}
\par 

\par \textbf{WATCH. A man will shrink who carries words of fear.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CB. Let us have done with you. Tell your tale, and go.}
\par 

\par \textbf{WATCH. Well, here it is. The corse hath burial From some one who is stolen away and gone, But first hath strown dry dust upon the skin, And added what religious rites require.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Ha! What man hath been so daring in revolt?}
\par 

\par \textbf{WATCH. I cannot tell. There was no mark to show— No dint of spade, or mattock-loosened sod,— Only the hard bare ground, untilled and trackless. Whoe’er he was, the doer left no trace. And, when the scout of our first daylight watch Showed us the thing, we marvelled in dismay. The Prince was out of sight; not in a grave, But a thin dust was o’er him, as if thrown By one who shunned the dead man’s curse. No sign Appeared of any hound or beast o’ the field [page 11][258-295] Having come near, or pulled at the dead body. Then rose high words among us sentinels With bickering noise accusing each his mate, And it seemed like to come to blows, with none To hinder. For the hand that thus had wrought Was any of ours, and none; the guilty man Escaped all knowledge. And we were prepared To lift hot iron with our bare palms; to walk Through fire, and swear by all the Gods at once That we were guiltless, ay, and ignorant Of who had plotted or performed this thing. When further search seemed bootless, at the last One spake, whose words bowed all our heads to the earth With fear. We knew not what to answer him, Nor how to do it and prosper. He advised So grave a matter must not be concealed, But instantly reported to the King. Well, this prevailed, and the lot fell on me, Unlucky man! to be the ministrant Of this fair service. So I am present here, Against my will and yours, I am sure of that. None love the bringer of unwelcome news.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. My lord, a thought keeps whispering in my breast, Some Power divine hath interposed in this.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Cease, ere thou quite enrage me, and appear Foolish as thou art old. Talk not to me Of Gods who have taken thought for this dead man! Say, was it for his benefits to them They hid his corse, and honoured him so highly, Who came to set on fire their pillared shrines, With all the riches of their offerings, And to make nothing of their land and laws? Or, hast thou seen them honouring villany? That cannot be. Long time the cause of this Hath come to me in secret murmurings From malcontents of Thebes, who under yoke Turned restive, and would not accept my sway. Well know I, these have bribed the watchmen here To do this for some fee. For nought hath grown [page 12][296-331] Current among mankind so mischievous As money. This brings cities to their fall}
\par   This drives men homeless, and moves honest minds To base contrivings. This hath taught mankind The use of wickedness, and how to give An impious turn to every kind of act. But whosoe’er hath done this for reward Hath found his way at length to punishment. If Zeus have still my worship, be assured Of that which here on oath I say to thee— Unless ye find the man who made this grave And bring him bodily before mine eye, Death shall not be enough, till ye have hung Alive for an example of your guilt, That henceforth in your rapine ye may know Whence gain is to be gotten, and may learn Pelf from all quarters is not to be loved. For in base getting, ’tis a common proof, More find disaster than deliverance.

\par \textbf{WATCH. Am I to speak? or must I turn and go?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. What? know you not your speech offends even now?}
\par 

\par \textbf{WATCH. Doth the mind smart withal, or only the ear?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Art thou to probe the seat of mine annoy?}
\par 

\par \textbf{WATCH. If I offend, ’tis in your ear alone, The malefactor wounds ye to the soul.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Out on thee! thou art nothing but a tongue.}
\par 

\par \textbf{WATCH. Then was I ne’er the doer of this deed.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Yea, verily}
\par   self-hired to crime for gold.

\par \textbf{WATCH. Pity so clear a mind should clearly err!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Gloze now on clearness! But unless ye bring The burier, without glozing ye shall tell, Craven advantage clearly worketh bane.}
\par 

\par \textbf{WATCH. By all means let the man be found; one thing I know right well}
\par  —caught or not caught, howe’er Fate rules his fortune, me you ne’er will see Standing in presence here. Even now I owe Deep thanks to Heaven for mine escape, so far Beyond my hope and highest expectancy. [Exeunt severally

\par \textbf{What portent from the Gods is here? My mind is mazed with doubt and fear. How can I gainsay what I see? I know the girl Antigone, O hapless child of hapless sire! Didst thou, then, recklessly aspire To brave kings’ laws, and now art brought In madness of transgression caught?}
\par 

\par  Enter Watchman, bringing in ANTIGONE

\par \textbf{WATCH. Here is the doer of the deed—this maid We found her burying him. Where is the King?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Look, he comes forth again to meet thy call.}
\par 

\par  Enter CREON.

\par \textbf{CR. What call so nearly times with mine approach?}
\par 

\par \textbf{WATCH. My lord, no mortal should deny on oath, Judgement is still belied by after thought When quailing ’neath the tempest of your threats, Methought no force would drive me to this place But joy unlook’d for and surpassing hope Is out of bound the best of all delight, And so I am here again,—though I had sworn I ne’er would come,—and in my charge this maid, Caught in the act of caring for the dead Here was no lot throwing, this hap was mine [page 15][397-430] Without dispute. And now, my sovereign lord, According to thy pleasure, thine own self Examine and convict her. For my part I have good right to be away and free From the bad business I am come upon.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. This maiden! How came she in thy charge? Where didst thou find her?}
\par 

\par \textbf{WATCH. Burying the prince. One word hath told thee all.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Hast thou thy wits, and knowest thou what thou sayest?}
\par 

\par \textbf{WATCH. I saw her burying him whom you forbade To bury. Is that, now, clearly spoken, or no?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. And how was she detected, caught, and taken?}
\par 

\par \textbf{WATCH. It fell in this wise. We were come to the spot, Bearing the dreadful burden of thy threats; And first with care we swept the dust away From round the corse, and laid the dank limbs bare}
\par   Then sate below the hill-top, out o’ the wind, Where no bad odour from the dead might strike us, Stirring each other on with interchange Of loud revilings on the negligent In ’tendance on this duty. So we stayed Till in mid heaven the sun’s resplendent orb Stood high, and the heat strengthened. Suddenly, The Storm-god raised a whirlwind from the ground, Vexing heaven’s concave, and filled all the plain, Rending the locks of all the orchard groves, Till the great sky was choked withal. We closed Our lips and eyes, and bore the God-sent evil. When after a long while this ceased, the maid Was seen, and wailed in high and bitter key, Like some despairing bird that hath espied Her nest all desolate, the nestlings gone. So, when she saw the body bare, she mourned Loudly, and cursed the authors of this deed. Then nimbly with her hands she brought dry dust, And holding high a shapely brazen cruse, [page 16][431-467] Poured three libations, honouring the dead. We, when we saw, ran in, and straightway seized Our quarry, nought dismayed, and charged her with The former crime and this. And she denied Nothing;—to my delight, and to my grief. One’s self to escape disaster is great joy; Yet to have drawn a friend into distress Is painful. But mine own security To me is of more value than aught else.

\par \textbf{CR. Thou, with thine eyes down-fastened to the earth! Dost thou confess to have done this, or deny it?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. I deny nothing. I avow the deed.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. (to Watchman). Thou may’st betake thyself whither thou wilt, Acquitted of the grievous charge, and free. (to ANTIGONE) And thou,—no prating talk, but briefly tell, Knew’st thou our edict that forbade this thing?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. I could not fail to know. You made it plain.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. How durst thou then transgress the published law?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. I heard it not from Heaven, nor came it forth From Justice, where she reigns with Gods below. They too have published to mankind a law. Nor thought I thy commandment of such might That one who is mortal thus could overbear The infallible, unwritten laws of Heaven. Not now or yesterday they have their being, But everlastingly, and none can tell The hour that saw their birth. I would not, I, For any terror of a man’s resolve, Incur the God-inflicted penalty Of doing them wrong. That death would come, I knew Without thine edict;—if before the time, I count it gain. Who does not gain by death, That lives, as I do, amid boundless woe? Slight is the sorrow of such doom to me. But had I suffered my own mother’s child, Fallen in blood, to be without a grave, [page 17][468-503] That were indeed a sorrow. This is none. And if thou deem’st me foolish for my deed, I am foolish in the judgement of a fool.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Fierce shows the maiden’s vein from her fierce sire; Calamity doth not subdue her will.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Ay, but the stubborn spirit first doth fall. Oft ye shall see the strongest bar of steel, That fire hath hardened to extremity, Shattered to pieces. A small bit controls The fiery steed. Pride may not be endured In one whose life is subject to command. This maiden hath been conversant with crime Since first she trampled on the public law; And now she adds to crime this insolence, To laugh at her offence, and glory in it. Truly, if she that hath usurped this power Shall rest unpunished, she then is a man, And I am none. Be she my sister’s child, Or of yet nearer blood to me than all That take protection from my hearth, the pair Shall not escape the worst of deaths. For know, I count the younger of the twain no less Copartner in this plotted funeral}
\par   And now I bid you call her. Late I saw her Within the house, beyond herself, and frantic. —Full oft when one is darkly scheming wrong, The disturbed spirit hath betrayed itself Before the act it hides.—But not less hateful Seems it to me, when one that hath been caught In wickedness would give it a brave show.

\par \textbf{ANT. Wouldst thou aught more of me than merely death?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. No more. ’Tis all I claim. Death closes all.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Why then delay? No talk of thine can charm me, Forbid it Heaven! And my discourse no less Must evermore sound noisome to thine ear. Yet where could I have found a fairer fame Than giving burial to my own true brother? [page 18][504-536] All here would tell thee they approve my deed, Were they not tongue-tied to authority. But kingship hath much profit; this in chief, That it may do and say whate’er it will.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. No Theban sees the matter with thine eye.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. They see, but curb their voices to thy sway}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. And art thou not ashamed, acting alone?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. A sister’s piety hath no touch of shame.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Was not Eteocles thy brother too?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. My own true brother from both parents’ blood.}

\par \textbf{ISM. What joy have I in life when thou art gone?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Ask Creon there. He hath your care and duty.}

\par  CHORUS.

\par \textbf{Blest is the life that never tasted woe.I 1 When once the blow Hath fallen upon a house with Heaven-sent doom, Trouble descends in ever-widening gloom Through all the number of the tribe to flow; As when the briny surge That Thrace-born tempests urge (The big wave ever gathering more and more) Runs o’er the darkness of the deep, And with far-searching sweep Uprolls the storm-heap’d tangle on the shore, While cliff to beaten cliff resounds with sullen roar.}
\par 

\par \textbf{The stock of Cadmus from old time, I know,I 2 Hath woe on woe, Age following age, the living on the dead, Fresh sorrow falling on each new-ris’n head, None freed by God from ruthless overthrow. E’en now a smiling light Was spreading to our sight O’er one last fibre of a blasted tree,— When, lo! the dust of cruel death, Tribute of Gods beneath, And wildering thoughts, and fate-born ecstasy, Quench the brief gleam in dark Nonentity.}
\par 

\par \textbf{What froward will of man, O Zeus! can check thy might?II 1 Not all-enfeebling sleep, nor tireless months divine, Can touch thee, who through ageless time Rulest mightily Olympus’ dazzling height. [page 21][611-647] This was in the beginning, and shall be Now and eternally, Not here or there, but everywhere, A law of misery that shall not spare.}
\par 

\par \textbf{For Hope, that wandereth wide, comforting many a head,II 2 Entangleth many more with glamour of desire}
\par   Unknowing they have trode the fire. Wise was the famous word of one who said, ‘Evil oft seemeth goodness to the mind An angry God doth blind.’ Few are the days that such as he May live untroubled of calamity.

\par  LEADER OF CHORUS.

\par \textbf{Lo, Haemon, thy last offspring, now is come, Lamenting haply for the maiden’s doom, Say, is he mourning o’er her young life lost, Fiercely indignant for his bridal crossed?}
\par 

\par  Enter HAEMON.

\par \textbf{CR. We shall know soon, better than seers could teach us. Can it be so, my son, that thou art brought By mad distemperature against thy sire, On hearing of the irrevocable doom Passed on thy promised bride? Or is thy love Thy father’s, be his actions what they may?}
\par 

\par \textbf{HAEMON. I am thine, father, and will follow still Thy good directions; nor would I prefer The fairest bride to thy wise government.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. That, O my son! should be thy constant mind, In all to bend thee to thy father’s will. Therefore men pray to have around their hearths Obedient offspring, to requite their foes With harm, and honour whom their father loves; But he whose issue proves unprofitable, Begets what else but sorrow to himself And store of laughter to his enemies? [page 22][648-686] Make not, my son, a shipwreck of thy wit For a woman. Thine own heart may teach thee this;— There’s but cold comfort in a wicked wife Yoked to the home inseparably. What wound Can be more deadly than a harmful friend? Then spurn her like an enemy, and send her To wed some shadow in the world below! For since of all the city I have found Her only recusant, caught in the act, I will not break my word before the State. I will take her life. At this let her invoke The god of kindred blood! For if at home I foster rebels, how much more abroad? Whoso is just in ruling his own house, Lives rightly in the commonwealth no less}
\par   But he that wantonly defies the law, Or thinks to dictate to authority, Shall have no praise from me. What power soe’er The city hath ordained, must be obeyed In little things and great things, right or wrong. The man who so obeys, I have good hope Will govern and be governed as he ought, And in the storm of battle at my side Will stand a faithful and a trusty comrade. But what more fatal than the lapse of rule? This ruins cities, this lays houses waste, This joins with the assault of war to break Full numbered armies into hopeless rout; And in the unbroken host ’tis nought but rule That keeps those many bodies from defeat, I must be zealous to defend the law, And not go down before a woman’s will. Else, if I fall, ’twere best a man should strike me; Lest one should say, ‘a woman worsted him.’

\par \textbf{CH. Unless our sense is weakened by long time, Thou speakest not unwisely.}
\par 

\par \textbf{HAEM. O my sire, Sound wisdom is a God implanted seed, Of all possessions highest in regard. I cannot, and I would not learn to say [page 23][687-723] That thou art wrong in this; though in another, It may be such a word were not unmeet. But as thy son, ’tis surely mine to scan Men’s deeds, and words, and muttered thoughts toward thee. Fear of thy frown restrains the citizen In talk that would fall harshly on thine ear. I under shadow may o’erhear, how all Thy people mourn this maiden, and complain That of all women least deservedly She perishes for a most glorious deed. ‘Who, when her own true brother on the earth Lay weltering after combat in his gore, Left him not graveless, for the carrion few And raw devouring field dogs to consume— Hath she not merited a golden praise?’ Such the dark rumour spreading silently. Now, in my valuing, with thy prosperous life, My father, no possession can compare. Where can be found a richer ornament For children, than their father’s high renown? Or where for fathers, than their children’s fame? Nurse not one changeless humour in thy breast, That nothing can be right but as thou sayest. Whoe’er presumes that he alone hath sense, Or peerless eloquence, or reach of soul, Unwrap him, and you’ll find but emptiness. ’Tis no disgrace even to the wise to learn And lend an ear to reason. You may see The plant that yields where torrent waters flow Saves every little twig, when the stout tree Is torn away and dies. The mariner Who will not ever slack the sheet that sways The vessel, but still tightens, oversets, And so, keel upward, ends his voyaging. Relent, I pray thee, and give place to change. If any judgement hath informed my youth, I grant it noblest to be always wise, But,—for omniscience is denied to man— Tis good to hearken to admonishment.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 24][724-757] CH. My lord, ’twere wise, if thou wouldst learn of him In reason; and thou, Haemon, from thy sire! Truth lies between you.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Shall our age, forsooth, Be taught discretion by a peevish boy?}
\par 

\par \textbf{HAEM. Only in what is right. Respects of time Must be outbalanced by the actual need.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. To cringe to rebels cannot be a need.}

\par \textbf{HAEM. I do not claim observance for the vile.}
\par

\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Only for her who acted. Thou art right.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. And what hast thou determined for her death?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Where human footstep shuns the desert ground, I’ll hide her living in a cave like vault, With so much provender as may prevent Pollution from o’ertaking the whole city And there, perchance, she may obtain of Death, Her only deity, to spare her soul, Or else in that last moment she will learn ’Tis labour lost to worship powers unseen.[Exit CREON}

\par  LEADER OF CHORUS.

\par \textbf{Ah! now myself am carried past the bound Of law, nor can I check the rising tear, When I behold Antigone even here Touching the quiet bourne where all must rest.}
\par 

\par  Enter ANTIGONE guarded.

\par \textbf{ANT. Ye see me on my way,I 1 O burghers of my father’s land! With one last look on Helios’ ray, Led my last path toward the silent strand. Alive to the wide house of rest I go; No dawn for me may shine, No marriage-blessing e’er be mine, No hymeneal with my praises flow! The Lord of Acheron’s unlovely shore Shall be mine only husband evermore.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Yea, but with glory and fame,— Not by award of the sword, Not with blighting disease, But by a law of thine own,— Thou, of mortals alone, Goest alive to the deep Tranquil home of the dead.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Erewhile I heard men say,I 2 How, in far Phrygia, Thebè’s friend, Tantalus’ child, had dreariest end On heights of Sipylus consumed away}
\par   O’er whom the rock like clinging ivy grows, And while with moistening dew Her cheek runs down, the eternal snows Weigh o’er her, and the tearful stream renew That from sad brows her stone-cold breast doth steep. Like unto her the God lulls me to sleep.

\par \textbf{[page 27][834-873] CH. But she was a goddess born, We but of mortal line; And sure to rival the fate Of a daughter of sires Divine Were no light glory in death.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. O mockery of my woe!II 1 I pray you by our fathers’ holy Fear, Why must I hear Your insults, while in life on earth I stand, O ye that flow In wealth, rich burghers of my bounteous land? O fount of Dircè, and thou spacious grove, Where Thebè’s chariots move! Ye are my witness, though none else be nigh, By what enormity of lawless doom, Without one friendly sigh, I go to the strong mound of yon strange tomb,— All hapless, having neither part nor room With those who live or those who die!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Thy boldness mounted high, And thou, my child, ’gainst the great pedestal Of Justice with unmeasured force didst fall. Thy father’s lot still presseth hard on thee.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. That pains me more than all.II 2 Ah! thou hast touched my father’s misery Still mourned anew, With all the world-famed sorrows on us rolled Since Cadmus old. O cursèd marriage that my mother knew! O wretched fortune of my sire, who lay Where first he saw the day! Such were the authors of my burdened life; To whom, with curses dowered, never a wife, I go to dwell beneath. O brother mine, thy princely marriage-tie Hath been thy downfall, and in this thy death Thou hast destroyed me ere I die.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. ’Twas pious, we confess, Thy fervent deed. But he, who power would show, [page 28][874-912] Must let no soul of all he rules transgress. A self-willed passion was thine overthrow.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Friendless, uncomforted of bridal lay,III Unmourned, they lead me on my destined way. Woe for my life forlorn! I may not see The sacred round of yon great light Rising again to greet me from the night; No friend bemoans my fate, no tear hath fallen for me!}
\par 

\par  Enter CREON.

\par \textbf{CR. If criminals were suffered to complain In dirges before death, they ne’er would end. Away with her at once, and closing her, As I commanded, in the vaulty tomb, Leave her all desolate, whether to die, Or to live on in that sepulchral cell. We are guiltless in the matter of this maid; Only she shall not share the light of day.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. O grave! my bridal chamber, prison-house Eterne, deep-hollowed, whither I am led To find mine own,—of whom Persephonè Hath now a mighty number housed in death}
\par  — I last of all, and far most miserably, Am going, ere my days have reached their term! Yet lives the hope that, when I go, most surely Dear will my coming be, father, to thee, And dear to thee, my mother, and to thee, Brother! since with these very hands I decked And bathed you after death, and ministered The last libations. And I reap this doom For tending, Polynices, on thy corse. Indeed I honoured thee, the wise will say. For neither, had I children, nor if one I had married were laid bleeding on the earth, Would I have braved the city’s will, or taken This burden on me. Wherefore? I will tell. A husband lost might be replaced; a son, If son were lost to me, might yet be born; But, with both parents hidden in the tomb, No brother may arise to comfort me. [page 29][913-952] Therefore above all else I honoured thee, And therefore Creon thought me criminal, And bold in wickedness, O brother mine! And now by servile hands, for all to see, He hastens me away, unhusbanded, Before my nuptial, having never known Or married joy or tender motherhood. But desolate and friendless I go down Alive, O horror! to the vaults of the dead. For what transgression of Heaven’s ordinance? Alas! how can I look to Heaven? on whom Call to befriend me? seeing that I have earned, By piety, the meed of impious?— Oh! if this act be what the Gods approve, In death I may repent me of my deed; But if they sin who judge me, be their doom No heavier than they wrongly wreak on me!

\par \textbf{CH. With unchanged fury beats the storm of soul That shakes this maiden.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Then for that, be sure Her warders shall lament their tardiness.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Alas! I hear Death’s footfall in that sound.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. I may not reassure thee.—’Tis most true.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. O land of Thebè, city of my sires, Ye too, ancestral Gods! I go—I go! Even now they lead me to mine end. Behold! Founders of Thebes, the only scion left Of Cadmus’ issue, how unworthily, By what mean instruments I am oppressed, For reverencing the dues of piety.[Exit guarded}
\par 

\par  CHORUS.

\par \textbf{Even Danaë’s beauty left the lightsome day.I 1 Closed in her strong and brass-bound tower she lay In tomb-like deep confine. Yet she was gendered, O my child! From sires of noblest line, And treasured for the Highest the golden rain. Fated misfortune hath a power so fell}

\par 

\par \textbf{And near twin rocks that guard the Colchian sea,II 1 Bosporian cliffs ’fore Salmydessus rise, Where neighbouring Ares from his shrine beheld Phineus’ two sons by female fury quelled.

\par 

\par \textbf{But chiefly for her piteous lot they pined,II 2 Who was the source of their rejected birth. She touched the lineage of Erechtheus old; Whence in far caves her life did erst unfold, Cradled ’mid storms, daughter of Northern wind, Steed-swift o’er all steep places of the earth. Yet even on her, though reared of heavenly kind, The long-enduring Fates at last took hold.}

\par  Enter TIRESIAS, led by a boy.

\par \textbf{TIRESIAS. We are come, my lords of Thebes, joint wayfarers, One having eyes for both. The blind must still Thus move in frail dependence on a guide.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. And what hath brought thee, old Tirésias, now?}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. I will instruct thee, if thou wilt hear my voice.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. I have not heretofore rejected thee.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. Therefore thy pilotage hath saved this city.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 31][995-1032] CR. Grateful experience owns the benefit.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. Take heed. Again thou art on an edge of peril.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. What is it? How I shudder at thy word!}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. The tokens of mine art shall make thee know. As I was sitting on that ancient seat Of divination, where I might command Sure cognisance of every bird of the air, I heard strange clamouring of fowl, that screeched In furious dissonance; and, I could tell, Talons were bloodily engaged—the whirr Of wings told a clear tale. At once, in fear, I tried burnt sacrifice at the high altar}
\par   Where from the offering the fire god refused To gleam; but a dank humour from the bones Dripped on the embers with a sputtering fume. The gall was spirited high in air, the thighs Lay wasting, bared of their enclosing fat. Such failing tokens of blurred augury This youth reported, who is guide to me, As I to others. And this evil state Is come upon the city from thy will:  Because our altars—yea, our sacred hearths— Are everywhere infected from the mouths Of dogs or beak of vulture that hath fed On Oedipus’ unhappy slaughtered son. And then at sacrifice the Gods refuse Our prayers and savour of the thigh-bone fat— And of ill presage is the thickening cry Of bird that battens upon human gore Now, then, my son, take thought. A man may err; But he is not insensate or foredoomed To ruin, who, when he hath lapsed to evil, Stands not inflexible, but heals the harm. The obstinate man still earns the name of fool. Urge not contention with the dead, nor stab The fallen. What valour is ’t to slay the slain? I have thought well of this, and say it with care; And careful counsel, that brings gain withal, Is precious to the understanding soul.

\par \textbf{[page 32][1033-1071] CR. I am your mark, and ye with one consent All shoot your shafts at me. Nought left untried, Not even the craft of prophets, by whose crew I am bought and merchandised long since. Go on! Traffic, get gain, electrum from the mine Of Lydia, and the gold of Ind! Yet know, Grey-beard! ye ne’er shall hide him in a tomb. No, not if heaven’s own eagle chose to snatch And bear him to the throne supreme for food, Even that pollution should not daunt my heart To yield permission for his funeral. For well know I defilement ne’er can rise From man to God. But, old Tirésias, hear! Even wisest spirits have a shameful fall That fairly speak base words for love of gain.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. Ah! where is wisdom? who considereth?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Wherefore? what means this universal doubt?}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. How far the best of riches is good counsel!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. As far as folly is the mightiest bane.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. Yet thou art sick of that same pestilence.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. I would not give the prophet blow for blow.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. What blow is harder than to call me false?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Desire of money is the prophet’s plague.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. And ill-sought lucre is the curse of kings.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Know’st thou ’tis of thy sovereign thou speak’st this?}

\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Say on, so thou speak sooth, and not for gain.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. You think me likely to seek gain from you?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. You shall not make your merchandise on me!}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. Not many courses of the racing sun Shalt thou fulfil, ere of thine own true blood Thou shalt have given a corpse in recompense For one on earth whom thou hast cast beneath, Entombing shamefully a living soul, And one whom thou hast kept above the ground And disappointed of all obsequies, [page 33][1070-1106] Unsanctified and godlessly forlorn. Such violence the powers beneath will bear Not even from the Olympian gods. For thee The avengers wait. Hidden but near at hand, Lagging but sure, the Furies of the grave Are watching for thee to thy ruinous harm, With thine own evil to entangle thee. Look well to it now whether I speak for gold! A little while, and thine own palace-halls Shall flash the truth upon thee with loud noise Of men and women, shrieking o’er the dead. And all the cities whose unburied sons, Mangled and torn, have found a sepulchre In dogs or jackals or some ravenous bird That stains their incense with polluted breath, Are forming leagues in troublous enmity. Such shafts, since thou hast stung me to the quick, I like an archer at thee in my wrath Have loosed unerringly—carrying their pang, Inevitable, to thy very heart. Now, sirrah! lead me home, that his hot mood Be spent on younger objects, till he learn To keep a safer mind and calmer tongue.[Exit}

\par \textbf{EURYDICE. Ye men of Thebes, the tidings met mine ear As I was coming forth to visit Pallas With prayerful salutation. I was loosening The bar of the closed gate, when the sharp sound Of mine own sorrow smote against my heart, And I fell back astonied on my maids And fainted. But the tale? tell me once more; I am no novice in adversity.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Dear lady, I will tell thee what I saw, And hide no grain of truth}
\par   why should I soothe Thy spirit with soft tales, when the harsh fact Must prove me a liar? Truth is always best. I duly led the footsteps of thy lord To the highest point of the plain, where still was lying, Forlorn and mangled by the dogs, the corse Of Polynices. We besought Persephonè And Pluto gently to restrain their wrath, And wash’d him pure and clean, and then we burned The poor remains with brushwood freshly pulled, And heaped a lofty mound of his own earth Above him. Then we turned us to the vault, The maiden’s stony bride-chamber of death. And from afar, round the unhallowed cell, One heard a voice of wailing loud and long, And went and told his lord:  who coming near Was haunted by the dim and bitter cry, And suddenly exclaiming on his fate Said lamentably, ‘My prophetic heart Divined aright. I am going, of all ways That e’er I went, the unhappiest to-day. My son’s voice smites me. Go, my men, approach With speed, and, where the stones are torn away, Press through the passage to that door of death, Look hard, and tell me, if I hear aright [page 37][1218-1252] The voice of Haemon, or the gods deceive me.’ Thus urged by our despairing lord, we made Th’ espial. And in the farthest nook of the vault We saw the maiden hanging by the neck With noose of finest tissue firmly tied, And clinging to her on his knees the boy, Lamenting o’er his ruined nuptial-rite, Consummated in death, his father’s crime And his lost love. And when the father saw him, With loud and dreadful clamour bursting in He went to him and called him piteously:  ‘What deed is this, unhappy youth? What thought O’ermaster’d thee? Where did the force of woe O’erturn thy reason? O come forth, my son, I beg thee!’ But with savage eyes the youth Glared scowling at him, and without a word Plucked forth his two-edged blade. The father then Fled and escaped:  but the unhappy boy, Wroth with himself, even where he stood, leant heavily Upon his sword and plunged it in his side.— And while the sense remained, his slackening arm Enfolded still the maiden, and his breath, Gaspingly drawn and panted forth with pain, Cast ruddy drops upon her pallid face; Then lay in death upon the dead, at last Joined to his bride in Hades’ dismal hall: — A monument unto mankind, that rashness Is the worst evil of this mortal state. [Exit EURYDICE

\par  [page 42] ‘A wounded spirit who can bear?’

\par  After the death of Achilles, the armour made for him by Hephaestus was to be given to the worthiest of the surviving Greeks. Although Aias was the most valiant, the judges made the award to Odysseus, because he was the wisest.

\par  Aias in his rage attempts to kill the generals; but Athena sends madness upon him, and he makes a raid upon the flocks and herds of the army, imagining the bulls and rams to be the Argive chiefs. On awakening from his delusion, he finds that he has fallen irrecoverably from honour and from the favour of the Greeks. He also imagines that the anger of Athena is unappeasable. Under this impression he eludes the loving eyes of his captive-bride Tecmessa, and of his Salaminian comrades, and falls on his sword. (‘The soul and body rive not more in parting Than greatness going off.’)

\par  But it is revealed through the prophet Calchas, that the wrath of Athena will last only for a day; and on the return of Teucer, Aias receives an honoured funeral, the tyrannical reclamations of the two sons of Atreus being overcome by the firm fidelity of Teucer and the magnanimity of Odysseus, who has been inspired for this purpose by Athena.

Right well thy sense Hath led thee forth, like some keen hound of Sparta! The man is even but now come home, his head And slaughterous hands reeking with ardent toil. Thou, then, no longer strain thy gaze within Yon gateway, but declare what eager chase Thou followest, that a god may give thee light.}

\par \textbf{ODYSSEUS. Athena, ’tis thy voice! Dearest in heaven, How well discerned and welcome to my soul From that dim distance doth thine utterance fly In tones as of Tyrrhenian trumpet clang! Rightly hast thou divined mine errand here, Beating this ground for Aias of the shield, The lion-quarry whom I track to day. For he hath wrought on us to night a deed Past thought—if he be doer of this thing; We drift in ignorant doubt, unsatisfied— And I unbidden have bound me to this toil.}
\par 

\par \textbf{Brief time hath flown since suddenly we knew That all our gathered spoil was reaved and slaughtered, Flocks, herds, and herdmen, by some human hand, All tongues, then, lay this deed at Aias’ door.

\par 

\par \textbf{ATH. I turned him backward from his baleful joy, And overswayed him with blind phantasies, To swerve against the flocks and well-watched herd Not yet divided from the public booty. There plunging in he hewed the horned throng, And with him Havoc ranged}

Come, thou shalt see this madness in clear day, [page 45][67-100] And tell to the Argives all I show thee here Only stand firm and shrink not, I will turn His eyes askance, not to distinguish thee, Fear nought—Ho! thou that bindest to thy will The limbs of those thy captives, come thou forth!

\par \textbf{ATH. Then, warned by what thou seest, be thou not rash To vaunt high words toward Heaven, nor swell thy port Too proudly, if in puissance of thy hand Thou passest others, or in mines of wealth.

Forth then he fared Alone—What horror passed upon the plain This night, I know not. But he drags within, Tied in a throng, bulls, shepherd dogs, and spoil Of cattle and sheep. Anon he butchers them, Felling or piercing, hacking or tearing wide, Ribs from breast, limb from limb. Others in rage He seized and bound and tortured, brutes for men. Last, out he rushed before the doors, and there Whirled forth wild language to some shadowy form, Flouting the generals and Laërtes’ son [page 52][303-341] With torrent laughter and loud triumphing What in his raid he had wreaked to their despite. Then diving back within—the fitful storm Slowly assuaging left his spirit clear. And when his eye had lightened through the room Cumbered with ruin, smiting on his brow He roared; and, tumbling down amid the wreck Of woolly carnage he himself had made, Sate with clenched hand tight twisted in his hair. Long stayed he so in silence. Then flashed forth Those frightful words of threatening vehemence, That bade me show him all the night’s mishap, And whither he was fallen I, dear my friends, Prevailed on through my fear, told all I knew. And all at once he raised a bitter cry, Which heretofore I ne’er had heard, for still He made us think such doleful utterance Betokened the dull craven spirit, and still Dumb to shrill wailings, he would only moan With half heard muttering, like an angry bull. But now, by such dark fortune overpowered, Foodless and dry, amid the quivering heap His steel hath quelled, all quietly he broods; And out of doubt his mind intends some harm:  Such words, such groans, burst from him. O my friends.— Therefore I hastened,—enter and give aid If aught ye can! Men thus forgone will oft Grow milder through the counsel of a friend.

\par \textbf{[page 53][342-376] AI. Teucer I call! Where ’s Teucer? Will he ne’er Come from the chase, but leave me to my doom?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Not madness now. Disclose him. Let us look. Haply the sight of us may calm his soul.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. There, then; I open to your view the form Of Aias, and his fortunes as they are.[AIAS is discovered}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. Dear comrades of the deep, whose truth and loveI 1 Stand forth alone unbroken in my woe, Behold what gory sea Of storm-lashed agony Doth round and round me flow!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. (to TEC.). Too true thy witness}
\par   for the fact cries out Wild thoughts were here and Reason’s lamp extinct.

\par \textbf{AI. Strong helpers of sea-speed, whose nimble handI 2 Plied hither the salt oar with circling stroke, No shepherd there was found To give the avenging wound. Come, lay me with the flock!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Speak no rash word! nor curing ill with ill Augment the plague of this calamity.}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. Mark ye the brave and bold,II 1 Whom none could turn of old, When once he set his face to the fierce fight? Now beasts that thought no harm Have felt this puissant arm. O laughter of my foes! O mockery of my might!}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. Aias, my lord! I entreat thee, speak not so!}

\par \textbf{AI. Thou here! Away! begone, and trouble me not! O! O!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Be softened! bear a steadier mind!}
\par

\par 

\par \textbf{[page 54][377-409] CH. Why vex thy heart with what is over and done? Do what we may, this ne’er will alter now.}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. Child of Laërtes old,II 2 Thou that dost still behold And still contrive all shapes of monstrous ill, Winding in foulest ways Through the army’s sinful maze,— Now even for pleasure thou may’st laugh thy fill.}

\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Nay, vaunt not. Look where thou art fallen.}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. Source where my life-blood springs, O Zeus, might I but slay That crafty plague, with those twin-sceptred kings, Then breathe my life away!}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. Pray thus, and pray that I too be no more! If thou wert gone, what were my life to me?}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. Darkness! my only light!III 1 O nether gloom, to me Brighter than morning to the wakeful eye! Take me to dwell with thee. Take me! What help? Zeus’ daughter with fell might Torments me sore. I may not look on high, Nor to the tribe of momentary men.— Oh, whither, then, Should it avail to fly? Ah! whither should I go and stay? All here is ruin. This mad prey Shames me for evermore}
\par   Vengeance is at the door; Yea, all the Achaean host, with armèd hand, Is ready at command To slay me o’er and o’er.

\par \textbf{[page 55][410-447] TEC. Woe ’s me! to hear from one so good and true Words he had scorned to utter in past days.}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. Grey firths of foaming brine,III 2 And ye, deep groves, that crown The sea-caves and long cliffs upon the shore, Too long did ye confine My life about the walls of Troia’s town}
\par   But no more now! a breathing man, no more! The wise in heart may duly learn that lore. Let Xanthus know, Whose waters neighbouring flow, And minister to Argive men:  One man he ne’er shall see again; One, I will vaunt it forth! Highest in warlike worth Of all Greek forms that Troia’s towers have eyed:  Now, shorn of all that pride, I lie thus low.

\par \textbf{CH. I know not how to let thee speak, nor how To silence thee. Such evils close thee round.}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. Ay me! Could human thought have prophesied My name would thus give echo to mine ill? ‘Ai’ now for Aias, doubly, trebly said, Sorts all too well to mark my misery; Whose father from this land of Troy, as noblest Of all the host, carrying the fairest prize, Came girt about with glory to his home. But I his son, not less of might than he, Nor poorer in the achievements of my hand, To this same region following in my prime, Am scouted by the Achaeans and destroyed. Yet know I one thing well. Had Peleus’ child, Living, adjudged his armour as a meed Of well-tried bravery, no grasp save mine Had clutched it. But the Atridae with mean craft Conveyed his heirloom to a wit-proud knave, Whilst Aias’ peerless prowess was despised. And had not this mine eye and mind distraught [page 56][448-486] Glanced from my purpose, ne’er again had they Perverted judgement. But the invincible Stern daughter of the Highest, with baneful eye, Even as mine arm descended, baffled me, And hurled upon my soul a frenzied plague, To stain my hand with these dumb victims’ blood. And those mine enemies exult in safety,— Not with my will; but where a God misguides, Strong arms are thwarted and the weakling lives. Now, what remains? Heaven hates me, ’tis too clear}
\par   The Grecian host abhor me:  Troy, with all This country round our camp, is my sworn foe. Shall I, across the Aegean sailing home, Leave these Atridae and their fleet forlorn? How shall I dare to front my father’s eye? How will he once endure to look on me, Denuded of the prize of high renown, Whose coronal stood sparkling on his brow? No! ’twere too dreadful. Then shall I advance Before the Trojan battlements, and there In single conflict doing valiantly Last die upon their spears? Nay, for by this I might perchance make Atreus’ offspring glad. That may not be imagined. I must find Some act to let my grey-haired father feel No heartless recreant once called him sire. Shame on the wight who when beset with ill Cares to live on in misery unrelieved. Can hour outlasting hour make less or more Of death? Whereby then can it furnish joy? That mortal weighs for nothing-worth with me, Whom Hope can comfort with her fruitless fire. Honour in life or honour in the grave Befits the noble heart. You hear my will.

\par \textbf{CH. From thine own spirit, Aias, all may tell, That utterance came, and none have prompted thee. Yet stay thy hurrying thought, and by thy friends Be ruled to loose this burden from thy mind.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. O my great master! heaviest of all woe Is theirs whose life is crushed beyond recall. [page 57][487-526] I, born of one the mightiest of the free And wealthiest in the Phrygian land, am now A captive. So Heaven willed, and thy strong arm Determined. Therefore, since the hour that made My being one with thine, I breathe for thee; And I beseech thee by the sacred fire Of home, and by the sweetness of the night When from thy captive I became thy bride, Leave me not guardless to the unworthy touch And cruel taunting of thine enemies’ For, shouldst thou die and leave us, then shall I Borne off by Argive violence with thy boy Eat from that day the bread of slavery. And some one of our lords shall smite me there With galling speech}
\par   Behold the concubine Of Aias, first of all the Greeks for might, How envied once, worn with what service now! So will they speak; and while my quailing heart Shall sink beneath its burden, clouds of shame Will dim thy glory and degrade thy race. Oh! think but of thy father, left to pine In doleful age, and let thy mother’s grief— Who, long bowed down with many a careful year, Prays oftentimes thou may’st return alive— O’er awe thee. Yea, and pity thine own son, Unsheltered in his boyhood, lorn of thee, With bitter foes to tend his orphanhood, Think, O my lord, what sorrow in thy death Thou send’st on him and me. For I have nought To lean to but thy life. My fatherland Thy spear hath ruined. Fate—not thou—hath sent My sire and mother to the home of death What wealth have I to comfort me for thee? What land of refuge? Thou art all my stay Oh, of me too take thought! Shall men have joy, And not remember? Or shall kindness fade? Say, can the mind be noble, where the stream Of gratitude is withered from the spring?

\par \textbf{CH. Aias, I would thy heart were touched like mine With pity; then her words would win thy praise.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 58][527-565] AI. My praise she shall not miss, if she perform My bidding with firm heart, and fail not here.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. Dear Aias, I will fail in nought thou bidst me.}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. Bring me my boy, that I may see his face.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. Oh, in my terror I conveyed him hence!}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. Clear of this mischief, mean’st thou? or for what?}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. Lest he might run to thee, poor child, and die.}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. That issue had been worthy of my fate!}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. But I kept watch to fence his life from harm.}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. ’Twas wisely done. I praise thy foresight there.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. Well, since ’tis so, how can I help thee now?}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. Give me to speak to him and see him near.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. He stands close by with servants tending him.}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. Then why doth he not come, but still delay?}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. Thy father calls thee, child. Come, lead him hither, Whichever of you holds him by the hand.}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. Moves he? or do thine accents idly fall?}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. See, where thy people bring him to thine eye.}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. Lift him to me}
\par   lift him! He will not fear At sight of this fresh havoc of the sword, If rightly he be fathered of my blood. Like some young colt he must be trained and taught To run fierce courses with his warrior sire. Be luckier than thy father, boy! but else Be like him, and thy life will not be low. One thing even now I envy thee, that none Of all this misery pierces to thy mind. For life is sweetest in the void of sense, Ere thou know joy or sorrow. But when this Hath found thee, make thy father’s enemies Feel the great parent in the valiant child. Meantime grow on in tender youthfulness, Nursed by light breezes, gladdening this thy mother. No Greek shall trample thee with brutal harm, That I know well, though I shall not be near— So stout a warder to protect thy life I leave in Teucer. He’ll not fail, though now He follow far the chase upon his foes. My trusty warriors, people of the sea, [page 59][566-596] Be this your charge, no less,—and bear to him My clear commandment, that he take this boy Home to my fatherland, and make him known To Telamon, and Eriboea too, My mother. Let him tend them in their age. And, for mine armour, let not that be made The award of Grecian umpires or of him Who ruined me. But thou, named of the shield, Eurysakes, hold mine, the unpierceable Seven-hided buckler, and by the well stitched thong Grasp firm and wield it mightily.—The rest Shall lie where I am buried.—Take him now, Quickly, and close the door. No tears! What! weep Before the tent? How women crave for pity! Make fast, I say. No wise physician dreams With droning charms to salve a desperate sore.

\par \textbf{CH. There sounds a vehement ardour in thy words That likes me not. I fear thy sharpened tongue.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. Aias, my lord, what act is in thy mind?}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. Inquire not, question not; be wise, thou’rt best.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. How my heart sinks! Oh, by thy child, by Heaven, I pray thee on my knees, forsake us not!}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. Thou troublest me. What! know’st thou not that Heaven Hath ceased to be my debtor from to-day?}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. Hush! Speak not so.}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. Speak thou to those that hear.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. Will you not hear me?}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. Canst thou not be still?}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. My fears, my fears!}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. (to the Attendants). Come, shut me in, I say.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. Oh, yet be softened!}
\par 

\par \textbf{AI. ’Tis a foolish hope, If thou deem’st now to mould me to thy will. [Aias is withdrawn. Exit Tecmessa}
\par 

\par  CHORUS.

\par \textbf{Island of glory! whom the glowing eyesI 1 Of all the wondering world immortalize, [page 60][597-648] Thou, Salamis, art planted evermore, Happy amid the wandering billows’ roar; While I—ah, woe the while!—this weary time, By the green wold where flocks from Ida stray, Lie worn with fruitless hours of wasted prime, Hoping—ah, cheerless hope!—to win my way Where Hades’ horrid gloom shall hide me from the day.}
\par 

\par \textbf{Aias is with me, yea, but crouching low,I 2 Where Heaven-sent madness haunts his overthrow, Beyond my cure or tendance}
\par   woful plight! Whom thou, erewhile, to head the impetuous fight, Sent’st forth, thy conquering champion. Now he feeds His spirit on lone paths, and on us brings Deep sorrow; and all his former peerless deeds Of prowess fall like unremembered things From Atreus’ loveless brood, this caitiff brace of kings.

\par \textbf{Ah! when his mother, full of days and bowedII 1 With hoary eld, shall hear his ruined mind, How will she mourn aloud! Not like the warbler of the dale, The bird of piteous wail, But in shrill strains far borne upon the wind, While on the withered breast and thin white hair Falls the resounding blow, the rending of despair.}
\par 

\par \textbf{Best hid in death were he whom madness drivesII 2 Remediless; if, through his father’s race Born to the noblest place Among the war-worn Greeks, he lives By his own light no more, Self-aliened from the self he knew before. Oh, hapless sire, what woe thine ear shall wound! One that of all thy line no life save this hath found.}
\par 

\par  Enter Aias with a bright sword, and Tecmessa, severally.

\par \textbf{AI. What change will never-terminable Time Not heave to light, what hide not from the day? What chance shall win men’s marvel? Mightiest oaths [page 61][649-689] Fall frustrate, and the steely-tempered will. Ay, and even mine, that stood so diamond-keen Like iron lately dipped, droops now dis-edged And weakened by this woman, whom to leave A widow with her orphan to my foes, Dulls me with pity. I will go to the baths And meadows near the cliff, and purging there My dark pollution, I will screen my soul From reach of Pallas’ grievous wrath. I will find Same place untrodden, and digging of the soil Where none shall see, will bury this my sword, Weapon of hate! for Death and Night to hold Evermore underground. For, since my hand Had this from Hector mine arch-enemy, No kindness have I known from Argive men. So true that saying of the bygone world, ‘A foe’s gift is no gift, and brings no good.’ Well, we will learn of Time. Henceforth I’ll bow To heavenly ordinance and give homage due To Atreus’ sons. Who rules, must be obeyed. Since nought so fierce and terrible but yields Place to Authority. Wild Winter’s snows Make way for bounteous Summer’s flowery tread, And Night’s sad orb retires for lightsome Day With his white steeds to illumine the glad sky. The furious storm-blast leaves the groaning sea Gently to rest. Yea, the all-subduer Sleep Frees whom he binds, nor holds enchained for aye. And shall not men be taught the temperate will? Yea, for I now know surely that my foe Must be so hated, as being like enough To prove a friend hereafter, and my friend So far shall have mine aid, as one whose love Will not continue ever. Men have found But treacherous harbour in companionship. Our ending, then, is peaceful. Thou, my girl, Go in and pray the Gods my heart’s desire Be all fulfilled. My comrades, join her here, Honouring my wishes; and if Teucer come, Bid him toward us be mindful, kind toward you. [page 62][690-718] I must go—whither I must go. Do ye But keep my word, and ye may learn, though now Be my dark hour, that all with me is well. [Exit towards the country. Tecmessa retires}

\par  CHORUS.

\par \textbf{A shudder of love thrills through me. Joy! I soar1 O Pan, wild Pan![They dance Come from Cyllenè hoar— Come from the snow drift, the rock-ridge, the glen! Leaving the mountain bare Fleet through the salt sea-air, Mover of dances to Gods and to men. Whirl me in Cnossian ways—thrid me the Nysian maze! Come, while the joy of the dance is my care! Thou too, Apollo, come Bright from thy Delian home, Bringer of day, Fly o’er the southward main Here in our hearts to reign, Loved to repose there and kindly to stay.}

\par \textbf{Horror is past. Our eyes have rest from pain.2 O Lord of Heaven![They dance Now blithesome day again Purely may smile on our swift-sailing fleet, Since, all his woe forgot, Aias now faileth not Aught that of prayer and Heaven-worship is meet. Time bringeth mighty aid—nought but in time doth fade}
\par   Nothing shall move me as strange to my thought. Aias our lord hath now Cleared his wrath-burdened brow Long our despair, Ceased from his angry feud And with mild heart renewed Peace and goodwill to the high-sceptred pair.

\par \textbf{[page 63][719-754]}
\par 

\par  Enter Messenger.

\par \textbf{MESSENGER. Friends, my first news is Teucer’s presence here, Fresh from the Mysian heights; who, as he came Right toward the generals’ quarter, was assailed With outcry from the Argives in a throng}
\par   For when they knew his motion from afar They swarmed around him, and with shouts of blame From each side one and all assaulted him As brother to the man who had gone mad And plotted ’gainst the host,—threatening aloud, Spite of his strength, he should be stoned, and die. —So far strife ran, that swords unscabbarded Crossed blades, till as it mounted to the height Age interposed with counsel, and it fell. But where is Aias to receive my word? Tidings are best told to the rightful ear.

\par \textbf{CH. Not in the hut, but just gone forth, preparing New plans to suit his newly altered mind.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Alas! Too tardy then was he who sped me hither; Or I have proved too slow a messenger.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. What point is lacking for thine errand’s speed?}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Teucer was resolute the man should bide Close held within-doors till himself should come.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Why, sure his going took the happiest turn And wisest, to propitiate Heaven’s high wrath.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. The height of folly lives in such discourse, If Calchas have the wisdom of a seer.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. What knowest thou of our state? What saith he? Tell.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. I can tell only what I heard and saw. Whilst all the chieftains and the Atridae twain Were seated in a ring, Calchas alone Rose up and left them, and in Teucer’s palm Laid his right hand full friendly; then out-spake With strict injunction by all means i’ the world To keep beneath yon covert this one day Your hero, and not suffer him to rove, [page 64][755-789] If he would see him any more alive. For through this present light—and ne’er again—- Holy Athena, so he said, will drive him Before her anger. Such calamitous woe Strikes down the unprofitable growth that mounts Beyond his measure and provokes the sky. ‘Thus ever,’ said the prophet, ‘must he fall Who in man’s mould hath thoughts beyond a man. And Aias, ere he left his father’s door, Made foolish answer to his prudent sire. ‘My son,’ said Telamon, ‘choose victory Always, but victory with an aid from Heaven.’ How loftily, how madly, he replied! ‘Father, with heavenly help men nothing worth May win success. But I am confident Without the Gods to pluck this glory down.’ So huge the boast he vaunted! And again When holy Pallas urged him with her voice To hurl his deadly spear against the foe, He turned on her with speech of awful sound}
\par   ‘Goddess, by other Greeks take thou thy stand; Where I keep rank, the battle ne’er shall break.’ Such words of pride beyond the mortal scope Have won him Pallas’ wrath, unlovely meed. But yet, perchance, so be it he live to-day, We, with Heaven’s succour, may restore his peace.’— Thus far the prophet, when immediately Teucer dispatched me, ere the assembly rose, Bearing to thee this missive to be kept With all thy care. But if my speed be lost, And Calchas’ word have power, the man is dead.

\par \textbf{CH. O trouble-tost Tecmessa, born to woe, Come forth and see what messenger is here! This news bites near the bone, a death to joy.}
\par 

\par  Enter TECMESSA.

\par \textbf{TEC. Wherefore again, when sorrow’s cruel storm Was just abating, break ye my repose?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. (pointing to the Messenger). Hear what he saith, and how he comes to bring [page 65][797-821] News of our Aias that hath torn my heart.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. Oh me! what is it, man? Am I undone?}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Thy case I know not; but of Aias this, That if he roam abroad, ’tis dangerous.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. He is, indeed, abroad. Oh! tell me quickly!}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. ’Tis Teucer’s strong command to keep him close Beneath this roof, nor let him range alone.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. But where is Teucer? and what means his word?}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Even now at hand, and eager to make known That Aias, if he thus go forth, must fall.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. Alas! my misery! Whence learned he this?}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. From Thestor’s prophet-offspring, who to-day Holds forth to Aias choice of life or death.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. Woe’s me! O friends, this desolating blow Is falling! Oh, stand forward to prevent! And some bring Teucer with more haste, while some Explore the western bays and others search Eastward to find your hero’s fatal path! For well I see I am cheated and cast forth From the old favour. Child, what shall I do? [Looking at EURYSAKES We must not stay. I too will fare along, go far as I have power. Come, let us go. Bestir ye! ’Tis no moment to sit still, If we would save him who now speeds to die.}

\par  AIAS (discovered alone).

\par \textbf{The sacrificer stands prepared,—and when More keen? Let me take time for thinking, too! This gift of Hector, whom of stranger men I hated most with heart and eyes, is set In hostile Trojan soil, with grinding hone Fresh-pointed, and here planted by my care [page 66][822-863] Thus firm, to give me swift and friendly death. Fine instrument, so much for thee! Then, first, Thou, for ’tis meet, great Father, lend thine aid. For no great gift I sue thee. Let some voice Bear Teucer the ill news, that none but he May lift my body, newly fallen in death About my bleeding sword, ere I be spied By some of those who hate me, and be flung To dogs and vultures for an outcast prey. So far I entreat thee, Lord of Heaven. And thou, Hermes, conductor of the shadowy dead, Speed me to rest, and when with this sharp steel I have cleft a sudden passage to my heart, At one swift bound waft me to painless slumber! But most be ye my helpers, awful Powers, Who know no blandishments, but still perceive All wicked deeds i’ the world—strong, swift, and sure, Avenging Furies, understand my wrong, See how my life is ruined, and by whom. Come, ravin on Achaean flesh—spare none; Rage through the camp!—Last, thou that driv’st thy course Up yon steep Heaven, thou Sun, when thou behold’st My fatherland, checking thy golden rein, Report my fall, and this my fatal end, To my old sire, and the poor soul who tends him. Ah, hapless one! when she shall hear this word, How she will make the city ring with woe! ’Twere from the business idly to condole. To work, then, and dispatch. O Death! O Death! Now come, and welcome! Yet with thee, hereafter, I shall find close communion where I go.

\par 

\par \textbf{TEC. No eye shall see him.

\par \textbf{TEC. Ay, let them laugh and revel o’er his fall! Perchance, albeit in life they missed him not, Dead, they will cry for him in straits of war. For dullards know not goodness in their hand, Nor prize the jewel till ’tis cast away. To me more bitter than to them ’twas sweet, His death to him was gladsome, for he found The lot he longed for, his self-chosen doom. What cause have they to laugh? Heaven, not their crew, Hath glory by his death. Then let Odysseus Insult with empty pride. To him and his Aias is nothing; but to me, to me, He leaves distress and sorrow in his room!}

\par 

\par \textbf{TEU. O sorest spectacle mine eyes e’er saw! Woe for my journey hither, of all ways Most grievous to my heart, since I was ware, Dear Aias, of thy doom, and sadly tracked Thy footsteps. For there darted through the host, As from some God, a swift report of thee That thou wert lost in death. I, hapless, heard, And mourned even then for that whose presence kills me. Ay me! But come, Unveil. Let me behold my misery. [The corpse of AIAS is uncovered O sight unbearable! Cruelly brave! Dying, what store of griefs thou sow’st for me! Where, amongst whom of mortals, can I go, That stood not near thee in thy troublous hour? Will Telamon, my sire and thine, receive me With radiant countenance and favouring brow [page 71][1010-1046] Returning without thee? Most like! being one Who smiles no more, yield Fortune what she may. Will he hide aught or soften any word, Rating the bastard of his spear-won thrall, Whose cowardice and dastardy betrayed Thy life, dear Aias,—or my murderous guile, To rob thee of thy lordship and thy home? Such greeting waits me from the man of wrath, Whose testy age even without cause would storm. Last, I shall leave my land a castaway, Thrust forth an exile, and proclaimed a slave; So should I fare at home. And here in Troy My foes are many and my comforts few. All these things are my portion through thy death. Woe’s me, my heart! how shall I bear to draw thee, O thou ill-starr’d! from this discoloured blade, Thy self-shown slayer? Didst thou then perceive Dead Hector was at length to be thine end?— I pray you all, consider these two men. Hector, whose gift from Aias was a girdle, Tight-braced therewith to the car’s rim, was dragged And scarified till he breathed forth his life. And Aias with this present from his foe Finds through such means his death-fall and his doom. Say then what cruel workman forged the gifts, But Fury this sharp sword, Hell that bright band? In this, and all things human, I maintain, Gods are the artificers. My thought is said. And if there be who cares not for my thought, Let him hold fast his faith and leave me mine.}

\par 

\par \textbf{MEN. My will, and his whose word is sovereign here.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEU. May we not know the reasons of your will?}
\par 

\par \textbf{MEN. Because he, whom we trusted to have brought To lend us loyal help with heart and hand, Proved in the trial a worse than Phrygian foe; Who lay in wait for all the host by night, And sallied forth in arms to shed our blood; That, had not one in Heaven foiled this attempt, Our lot had been to lie as he doth here Dead and undone for ever, while he lived And flourished. Heaven hath turned this turbulence To fall instead upon the harmless flock. Wherefore no strength of man shall once avail To encase his body with a seemly tomb, But outcast on the wide and watery sand, He’ll feed the birds that batten on the shore. Nor let thy towering spirit therefore rise In threatening wrath. Wilt thou or not, our hand Shall rule him dead, howe’er he braved us living, And that by force; for never would he yield, Even while he lived, to words from me. And yet It shows base metal when the subject-wight Deigns not to hearken to the chief in power. Since without settled awe, neither in states Can laws have rightful sway, nor can a host Be governed with due wisdom, if no fear Or wholesome shame be there to shield its safety. And though a man wax great in thews and bulk, Let him be warned}
\par   a trifling harm may ruin him. Whoever knows respect and honour both Stands free from risk of dark vicissitude. But whereso pride and licence have their fling, Be sure that state will one day lose her course And founder in the abysm. Let fear have place [page 73][1084-1122] Still where it ought, say I, nor let men think To do their pleasure and not bide the pain. That wheel comes surely round. Once Aias flamed With insolent fierceness. Now I mount in pride, And loudly bid thee bury him not, lest burying Thy brother thou be burrowing thine own grave.

\par \textbf{CH. Menelaüs, make not thy philosophy A platform whence to insult the valiant dead.}

Come, tell it o’er again,—said you ye brought My brother bound to aid you with his power? Sailed he not forth of his own sovereign will? Where is thy voucher of command o’er him? Where of thy right o’er those that followed him? Sparta, not we, shall buckle to thy sway. ’Twas written nowhere in the bond of rule That thou shouldst check him rather than he thee. Thou sailedst under orders, not in charge Of all, much less of Aias. Then pursue Thy limited direction, and chastise, In haughty phrase, the men who fear thy nod. But I will bury Aias, whether thou Or the other general give consent or no. ’Tis not for me to tremble at your word. Not to reclaim thy wife, like those poor souls Thou flll’st with labour, issued this man forth, But caring for his oath, and not for thee, Or any other nobody. Then come With heralds all arow, and bring the man Called king of men with thee! For thy sole noise I budge not, wert thou twenty times thy name.}

\par \textbf{AG. And so I hear thou’lt stretch thy mouth agape With big bold words against us undismayed— Thou, the she-captive’s offspring! High would scale Thy voice, and pert would be thy strutting gait, Were but thy mother noble; since, being naught, So stiff thou stand’st for him who is nothing now, And swear’st we came not as commanders here Of all the Achaean navy, nor of thee; But Aias sailed, thou say’st, with absolute right. Must we endure detraction from a slave? What was the man thou noisest here so proudly? Have I not set my foot as firm and far? Or stood his valour unaccompanied In all this host? High cause have we to rue That prize-encounter for Pelides’ arms, Seeing Teucer’s sentence stamps our knavery For all to know it; and nought will serve but ye, Being vanquished, kick at the award that passed By voice of the majority in the court, And either pelt us with rude calumnies, Or stab at us, ye laggards! with base guile. Howbeit, these ways will never help to build The wholesome order of established law, If men shall hustle victors from their right, And mix the hindmost rabble with the van. That craves repression. Not by bulky size, Or shoulders’ breadth, the perfect man is known; But wisdom gives chief power in all the world. The ox hath a huge broadside, yet is held Right in the furrow by a slender goad; Which remedy, I perceive, will pass ere long To visit thee, unless thy wisdom grow; Who hast uttered forth such daring insolence For the pale shadow of a vanished man. Learn modestly to know thy place and birth, And bring with thee some freeborn advocate To plead thy cause before us in thy room. [page 78][1262-1300] I understand not in the barbarous tongue, And all thy talk sounds nonsense to mine ear.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Would ye might both have sense to curb your ire! No better hope for either can I frame.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TEU. Fie! How doth gratitude when men are dead Prove renegade and swiftly pass away! This Agamemnon hath no slightest word Of kind remembrance any more for thee, Aias, who oftentimes for his behoof Hast jeoparded thy life in labour of war. Now all is clean forgotten and out of mind. Thou who hast multiplied words void of sense, Hast thou no faintest memory of the time When who but Aias came and rescued you Already locked within the toils,—all lost, The rout began}
\par   when close abaft the ships The torches flared, and o’er the bootless trench Hector was bounding high to board our fleet? Who stayed that onset? Was not Aias he? Whom thou deny’st to have once set foot by thine. Find ye no merit there? And once again When he met Hector singly, man to man, Not by your bidding, but the lottery’s choice, His lot, that skulked not low adown i’ the heap, A moist earth-clod, but sure to spring in air, And first to clear the plumy helmet’s brim. Yes, Aias was the man, and I too there Kept rank, the ‘barbarous mother’s servile son.’ I pity thee the blindness of that word. Who was thy father’s father? A barbarian, Pelops, the Phrygian, if you trace him far! And what was Atreus, thine own father? One Who served his brother with the abominable Dire feast of his own flesh. And thou thyself Cam’st from a Cretan mother, whom her sire Caught with a man who had no right in her And gave dumb fishes the polluted prey. Such was thy race. What is the race thou spurnest? My father, Telamon, of all the host Being foremost proved in valour, took as prize [page 79][1301-1337] My mother for his mate:  a princess she, Born of Laomedon; Alcmena’s son Gave her to grace him—a triumphant meed. Thus royally descended and thus brave, Shall I renounce the brother of my blood, Or suffer thee to thrust him in his woes Far from all burial, shameless that thou art? Be sure that, if ye cast him forth, ye’ll cast Three bodies more beside him in one spot; For nobler should I find it here to die In open quarrel for my kinsman’s weal, Than for thy wife—or Menelaüs’, was ’t? Consider then, not my case, but your own. For if you harm me you will wish some day To have been a coward rather than dare me.

\par \textbf{OD. Then hear me in Heaven’s name! Be not so hard Thus without ruth tombless to cast him forth; Nor be so vanquished by a vehement will, That to thy hate even Justice’ self must bow. I, too, had him for my worst enemy, Since I gained mastery o’er Pelides’ arms. [page 80][1338-1373] But though he used me so, I ne’er will grudge For his proud scorn to yield him thus much honour, That, save Achilles’ self, I have not seen So noble an Argive on the fields of Troy.

Wherefore may he who rules in yon wide heaven, And the unforgetting Fury-spirit, and she, Justice, who crowns the right, so ruin them With cruellest destruction, even as they Thought ruthlessly to rob him of his tomb! For thee, revered Laërtes’ lineal seed, I fear to admit thy hand unto this rite, Lest we offend the spirit that is gone.

Let the cleansing waters flow; Brightly flame the fire below! Others in a stalwart throng From his chamber bear along [page 82][1408-1419] All the arms he wont to wield Save alone the mantling shield. Thou with me thy strength employ, Lifting this thy father, boy; Hold his frame with tender heed— Still the gashed veins darkly bleed. Who professes here to love him?

\par  The following also appear, but do not speak:
 
\par  [page 84] Laius, the descendant of Cadmus, and king of Thebes (or Thebè), had been told by an oracle that if a son were born to him by his wife Jocasta the boy would be his father’s death.

\par  Under such auspices, Oedipus was born, and to elude the prophecy was exposed by his parents on Mount Cithaeron. But he was saved by a compassionate shepherd, and became the adopted son of Polybus, king of Corinth. When he grew up he was troubled by a rumour that he was not his father’s son. He went to consult the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, and was told—not of his origin but of his destiny—that he should be guilty of parricide and incest.

\par  He was too horror-stricken to return to Corinth, and as he travelled the other way, he met Laius going from Thebes to Delphi. The travellers quarrelled and the son killed his father, but knew not whom he had slain. He went onward till he came near Thebes, where the Sphinx was making havoc of the noblest citizens, devouring all who failed to solve her riddle. But Oedipus succeeded and overcame her, and, as Laius did not return, was rewarded with the regal sceptre,—and with the hand of the queen.

\par  He reigned nobly and prosperously, and lived happily with Jocasta, by whom he had four children.

\par  But after some years a plague descended on the people, and Apollo, on being inquired of, answered that it was for Laius’ death. The act of regicide must be avenged. Oedipus undertakes the task of discovering the murderer,—and in the same act discovers his own birth, and the fulfilment of both the former prophecies.

\par  Jocasta hangs herself, and Oedipus in his despair puts out his eyes.

Great ruler of my country, thou beholdest The different ages of our flock who here Are gathered round thine altar,—some, whose wing Hath not yet ventured far from home, and some Burdened with many years, priests of the Gods, Myself the arch priest of Zeus, and these fresh youths, A chosen few. Others there are who crowd The holy agora and the temples twain Of Pallas, and Ismenus’ hallowed fires, A suppliant host. For, as thyself perceivest, Our city is tempest tost, and all too weak To lift above the waves her weary prow That plunges in a rude and ravenous sea. Earth’s buds are nipped, withering the germs within, Our cattle lose their increase, and our wives Have fruitless travail; and that scourge from Heaven, The fiery Pestilence abhorred of men, Descending on our people with dire stroke [page 86][27-65] Lays waste the Home of Cadmus, while dark Death Wins ample tribute of laments and groans. We kneel, then, at thy hearth; not likening thee Unto the gods, I nor these children here, But of men counting thee the first in might Whether to cope with earthly casualty Or visiting of more than earthly Power. Thou, in thy coming to this Theban land, Didst take away the hateful tax we paid To that stern songstress,—aided not by us With hint nor counsel, but, as all believe, Gifted from heaven with life-restoring thought. Now too, great Oedipus of matchless fame, We all uplift our suppliant looks to thee, To find some help for us, whether from man, Or through the prompting of a voice Divine. Experienced counsel, we have seen and know, Hath ever prosperous issue. Thou, then, come, Noblest of mortals, give our city rest From sorrow! come, take heed! seeing this our land Now calls thee Saviour for thy former zeal; And ’twere not well to leave this memory Of thy great reign among Cadmean men, ‘He raised us up, only again to fall.’ Let the salvation thou hast wrought for us Be flawless and assured! As once erewhile Thy lucky star gave us prosperity, Be the same man to-day. Wouldst thou be king In power, as in command, ’tis greater far To rule a people than a wilderness. Since nought avails or city or buttressed wall Or gallant vessel, if unmanned and void.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Ye touch me to the core. Full well I know Your trouble and your desire. Think not, my sons, I have no feeling of your misery! Yet none of you hath heaviness like mine. Your grief is held within the single breast Of each man severally. My burdened heart Mourns for myself, for Thebè, and for you. Your coming hath not roused me from repose}
\par   [page 87][66-102] I have watched, and bitterly have wept; my mind Hath travelled many a labyrinth of thought. And now I have tried in act the only plan Long meditation showed me. I have sent The brother of my queen, Menoeceus’ son, Creon, to learn, in Phoebus’ Delphian Hall, What word or deed of mine may save this city. And when I count the time, I am full of pain To guess his speed; for he is absent long, Beyond the limit of expectancy. But when he shall appear, base then were I In aught to disobey the voice of Heaven.

\par \textbf{PR. Lo, in good time, crowning thy gracious word, ’Tis told me by these youths, Creon draws near.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Apollo! may his coming be as blest With saving fortune, as his looks are bright.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PR. Sure he brings joyful news; else had he ne’er Worn that full wreath of thickly-berried bay.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. We have not long to doubt. He can hear now.}
\par 

\par  Enter CREON.

\par \textbf{Son of Menoeceus, brother of my queen, What answer from Apollo dost thou bring?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CREON. Good; for my message is that even our woes, When brought to their right issue, shall be well.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. What saith the oracle? Thy words so far Neither embolden nor dishearten me.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Say, must I tell it with these standing by, Or go within? I am ready either way.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Speak forth to all. The burden of their grief Weighs more on me than my particular fear.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CE. My lips shall utter what the God hath said. Sovereign Apollo clearly bids us drive Forth from this region an accursed thing (For such is fostered in the land and stains Our sacred clime), nor cherish it past cure.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. What is the fault, and how to be redressed?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. By exile, or by purging blood with blood. Since blood it is that shakes us with this storm.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Whose murder doth Apollo thus reveal?}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 88][103-137] CR. My gracious lord, before thy prosperous reign King Laius was the leader of our land.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Though I ne’er saw him, I have heard, and know.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Phoebus commands us now to punish home, Whoe’er they are, the authors of his death.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. But they, where are they? Where shall now be read The fading record of this ancient guilt?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR He saith, ’tis in this land. And what is sought Is found, while things uncared for glide away.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. But where did Laius meet this violent end? At home, afield, or on some foreign soil?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. He had left us, as he said, to visit Delphi; But nevermore returned since he set forth.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. And was there none, no fellow traveller, To see, and tell the tale, and help our search?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. No, they were slain; save one, who, flying in fear, Had nought to tell us but one only thing.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. What was that thing? A little door of hope, Once opened, may discover much to view.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. A random troop of robbers, meeting him, Outnumbered and o’erpowered him. So ’twas told.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. What robber would have ventured such a deed, If unsolicited with bribes from hence?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. We thought of that. But Laius being dead, We found no helper in our miseries.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. When majesty was fallen, what misery Could hinder you from searching out the truth?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. A present trouble had engrossed our care. The riddling Sphinx compelled us to observe The moment’s grief, neglecting things unknown.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. But I will track this evil to the spring And clear it to the day. Most worthily Doth great Apollo, worthily dost thou Prompt this new care for the unthought of dead. And me too ye shall find a just ally, Succouring the cause of Phoebus and the land. Since, in dispelling this dark cloud, I serve [page 89][137-170] No indirect or distant claim on me, But mine own life, for he that slew the king May one day turn his guilty hand ’gainst me With equal rage. In righting Laius, then, I forward mine own cause.—Now, children, rise From the altar-steps, and lift your suppliant boughs, And let some other summon to this place All Cadmus’ people, and assure them, I Will answer every need. This day shall see us Blest with glad fortune through God’s help, or fallen.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PR. Rise then, my children. Even for this we came Which our good lord hath promised of himself. Only may Phoebus, who hath sent this word, With healing power descend, and stay the plague. [Exeunt severally}
\par 

\par  CHORUS (entering).

\par \textbf{Kind voice of Heaven, soft-breathing from the heightI 1 Of Pytho’s opulent home to Thebè bright, What wilt thou bring to day? Ah, Delian Healer, say! My heart hangs on thy word with trembling awe}
\par   What new giv’n law, Or what returning in Time’s circling round Wilt thou unfold? Tell us, immortal sound, Daughter of golden Hope, tell us, we pray, we pray!

\par \textbf{First, child of Zeus, Pallas, to thee appealing,I 2 Then to sweet Artemis, thy sister, kneeling, Who with benignant hand Still guards our sacred land, Throned o’er the circling mart that hears her praise, And thou, whose rays Pierce evil from afar, ho! come and save, Ye mighty three! if e’er before ye drave The threatening fire of woe from Thebè, come to day!}
\par 

\par \textbf{For ah! the griefs that on me weighII 1 Are numberless; weak are my helpers all, [page 90][170-215] And thought finds not a sword to fray This hated pestilence from hearth or hall. Earth’s blossoms blasted fall}
\par   Nor can our women rise From childbed after pangs and cries; But flocking more and more Toward the western shore, Soul after soul is known to wing her flight, Swifter than quenchless flame, to the far realm of Night.

\par \textbf{So deaths innumerable abound.II 2 My city’s sons unpitied lie around Over the plague-encumbered ground And wives and matrons old on every hand Along the altar-strand Groaning in saddest grief Pour supplication for relief. Loud hymns are sounding clear With wailing voices near. Then, golden daughter of the heavenly sire, Send bright-eyed Succour forth to drive away this fire.}
\par 

\par \textbf{And swiftly speed afar,III 1 Windborne on backward car, The viewless fiend who scares me with wild cries, To oarless Thracian tide, Of ocean-chambers wide, About the bed where Amphitritè lies. Day blights what night hath spared. O thou whose hand Wields lightning, blast him with thy thundrous brand.}
\par 

\par \textbf{Shower from the golden stringIII 2 Thine arrows Lycian King! O Phoebus, let thy fiery lances fly Resistless, as they rove Through Xanthus’ mountain-grove! O Thoeban Bacchus of the lustrous eye, With torch and trooping Maenads and bright crown Blaze on thee god whom all in Heaven disown. [OEDIPUS has entered during the Choral song}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 91][216-251] OED. Your prayers are answered. Succour and relief Are yours, if ye will heed my voice and yield What help the plague requires. Hear it from me, Who am hitherto a stranger to the tale, As to the crime. Being nought concerned therewith, I could not of myself divine the truth. But now, as one adopted to your state, To all of you Cadmeans I speak this}
\par   Whoe’er among you knoweth the murderer Of Laius, son of royal Labdacus, Let him declare the deed in full to me. First, if the man himself be touched with fear, Let him depart, carrying the guilt away; No harm shall follow him: —he shall go free. Or if there be who knows another here, Come from some other country, to have wrought This murder, let him speak. Reward from me And store of kind remembrance shall be his. But if ye are silent, and one present here Who might have uttered this, shall hold his peace, As fearing for himself, or for his friend, What then shall be performed, hear me proclaim. I here prohibit all within this realm Whereof I wield the sceptre and sole sway, To admit the murderer, whosoe’er he be, Within their houses, or to speak with him, Or share with him in vow or sacrifice Or lustral rite. All men shall thrust him forth, Our dark pollution, so to me revealed By this day’s oracle from Pytho’s cell. So firm is mine allegiance to the God And your dead sovereign in this holy war. Now on the man of blood, whether he lurk In lonely guilt, or with a numerous band, I here pronounce this curse: —Let his crushed life Wither forlorn in hopeless misery. Next, I pray Heaven, should he or they be housed With mine own knowledge in my home, that I May suffer all I imprecate on them. [page 92][252-287] Last, I enjoin each here to lend his aid For my sake, and the God’s, and for your land Reft of her increase and renounced by Heaven. It was not right, when your good king had fallen, Although the oracle were silent still, To leave this inquisition unperformed. Long since ye should have purged the crime. But now I, to whom fortune hath transferred his crown, And given his queen in marriage,—yea, moreover, His seed and mine had been one family Had not misfortune trampled on his head Cutting him off from fair posterity,— All this being so, I will maintain his cause As if my father’s, racking means and might To apprehend the author of the death Of Laius, son to Labdacus, and heir To Polydorus and to Cadmus old, And proud Agenor of the eldest time. Once more, to all who disobey in this May Heaven deny the produce of the ground And offspring from their wives, and may they pine With plagues more horrible than this to-day. But for the rest of you Cadmean men, Who now embrace my word, may Righteousness, Strong to defend, and all the Gods for aye Watch over you for blessing in your land.

\par \textbf{LEADER OF CH. Under the shadow of thy curse, my lord, I will speak. I slew him not, nor can I show The man who slew. Phoebus, who gave the word, Should name the guilty one.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Thy thought is just, But man may not compel the Gods.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Again, That failing, I perceive a second way.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Were there a third, spare not to speak it forth.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. I know of one alone whose kingly mind Sees all King Phoebus sees—Tirésias,—he Infallibly could guide us in this quest.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. That doth not count among my deeds undone. [page 93][288-321] By Creon’s counsel I have sent twice o’er To fetch him, and I muse at his delay.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. The rumour that remains is old and dim.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. What rumour? Let no tale be left untried.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. ’Twas said he perished by some wandering band.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. But the one witness is removed from ken.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Well, if the man be capable of fear, He’ll not remain when he hath heard thy curse.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Words have no terror for the soul that dares Such doings.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Yet lives one who shall convict him. For look where now they lead the holy seer, Whom sacred Truth inspires alone of men.}
\par 

\par  Enter TIRESIAS.

\par \textbf{OED. O thou whose universal thought commands All knowledge and all mysteries, in Heaven And on the earth beneath, thy mind perceives, Tirésias, though thine outward eye be dark, What plague is wasting Thebè, who in thee, Great Sir, finds her one saviour, her sole guide. Phoebus (albeit the messengers perchance Have told thee this) upon our sending sent This answer back, that no release might come From this disaster, till we sought and found And slew the murderers of king Laius, Or drave them exiles from our land. Thou, then, Withhold not any word of augury Or other divination which thou knowest, But rescue Thebè, and thyself, and me, And purge the stain that issues from the dead. On thee we lean}
\par   and ’tis a noble thing To use what power one hath in doing good.

\par \textbf{TIRESIAS. Ah! terrible is knowledge to the man Whom knowledge profits not. This well I knew, But had forgotten. Else I ne’er had come.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Why dost thou bring a mind so full of gloom?}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. Let me go home. Thy part and mine to-day Will best be borne, if thou obey me in that.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 94][322-356] OED. Disloyal and ungrateful! to deprive The state that reared thee of thine utterance now.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. Thy speech, I see, is foiling thine intent; And I would shield me from the like mishap. (Going.)}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Nay, if thou knowest, turn thee not away}
\par   All here with suppliant hands importune thee.

\par \textbf{TI. Yea, for ye all are blind. Never will I Reveal my woe;—mine, that I say not, thine.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. So, then, thou hast the knowledge of the crime And wilt not tell, but rather wouldst betray This people, and destroy thy fatherland!}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. You press me to no purpose. I’ll not pain Thee, nor myself. Thou wilt hear nought from me.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. How? Miscreant! Thy stubbornness would rouse Wrath in a breast of stone. Wilt thou yet hold That silent, hard, impenetrable mien?}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. You censure me for my harsh mood. Your own Dwells unsuspected with you. Me you blame!}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Who can be mild and gentle, when thou speakest Such words to mock this people?}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. It will come}
\par   Although I bury it in silence here.

\par \textbf{OED. Must not the King be told of what will come?}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. No word from me. At this, an if thou wilt, Rage to the height of passionate vehemence.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Ay, and my passion shall declare my thought. ’Tis clear to me as daylight, thou hast been The arch-plotter of this deed; yea, thou hast done All but the actual blow. Hadst thou thy sight, I had proclaimed thee the sole murderer.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. Ay, say’st thou so?—I charge thee to abide By thine own ordinance; and from this hour Speak not to any Theban nor to me. Thou art the vile polluter of the land.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. O void of shame! What wickedness is this? What power will give thee refuge for such guilt?}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. The might of truth is scatheless. I am free.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 95][357-392] OED. Whence came the truth to thee? Not from thine art.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. From thee, whose rage impelled my backward tongue.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Speak it once more, that I may know the drift.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. Was it so dark? Or wouldst thou tempt me further?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. I cannot say ’twas clear. Speak it again.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. I say thou art the murderer whom thou seekest.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Again that baleful word! But thou shalt rue.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. Shall I add more, to aggravate thy wrath?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. All is but idleness. Say what thou wilt.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. I tell thee thou art living unawares In shameful commerce with thy near’st of blood, Ignorant of the abyss wherein thou liest.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Think you to triumph in offending still?}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. If Truth have power.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. She hath, but not for thee. Blind as thou art in eyes and ears and mind.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. O miserable reproach, which all who now Behold thee, soon shall thunder forth on thee!}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Nursed in unbroken night, thou canst not harm Or me, or any man who seeth the day.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. No, not from me proceeds thy fall; the God, Who cares for this, is able to perform it.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Came this device from Creon or thyself?}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. Not Creon}
\par   thou art thy sole enemy.

\par \textbf{OED. O wealth and sovereign power and high success Attained through wisdom and admired of men, What boundless jealousies environ you! When for this rule, which to my hand the State Committed unsolicited and free, Creon, my first of friends, trusted and sure, Would undermine and hurl me from my throne, Meanly suborning such a mendicant Botcher of lies, this crafty wizard rogue, Blind in his art, and seeing but for gain. Where are the proofs of thy prophetic power? How came it, when the minstrel-hound was here, This folk had no deliverance through thy word? [page 96][393-426] Her snare could not be loosed by common wit, But needed divination and deep skill; No sign whereof proceeded forth from thee Procured through birds or given by God, till I, The unknowing traveller, overmastered her, The stranger Oedipus, not led by birds, But ravelling out the secret by my thought}
\par   Whom now you study to supplant, and trust To stand as a supporter of the throne Of lordly Creon,—To your bitter pain Thou and the man who plotted this will hunt Pollution forth.—But for thy reverend look Thou hadst atoned thy trespass on the spot.

\par \textbf{CH. Your friends would humbly deprecate the wrath That sounds both in your speech, my lord, and his. That is not what we need, but to discern How best to solve the heavenly oracle.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. Though thou art king and lord, I claim no less Lordly prerogative to answer thee. Speech is my realm; Apollo rules my life, Not thou. Nor need I Creon to protect me. Now, then}
\par   my blindness moves thy scorn: —thou hast Thy sight, and seest not where thou art sunk in evil, What halls thou dost inhabit, or with whom:  Know’st not from whence thou art—nay, to thy kin, Buried in death and here above the ground, Unwittingly art a most grievous foe. And when thy father’s and thy mother’s curse With fearful tread shall drive thee from the land, On both sides lashing thee,—thine eye so clear Beholding darkness in that day,—oh, then, What region will not shudder at thy cry? What echo in all Cithaeron will be mute, When thou perceiv’st, what bride-song in thy hall Wafted thy gallant bark with nattering gale To anchor,—where? And other store of ill Thou seest not, that shall show thee as thou art, Merged with thy children in one horror of birth. Then rail at noble Creon, and contemn [page 97][427-460] My sacred utterance! No life on earth More vilely shall be rooted out, than thine.

\par \textbf{OED. Must I endure such words from him? Begone! Off to thy ruin, and with speed! Away, And take thy presence from our palace-hall!}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. Had you not sent for me, I ne’er had come.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. I knew not thou wouldst utter folly here, Else never had I brought thee to my door.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. To thee I am foolish, then; but to the pair Who gave thee life, I was wise.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Hold, go not! who? Who gave me being?}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. To-day shall bring to light Thy birth and thy destruction.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Wilt thou still Speak all in riddles and dark sentences?}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. Methought thou wert the man to find them out.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Ay! Taunt me with the gift that makes me great.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. And yet this luck hath been thy overthrow.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. I care not, since I rescued this fair town.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. Then I will go. Come, sirrah, guide me forth!}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Be it so! For standing here you vex our eye, But, you being gone, our trouble goes with you.}
\par 

\par \textbf{TI. I go, but I will speak. Why should I fear Thy frown? Thou ne’er canst ruin me. The word Wherefore I came, is this}
\par   The man you seek With threatening proclamation of the guilt Of Laius’ blood, that man is here to-day, An alien sojourner supposed from far, But by-and-by he shall be certified A true-born Theban:  nor will such event Bring him great joy; for, blind from having sight And beggared from high fortune, with a staff In stranger lands he shall feel forth his way; Shown living with the children of his loins, Their brother and their sire, and to the womb That bare him, husband-son, and, to his father, Parricide and corrival. Now go in, [page 98][461-502] Ponder my words; and if thou find them false, then say my power is naught in prophecy. [Exeunt severally

\par  CHORUS.

\par \textbf{Whom hath the voice from Delphi’s rocky throneI 1 Loudly declared to have done Horror unnameable with murdering hand? With speed of storm-swift car ’Tis time he fled afar With mighty footstep hurrying from the land. For, armed with lightning brand, The son of Zeus assails him with fierce bounds, Hunting with Death’s inevitable hounds.}
\par 

\par \textbf{Late from divine Parnassus’ snow-capped heightI 2 This utterance sprang to light, To track by every path the man unknown. Through woodland caverns deep And o’er the rocky steep Harbouring in caves he roams the wild alone, With none to share his moan. Shunning that prophet-voice’s central sound, Which ever lives, and haunts him, hovering round.}
\par 

\par \textbf{The reverend Seer hath stirred me with strange awe.II 1 Gainsay I cannot, nor yet think him true. I know not how to speak. My fluttering heart In wild expectancy sees nothing clear. Things past and future with the present doubt Are shrouded in one mist. What quarrel lay ’Twixt Cadmus’ issue and Corinthus’ heir Was never shown me, from old times till now, By one on whose sure word I might rely In running counter to the King’s fair fame, To wreak for Laius that mysterious death.}
\par 

\par \textbf{Zeus and Apollo scan the ways of menII 2 With perfect vision. But of mortals here That soothsayers are more inspired than I What certain proof is given? A man through wit May pass another’s wisdom in the race. [page 99][503-542] But never, till I see the word fulfilled, Will I confirm their clamour ’gainst the King. In open day the female monster came}
\par   Then perfect witness made his wisdom clear. Thebè hath tried him and delights in him. Wherefore my heart shall still believe him good.

\par \textbf{CR. Citizens, hearing of dire calumny Denounced on me by Oedipus the King, I am here to make loud protest. If he think, In this embroilment of events, one word Or deed of mine hath wrought him injury, I am not careful to prolong my life Beneath such imputation. For it means No trifling danger, but disastrous harm, Making my life dishonoured in the state, And meanly thought of by my friends and you.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Perchance ’twas but the sudden flash of wrath, Not the deliberate judgement of the soul.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Who durst declare it, that Tirésias spake False prophecies, set on to this by me?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Such things were said, I know not how advised.}

\par \textbf{CR. And were the eyes and spirit not distraught, When the tongue uttered this to ruin me?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. I cannot say. To what my betters do I am blind. But see, the King comes forth again.}

\par  Enter OEDIPUS.

\par \textbf{OED. Insolent, art thou here? Hadst thou the face To bring thy boldness near my palace-roof, Proved as thou art to have contrived my death And laid thy robber hands upon my state? Tell me, by heaven, had you seen in me A coward or a fool, when you planned this?— Deemed you I should be blind to your attempt Craftily creeping on, or, when perceived, Not ward it off? Is’t not a silly scheme, To think to compass without troops of friends Power, that is only won by wealth and men?}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 100][543-578] CR. Wilt them be counselled? Hear as much in turn As thou hast spoken, and then thyself be judge.}

\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Thine is a shallow judgement, if thou thinkest Thou canst abuse thy kinsman and be free.}

\par \textbf{CR. A rightful sentence. But I fain would learn What wrong is that you speak of?}

\par 

\par \textbf{OED. There is your villany in breaking fealty.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Not so, if thou wouldst reason with thyself As I do. First consider one thing well}
\par   Who would choose rule accompanied with fear Before safe slumbers with an equal sway? ’Tis not my nature, no, nor any man’s, Who follows wholesome thoughts, to love the place Of domination rather than the power. Now, without fear, I have my will from thee; But were I king, I should do much unwillingly. How then can I desire to be a king, When masterdom is mine without annoy? Delusion hath not gone so far with me As to crave more than honour joined with gain. Now all men hail me happy, all embrace me; All who have need of thee, call in my aid; For thereupon their fortunes wholly turn. How should I leave this substance for that show? No man of sense can harbour thoughts of crime. Such vain ambition hath no charm for me, Nor could I bear to lend it countenance. If you would try me, go and ask again If I brought Phoebus’ answer truly back. Nay more, should I be found to have devised Aught in collusion with the seer, destroy me, Not by one vote, but two, mine own with thine. But do not on a dim suspicion blame me Of thy mere will. To darken a good name Without clear cause is heinous wickedness; And to cast off a worthy friend I call No less a folly than to fling away What most we love, the life within our breast. The certainty of this will come with time; For time alone can clear the righteous man. An hour suffices to make known the villain.

\par \textbf{JO. Hearken to me, and set your heart at rest On that you speak of, while I make you learn No mortal thing is touched by soothsaying. Of that I’ll give thee warrant brief and plain. Word came to Laius once, I will not say From Phoebus’ self, but from his ministers, The King should be destroyed by his own son, [page 105][714-746] If son were born to him from me. What followed? Laius was slain, by robbers from abroad, Saith Rumour, in a cross-way! But the child Lived not three days, ere by my husband’s hand His feet were locked, and he was cast and left By messengers on the waste mountain wold. So Phoebus neither brought upon the boy His father’s murder, nor on Laius The thing he greatly feared, death by his son. Such issue came of prophesying words. Therefore regard them not. God can himself With ease bring forth what for his ends he needs.}

\par

\par 

\par \textbf{JO. Tall, with dark locks just sprinkled o’er with grey}
\par   In shape and bearing much resembling thee.

\par \textbf{OED. O heavy fate! How all unknowingly I laid that dreadful curse on my own head!}
\par 

\par \textbf{JO. How? I tremble as I gaze on thee, my king!}

\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Had he scant following, or, as princes use, Full numbers of a well-appointed train?}
\par 

\par \textbf{JO. There were but five in all}
\par   a herald one; And Laius travelled in the only car.

\par \textbf{OED. Woe! woe! ’Tis clear as daylight. Who was he That brought you this dire message, O my queen?}
\par 

\par \textbf{JO. A home-slave, who alone returned alive.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. And is he now at hand within the house?}
\par 

\par \textbf{JO. No, truly. When he came from yonder scene And found thee king in room of Laius murdered, He touched my hand, and made his instant prayer That I would send him to o’erlook the flocks And rural pastures, so to live as far As might be from the very thought of Thebes. I granted his desire. No servant ever More richly merited such boon than he.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Can he be brought again immediately?}
\par 

\par \textbf{JO. Indeed he can. But why desire it so?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Words have by me been uttered, O my queen, That give me too much cause to wish him here.}
\par 

\par \textbf{JO. Then come he shall. But I may surely claim To hear what in thy state goes heavily.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Thou shalt not lose thy rights in such an hour, When I am harrowed thus with doubt and fear. To whom more worthy should I tell my grief? —My father was Corinthian Polybus, My mother, Dorian Meropè.—I lived A prince among that people, till a chance Encountered me, worth wonder, but, though strange, Not worth the anxious thought it waked in me. For at a feasting once over the wine One deep in liquor called aloud to me, ‘Hail, thou false foundling of a foster-sire!’ That day with pain I held my passion down; But early on the morrow I came near And questioned both my parents, who were fierce [page 107][784-820] In anger at the man who broached this word. For their part I was satisfied, but still It galled me, for the rumour would not die. Eluding then my parents I made way To Delphi, where, as touching my desire, Phoebus denied me; but brake forth instead With other oracles of misery And horrible misfortune, how that I Must know my mother’s shame, and cause to appear A birth intolerable in human view, And do to death the author of my life. I fled forth at the word, conjecturing now Corinthia’s region by the stars of heaven, And wandered, where I never might behold Those dreadful prophecies fulfilled on me. So travelling on, I came even to the place Where, as thou tell’st, the King of Thebè fell. And, O my wife, I will hide nought from thee. When I drew near the cross-road of your tale, A herald, and a man upon a car, Like your description, there encountered me. And he who led the car, and he himself The greybeard, sought to thrust me from the path. Then in mine angry mood I sharply struck The driver-man who turned me from the way; Which when the elder saw, he watched for me As I passed by, and from the chariot-seat Smote full upon my head with the fork’d goad; But got more than he gave; for, by a blow From this right hand, smit with my staff, he fell Instantly rolled out of the car supine. I slew them every one. Now if that stranger Had aught in common with king Laius, What wretch on earth was e’er so lost as I? Whom have the Heavens so followed with their hate? No house of Theban or of foreigner Must any more receive me, none henceforth Must speak to me, but drive me from the door! I, I have laid this curse on mine own head! [page 108][821-858] Yea, and this arm that slew him now enfolds His queen. O cruel stain! Am I not vile? Polluted utterly! Yes, I must flee, And, lost to Thebè, nevermore behold My home, nor tread my country, lest I meet In marriage mine own mother, and bring low His head that gave me life and reared my youth, My father, Polybus. Ah! right were he Who should declare some god of cruel mood Had sent this trouble upon my soul! Ye Powers, Worshipped in holiness, ne’er may I see That day, but perish from the sight of men, Ere sins like these be branded on my name!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Thy fear is ours, O king}
\par   yet lose not hope, Till thou hast heard the witness of the deed.

\par \textbf{OED. Ay, that is all I still have left of hope, To bide the coming of the shepherd man.}
\par 

\par \textbf{JO. What eager thought attends his presence here?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. I’ll tell thee. Should his speech accord with thine, My life stands clear from this calamity.}
\par 

\par \textbf{JO. What word of mine agreed not with the scene?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. You said he spake of robbers in a band As having slain him. Now if he shall still Persist in the same number, I am free. One man and many cannot be the same. But should he tell of one lone traveller, Then, unavoidably, this falls on me.}
\par 

\par \textbf{JO. So ’twas given out by him, be sure of that. He cannot take it back. Not I alone But all the people heard him speak it so. And should he swerve in aught from his first tale, He ne’er can show the murder of the king Rightly accordant with the oracle. For Phoebus said expressly he should fall Through him whom I brought forth. But that poor babe Ne’er slew his sire, but perished long before. Wherefore henceforth I will pursue my way Regardless of all words of prophecy.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 109][859-894] OED. Wisely resolved. But still send one to bring The labourer swain, and be not slack in this.}

\par \textbf{MESS. O ye who in this land have ever held Chief honour, what an object of dire woe Awaits your eyes, your ears! What piercing grief Your hearts must suffer, if as kinsmen should Ye still regard the house of Laius! Not Phasis, nor the Danube’s rolling flood, Can ever wash away the stain and purge This mansion of the horror that it hides. —And more it soon shall give to light, not now Unconsciously enacted. Of all ill, Self-chosen sorrows are the worst to bear.}

\par \textbf{CH. The hapless queen! What was the fatal cause?}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Her own determination. You are spared The worst affliction, not being there to see. Yet to the height of my poor memory’s power The wretched lady’s passion you shall hear. When she had passed in her hot mood within The vestibule, straight to the bridal room She rushes, tearing with both hands her hair. Then having entered, shutting fast the door, She called aloud on Laius, long dead, With anguished memory of that birth of old Whereby the father fell, leaving his queen To breed a dreadful brood for his own son. And loudly o’er the bed she wailed, where she, In twofold wedlock, hapless, had brought forth Husband from husband, children from a child. We could not know the moment of her death, Which followed soon, for Oedipus with cries Broke in, and would not let us see her end, [page 121][1254-1290] But held our eyes as he careered the hall, Demanding arms, and where to find his wife,— No, not his wife, but fatal mother-croft, Cropped doubly with himself and his own seed. And in his rage some god directed him To find her}
\par  —’twas no man of us at hand. Then with a fearful shout, as following His leader, he assailed the folding-doors; And battering inward from the mortised bolts The bending boards, he burst into the room:  Where high suspended we beheld the queen, In twisted cordage resolutely swung. He all at once on seeing her, wretched king! Undid the pendent noose, and on the ground Lay the ill-starred queen. Oh, then ’twas terrible To see what followed—for he tore away The tiring-pins wherewith she was arrayed, And, lifting, smote his eyeballs to the root, Saying, Nevermore should they behold the evil His life inherited from that past time, But all in dark henceforth should look upon Features far better not beheld, and fail To recognize the souls he had longed to know. Thus crying aloud, not once but oftentimes He drave the points into his eyes; and soon The bleeding pupils moistened all his beard, Nor stinted the dark flood, but all at once The ruddy hail poured down in plenteous shower. Thus from two springs, from man and wife together, Rose the joint evil that is now o’erflowing. And the old happiness in that past day Was truly happy, but the present hour Hath pain, crime, ruin: —whatsoe’er of ill Mankind have named, not one is absent here.

The son of Agamemnon now returns, being of a full age, accompanied by this same attendant and his friend Pylades, with whom he has already concerted a plan for taking vengeance on his father’s murderers, in obedience to the command of Apollo.

\par \textbf{OLD MAN. Son of the king who led the Achaean host Erewhile beleaguering Troy, ’tis thine to day To see around thee what through many a year Thy forward spirit hath sighed for. Argolis Lies here before us, hallowed as the scene Of Io’s wildering pain}
\par   yonder, the mart Named from the wolf slaying God, and there, to our left, Hera’s famed temple. For we reach the bourn Of far renowned Mycenae, rich in gold And Pelops’ fatal roofs before us rise, Haunted with many horrors, whence my hand, Thy murdered sire then lying in his gore, Received thee from thy sister, and removed Where I have kept thee safe and nourished thee To this bright manhood thou dost bear, to be The avenger of thy father’s bloody death. Wherefore, Orestes, and thou, Pylades, Dearest of friends, though from a foreign soil, Prepare your enterprise with speed. Dark night Is vanished with her stars, and day’s bright orb Hath waked the birds of morn into full song. Now, then, ere foot of man go forth, ye two Knit counsels. ’Tis no time for shy delay:  The very moment for your act is come.

\par \textbf{OR. Kind faithful friend, how well thou mak’st appear Thy constancy in service to our house! As some good steed, aged, but nobly bred, Slacks not his spirit in the day of war, But points his ears to the fray, even so dost thou Press on and urge thy master in the van. Hear, then, our purpose, and if aught thy mind, [page 132][30-71] Keenly attent, discerns of weak or crude In this I now set forth, admonish me. I, when I visited the Pythian shrine Oracular, that I might learn whereby To punish home the murderers of my sire, Had word from Phoebus which you straight shall hear}
\par   ‘No shielded host, but thine own craft, O King! The righteous death-blow to thine arm shall bring.’ Then, since the will of Heaven is so revealed, Go thou within, when Opportunity Shall marshal thee the way, and gathering all Their business, bring us certain cognizance. Age and long absence are a safe disguise; They never will suspect thee who thou art. And let thy tale be that another land, Phocis, hath sent thee forth, and Phanoteus, Than whom they have no mightier help in war. Then, prefaced with an oath, declare thy news, Orestes’ death by dire mischance, down-rolled From wheel-borne chariot in the Pythian course. So let the fable be devised; while we, As Phoebus ordered, with luxuriant locks Shorn from our brows, and fair libations, crown My father’s sepulchre, and thence return Bearing aloft the shapely vase of bronze That’s hidden hard by in brushwood, as thou knowest, And bring them welcome tidings, that my form Is fallen ere now to ashes in the fire. How should this pain me, in pretence being dead, Really to save myself and win renown? No saying bodes men ill, that brings them gain. Oft have I known the wise, dying in word, Return with glorious salutation home. So lightened by this rumour shall mine eye Blaze yet like bale-star on mine enemies. O native earth! and Gods that hold the land, Accept me here, and prosper this my way! Thou, too, paternal hearth! To thee I come, Justly to cleanse thee by behest from heaven. Send me not bootless, Gods, but let me found [page 133][72-101] A wealthy line of fair posterity! I have spoken. To thy charge! and with good heed Perform it. We go forth.

\par  MONODY.

\par \textbf{EL. O purest light! And air by earth alone Measured and limitable, how oft have ye Heard many a piercing moan, Many a blow full on my bleeding breast, When gloomy night Hath slackened pace and yielded to the day! And through the hours of rest, Ah! well ’tis known To my sad pillow in yon house of woe, What vigil of scant joyance keeping, Whiles all within are sleeping, For my dear father without stint I groan, Whom not in bloody fray The War-god in the stranger-land Received with hospitable hand, But she that is my mother, and her groom, As woodmen fell the oak, Cleft through the skull with murdering stroke. And o’er this gloom No ray of pity, save from only me, Goes forth on thee, [page 134][101-136] My father, who didst die A cruel death of piteous agony. But ne’er will I Cease from my crying and sad mourning lay, While I behold the sky, Glancing with myriad fires, or this fair day. But, like some brood-bereavèd nightingale, With far-heard wail, Here at my father’s door my voice shall sound. O home beneath the ground! Hades unseen, and dread Persephonè, And darkling Hermes, and the Curse revered, And ye, Erinyës, of mortals feared, Daughters of Heaven, that ever see Who die unjustly, who are wronged i’ the bed Of those they wed, Avenge our father’s murder on his foe! Aid us, and send my brother to my side; Alone I cannot longer bide The oppressive strain of strength-o’ermastering woe.}
\par 

\par  CHORUS (entering).

\par \textbf{O sad Electra, childI 1 Of a lost mother, why still flow Unceasingly with lamentation wild For him who through her treachery beguiled, Inveigled by a wife’s deceit, Fallen at the foul adulterer’s feet, Most impiously was quelled long years ago? Perish the cause! if I may lawfully pray so.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. O daughters of a noble line, Ye come to soothe me from my troublous woe. I see, I know}
\par   Your love is not unrecognized of mine. But yet I will not seem as I forgot, Or cease to mourn my hapless father’s lot. Oh, of all love That ever may you move, This only boon I crave— Leave me to rave!

\par \textbf{[page 135] CH. Lament, nor praying breathI 2 [137-172] Will raise thy sire, our honoured chief, From that dim multitudinous gulf of death. Beyond the mark, due grief that measureth, Still pining with excess of pain Thou urgest lamentation vain, That from thy woes can bring thee no relief. Why hast thou set thy heart on unavailing grief?}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Senseless were he who lost from thought A noble father, lamentably slain! I love thy strain, Bewildered mourner, bird divinely taught, For ‘Itys,’ ‘Itys,’ ever heard to pine. O Niobè, I hold thee all divine, Of sorrows queen, Who with all tearful mien Insepulchred in stone Aye makest moan.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Not unto thee alone hath sorrow come,II 1 Daughter, that thou shouldst carry grief so far Beyond those dwellers in the palace-home Who of thy kindred are And own one source with thee. What life hath she, Chrysothemis, and Iphianassa bright, And he whose light Is hidden afar from taste of horrid doom, Youthful Orestes, who shall come To fair Mycenae’s glorious town, Welcomed as worthy of his sire’s renown, Sped by great Zeus with kindly thought, And to this land with happiest omen brought?}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Awaiting him I endlessly endure; Unwed and childless still I go, With tears in constant flow, Girt round with misery that finds no cure. But he forgets his wrong and all my teaching. What message have I sent beseeching, But baffled flies back idly home? Ever he longs, he saith, but, longing, will not come.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 136] CH. Take heart, dear child! still mighty in the skyII 2 [173-208] Is Zeus who ruleth all things and surveys. Commit to him thy grief that surgeth high, And walk in safer ways, Let not hate vex thee sore, Nor yet ignore The cause of hate and sorrow in thy breast. Time bringeth rest}
\par   All is made easy through his power divine. The heir of Agamemnon’s line Who dwells by Crisa’s pastoral strand Shall yet return unto his native land; And he shall yet regard his own Who reigns beneath upon his Stygian throne.

\par \textbf{EL. Meanwhile my life falls from me in despair Years pass and patience nought avails}
\par   My heart within me fails:  Orphaned I pine without protecting care; And like a sojourner all unregarded At slave-like labour unrewarded I toil within my father’s hall Thus meanly attired, and starved, a table-serving thrall.

\par \textbf{CH. Sad was thy greeting when he reached the strand,III 1 Piteous thy crying where thy father lay On that fell day When the bronze edge with dire effect was driven. By craft ’twas planned, By frenzied lust the blow was given}
\par   Mother and father of a monstrous birth, Whether a God there wrought or mortal of the Earth.

\par \textbf{EL. O day beyond all days that yet have rolled Most hateful in thy course of light! O horror of that night! O hideous feast, abhorr’d, not to be told! How could I bear it, when my father’s eye Saw death advancing from the ruthless pair, Conjoint in cruel villany, By whom my life was plunged in black despair? [page 137][209-243] Oh, to the workers of such deeds as these May great Olympus’ Lord Return of evil still afford, Nor let them wear the gloss of sovran ease!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Take thought to keep thy crying within bound.III 2 Doth not thy sense enlighten thee to see How recklessly Even now thou winnest undeservèd woe? Still art thou found To make thy misery overflow Through self-bred gloomy strife. But not for long Shall one alone prevail who strives against the strong.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. ’Twas dire oppression taught me my complaint I know my rage a quenchless fire}
\par   But nought, however dire, Shall visit this my frenzy with restraint, Or check my lamentation while I live. Dear friends, kind women of true Argive breed, Say, who can timely counsel give Or word of comfort suited to my need? Beyond all cure shall this my cause be known. No counsels more! Ah leave, Vain comforters, and let me grieve With ceaseless pain, unmeasured in my moan.

\par \textbf{CH. With kind intentIV Full tenderly my words are meant; Like a true mother pressing heart to heart, I pray thee, do not aggravate thy smart.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. But have my miseries a measure? Tell. Can it be well To pour forgetfulness upon the dead? Hath mortal head Conceived a wickedness so bold? O never may such brightness shine for me, Nor let me peaceful be With aught of good my life may still enfold, If from wide echoing of my father’s name The wings of keen lament I must withhold. [page 138][244-287] Sure holy shame And pious care would vanish among men, If he, mere earth and nothingness, must lie In darkness, and his foes shall not again Render him blood for blood in amplest penalty.}
\par 

\par \textbf{LEADER OF CH. Less from our own desires, my child, we came, Than for thy sake. But, if we speak amiss, Take thine own course. We still will side with thee.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Full well I feel that too impatiently I seem to multiply the sounds of woe. Yet suffer me, dear women! Mighty force Compels me. Who that had a noble heart And saw her father’s cause, as I have done, By day and night more outraged, could refrain? Are my woes lessening? Are they not in bloom?— My mother full of hate and hateful proved, Whilst I in my own home must dwell with these, My father’s murderers, and by them be ruled, Dependent on their bounty even for bread. And then what days suppose you I must pass, When I behold Aegisthus on the throne That was my father’s; when I see him wear Such robes, and pour libations by the hearth Where he destroyed him; lastly, when I see Their crowning insolence,—our regicide Laid in my father’s chamber beside her, My mother—if she still must bear the name When resting in those arms? Her shame is dead. She harbours with blood-guiltiness, and fears No vengeance, but, as laughing at the wrong, She watches for the hour wherein with guile She killed our sire, and orders dance and mirth That day o’ the month, and joyful sacrifice Of thanksgiving. But I within the house Beholding, weep and pine, and mourn that feast Of infamy, called by my father’s name, All to myself; for not even grief may flow As largely as my spirit would desire. That so-called princess of a noble race [page 139][288-327] O’ercrows my wailing with loud obloquy}
\par   ‘Hilding! are you alone in grief? Are none Mourning for loss of fathers but yourself? ‘Fore the blest Gods! ill may you thrive, and ne’er Find cure of sorrow from the powers below!’ So she insults:  unless she hear one say ‘Orestes will arrive’:  then standing close, She shouts like one possessed into mine ear, ‘These are your doings, this your work, I trow. You stole Orestes from my gripe, and placed His life with fosterers; but you shall pay Full penalty.’ So harsh is her exclaim. And he at hand, the husband she extols, Hounds on the cry, that prince of cowardice, From head to foot one mass of pestilent harm. Tongue-doughty champion of this women’s-war. I, for Orestes ever languishing To end this, am undone. For evermore Intending, still delaying, he wears out All hope, both here and yonder. How, then, friends, Can I be moderate, or feel the touch Of holy resignation? Evil fruit Cannot but follow on a life of ill.

\par \textbf{CH. Say, is Aegisthus near while thus you speak? Or hath he left the palace? We would know.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Most surely. Never think, if he were by, I could stray out of door. He is abroad.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Then with less fear I may converse with thee.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Ask what you will, for he is nowhere near.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. First of thy brother I beseech thee tell, How deem’st thou? Will he come, or still delay?}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. His promise comes, but still performance sleeps.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Well may he pause who plans a dreadful deed.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. I paused not in his rescue from the sword.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Fear not. He will bestead you. He is true.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. But for that faith my life had soon gone by.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. No more! I see approaching from the house Thy sister by both parents of thy blood, Chrysothemis; in her hand an offering, Such as old custom yields to those below.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 140][328-363]}
\par 

\par  Enter CHRYSOTHEMIS.

\par \textbf{CHRYSOTHEMIS. What converse keeps thee now beyond the gates, Dear sister? why this talk in the open day? Wilt thou not learn after so long to cease From vain indulgence of a bootless rage? I know in my own breast that I am pained By what thou griev’st at, and if I had power, My censure of their deeds would soon be known. But in misfortune I have chosen to sail With lowered canvas, rather than provoke With puny strokes invulnerable foes. I would thou didst the like}
\par   though I must own The right is on thy side, and not on mine. But if I mean to dwell at liberty, I must obey in all the stronger will.

\par \textbf{EL. ’Tis strange and pitiful, thy father’s child Can leave him in oblivion and subserve The mother. All thy schooling of me springs From her suggestion, not of thine own wit. Sure, either thou art senseless, or thy sense Deserts thy friends. Treason or dulness then? Choose!—You declared but now, if you had strength, You would display your hatred of this pair. Yet, when I plan full vengeance for my sire, You aid me not, but turn me from the attempt. What’s this but adding cowardice to evil? For tell me, or be patient till I show, What should I gain by ceasing this my moan? I live to vex them}
\par  —though my life be poor, Yet that suffices, for I honour him, My father,—if affection touch the dead. You say you hate them, but belie your word, Consorting with our father’s murderers. I then, were all the gifts in which you glory Laid at my feet, will never more obey This tyrant power. I leave you your rich board And life of luxury. Ne’er be it mine to feed On dainties that would poison my heart’s peace! [page 141][364-402] I care not for such honour as thou hast. Nor wouldst thou care if thou wert wise. But now, Having the noblest of all men for sire, Be called thy mother’s offspring; so shall most Discern thine infamy and traitorous mind To thy dead father and thy dearest kin.

\par \textbf{CH. No anger, we entreat. Both have said well, If each would learn of other, and so do.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. For my part, women, use hath seasoned me To her discourse. Nor had I spoken of this, Had I not heard a horror coming on That will restrain her from her endless moan.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Come speak it forth, this terror! I will yield, If thou canst tell me worse than I endure.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. I’ll tell thee all I know. If thou persist In these thy wailings, they will send thee far From thine own land, and close thee from the day, Where in a rock-hewn chamber thou may’st chant Thine evil orisons in darkness drear. Think of it, while there ’s leisure to reflect; Or if thou suffer, henceforth blame me not.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. And have they so determined on my life?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. ’Tis certain; when Aegisthus comes again.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. If that be all, let him return with speed!}

\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Sent by my mother to my father’s tomb To pour libations to him.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. How? To him? Most hostile to her of all souls that are?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Who perished by her hand—so thou wouldst say.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. What friend hath moved her? Who hath cared for this?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Methinks ’twas some dread vision, seen by night.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Gods of my father, O be with me now!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. What? art thou hopeful from the fear I spake of?}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Tell me the dream, and I will answer thee.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. I know but little of it.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Speak but that. A little word hath ofttimes been the cause Of ruin or salvation unto men.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. ’Tis said she saw our father’s spirit come Once more to visit the abodes of light; Then take and firmly plant upon the hearth The sceptre which he bore of old, and now Aegisthus bears}
\par   and out of this upsprang A burgeoned shoot, that shadowed all the ground Of loved Mycenae. So I heard the tale Told by a maid who listened when the Queen Made known her vision to the God of Day. But more than this I know not, save that I Am sent by her through terror of the dream. And I beseech thee by the Gods we serve To take my counsel and not rashly fall. If thou repel me now, the time may come When suffering shall have brought thee to my side.

\par \textbf{EL. Now, dear Chrysothemis, of what thou bearest Let nothing touch his tomb. ’Tis impious [page 143][433-469] And criminal to offer to thy sire Rites and libations from a hateful wife. Then cast them to the winds, or deep in dust Conceal them, where no particle may reach His resting-place}
\par   but lie in store for her When she goes underground. Sure, were she not Most hardened of all women that have been, She ne’er had sent those loveless offerings To grace the sepulchre of him she slew. For think how likely is the buried king To take such present kindly from her hand, Who slew him like an alien enemy, Dishonoured even in death, and mangled him, And wiped the death-stain with his flowing locks— Sinful purgation! Think you that you bear In those cold gifts atonement for her guilt? It is not possible. Wherefore let be. But take a ringlet from thy comely head, And this from mine, that lingers on my brow Longing to shade his tomb. Ah, give it to him, All I can give, and this my maiden-zone, Not daintily adorned, as once erewhile. Then, humbly kneeling, pray that from the ground He would arise to help us ’gainst his foes, And grant his son Orestes with high hand Strongly to trample on his enemies; That in our time to come from ampler stores We may endow him, than are ours to-day. I cannot but imagine that his will Hath part in visiting her sleep with fears. But howsoe’er, I pray thee, sister mine, Do me this service, and thyself, and him, Dearest of all the world to me and thee, The father of us both, who rests below.

\par \textbf{CH. She counsels piously; and thou, dear maid, If thou art wise, wilt do her bidding here.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Yea, when a thing is right, it is not well Idly to wrangle, but to act with speed. Only, dear friends, in this mine enterprise, Let me have silence from your lips, I pray; [page 144][470-507] For should my mother know of it, sharp pain Will follow yet my bold adventurous feat.[Exit CHRYSOTHEMIS}

He doth not forget, The Achaean lord that gave thee being, nor yet The bronzen-griding axe, edged like a spear, Hungry and keen, though dark with stains of time, That in the hour of hideous crime Quelled him with cruel butchery}

\par  Enter CLYTEMNESTRA.

\par \textbf{CLYTEMNESTRA. Again you are let loose and range at will. Ay, for Aegisthus is not here, who barred Your rashness from defaming your own kin Beyond the gates. But now he’s gone from home, You heed not me}
\par   though you have noised abroad That I am bold in crime, and domineer Outrageously, oppressing thee and thine. I am no oppressor, but I speak thee ill, For thou art ever speaking ill of me— Still holding forth thy father’s death, that I Have done it. So I did:  I know it well:  That I deny not; for not I alone But Justice slew him; and if you had sense, To side with Justice ought to be your part. For who but he of all the Greeks, your sire, For whom you whine and cry, who else but he Took heart to sacrifice unto the Gods Thy sister?—having less of pain, I trow, In getting her, than I, that bore her, knew! Come, let me question thee! On whose behalf Slew he my child? Was ’t for the Argive host? What right had they to traffic in my flesh?— Menelaüs was his brother. Wilt thou say He slew my daughter for his brother’s sake? How then should he escape me? Had not he, Menelaüs, children twain, begotten of her Whom to reclaim that army sailed to Troy? Was Death then so enamoured of my seed, That he must feast thereon and let theirs live? Or was the God-abandoned father’s heart Tender toward them and cruel to my child? [page 146][546-581] Doth this not argue an insensate sire? I think so, though your wisdom may demur. And could my lost one speak, she would confirm it. For my part, I can dwell on what I have done Without regret. You, if you think me wrong, Bring reasons forth and blame me to my face!

\par \textbf{EL. Thou canst not say this time that I began And brought this on me by some taunting word. But, so you’d suffer me, I would declare The right both for my sister and my sire.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CLY. Thou hast my sufferance. Nor would hearing vex, If ever thus you tuned your speech to me.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Then I will speak. You say you slew him. Where Could there be found confession more depraved, Even though the cause were righteous? But I’ll prove No rightful vengeance drew thee to the deed, But the vile bands of him you dwell with now. Or ask the huntress Artemis, what sin She punished, when she tied up all the winds Round Aulis.—I will tell thee, for her voice Thou ne’er may’st hear! ’Tis rumoured that my sire, Sporting within the goddess’ holy ground, His foot disturbed a dappled hart, whose death Drew from his lips some rash and boastful word. Wherefore Latona’s daughter in fell wrath Stayed the army, that in quittance for the deer My sire should slay at the altar his own child. So came her sacrifice. The Achaean fleet Had else no hope of being launched to Troy Nor to their homes. Wherefore, with much constraint And painful urging of his backward will, Hardly he yielded;—not for his brother’s sake. But grant thy speech were sooth, and all were done In aid of Menelaüs; for this cause Hadst thou the right to slay him? What high law Ordaining? Look to it, in establishing Such precedent thou dost not lay in store Repentance for thyself. For if by right [page 147][581-620] One die for one, thou first wilt be destroyed If Justice find thee.—But again observe The hollowness of thy pretended plea. Tell me, I pray, what cause thou dost uphold In doing now the basest deed of all, Chambered with the blood-guilty, with whose aid Thou slewest our father in that day. For him You now bear children—ousting from their right The stainless offspring of a holy sire. How should this plead for pardon? Wilt thou say Thus thou dost ’venge thy daughter’s injury? O shameful plea? Where is the thought of honour, If foes are married for a daughter’s sake?— Enough. No words can move thee. Thy rash tongue With checkless clamour cries that we revile Our mother. Nay, no mother, but the chief Of tyrants to us! For my life is full Of weariness and misery from thee And from thy paramour. While he abroad, Orestes, our one brother, who escaped Hardly from thy attempt, unhappy boy! Wears out his life, victim of cross mischance. Oft hast thou taunted me with fostering him To be thy punisher. And this, be sure, Had I but strength, I had done. Now for this word, Proclaim me what thou wilt,—evil in soul, Or loud in cursing, or devoid of shame}
\par   For if I am infected with such guilt, Methinks my nature is not fallen from thine.

\par \textbf{CH. (looking at CLYTEMNESTRA). I see her fuming with fresh wrath}
\par   the thought Of justice enters not her bosom now.

\par \textbf{CLY. What thought of justice should be mine for her, Who at her age can so insult a mother? Will shame withhold her from the wildest deed?}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Not unashamed, assure thee, I stand here, Little as thou mayest deem it. Well I feel My acts untimely and my words unmeet. But your hostility and treatment force me [page 148][620-656] Against my disposition to this course. Harsh ways are taught by harshness.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CLY. Brazen thing! Too true it is that words and deeds of mine Are evermore informing thy harsh tongue.}

\par \textbf{EL. The shame is yours, because the deeds are yours. My words are but their issue and effect.}

\par \textbf{CLY. By sovereign Artemis, whom still I serve, You’ll rue this boldness when Aegisthus comes.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. See now, your anger bears you off, and ne’er Will let you listen, though you gave me leave.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CLY. Must I not even sacrifice in peace From your harsh clamour, when you’ve had your say?}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. I have done. I check thee not. Go, sacrifice! Accuse not me of hindering piety.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CLY. (to an attendant). Then lift for me those fruitful offerings, While to Apollo, before whom we stand, I raise my supplication for release From doubts and fears that shake my bosom now. And, O defender of our house! attend My secret utterance. No friendly ear Is that which hearkens for my voice. My thought Must not be blazoned with her standing by, Lest through her envious and wide-babbling tongue She fill the city full of wild surmise. List, then, as I shall speak}
\par   and grant the dreams Whose two-fold apparition I to-night Have seen, if good their bodement, be fulfilled:  If hostile, turn their influence on my foes. And yield not them their wish that would by guile Thrust me from this high fortune, but vouchsafe That ever thus exempt from harms I rule The Atridae’s home and kingdom, in full life, Partaking with the friends I live with now All fair prosperity, and with my children, Save those who hate and vex me bitterly. Lykeian Phoebus, favourably hear My prayer, and grant to all of us our need! [page 149][657-689] More is there, which, though I be silent here, A God should understand.

So, another day, when came At sunrise the swift race of charioteers, He entered there with many a rival car: — One from Achaia, one from Sparta, two Libyan commanders of the chariot-yoke; And he among them fifth, with steeds of price From Thessaly;—the sixth Aetolia sent With chestnut mares; the seventh a Magnete man; The eighth with milk-white colts from Oeta’s vale; The ninth from god-built Athens; and the tenth Boeotia gave to make the number full. Then stood they where the judges of the course Had posted them by lot, each with his team; And sprang forth at the brazen trumpet’s blare. Shouting together to their steeds, they shook The reins, and all the course was filled with noise Of rattling chariots, and the dust arose To heaven. Now all in a confusèd throng Spared not the goad, each eager to outgo The crowded axles and the snorting steeds; For close about his nimbly circling wheels And stooping sides fell flakes of panted foam. Orestes, ever nearest at the turn, With whirling axle seemed to graze the stone, And loosing with free rein the right-hand steed That pulled the side-rope, held the near one in. So for a time all chariots upright moved, But soon the Oetaean’s hard-mouthed horses broke From all control, and wheeling as they passed From the sixth circuit to begin the seventh, Smote front to front against the Barcan car. [page 151][728-766] And when that one disaster had befallen, Each dashed against his neighbour and was thrown, Till the whole plain was strewn with chariot-wreck. Then the Athenian, skilled to ply the rein, Drew on one side, and heaving to, let pass The rider-crested surge that rolled i’ the midst. Meanwhile Orestes, trusting to the end, Was driving hindmost with tight rein; but now, Seeing him left the sole competitor, Hurling fierce clamour through his steeds, pursued:  So drave they yoke by yoke—now this, now that Pulling ahead with car and team. Orestes, Ill-fated one, each previous course had driven Safely without a check, but after this, In letting loose again the left-hand rein, He struck the edge of the stone before he knew, Shattering the axle’s end, and tumbled prone, Caught in the reins, that dragged him with sharp thongs. Then as he fell to the earth the horses swerved, And roamed the field. The people when they saw Him fallen from out the car, lamented loud For the fair youth, who had achieved before them Such glorious feats, and now had found such woe,— Dashed on the ground, then tossed with legs aloft Against the sky,—until the charioteers, Hardly restraining the impetuous team, Released him, covered so with blood that none,— No friend who saw—had known his hapless form. Which then we duly burned upon the pyre. And straightway men appointed to the task From all the Phocians bear his mighty frame— Poor ashes! narrowed in a brazen urn,— That he may find in his own fatherland His share of sepulture.—Such our report, Painful to hear, but unto us, who saw, The mightiest horror that e’er met mine eye.

\par \textbf{CH. Alas! the stock of our old masters, then, Is utterly uprooted and destroyed.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CLY. O heavens! what shall I say? That this is well? [page 152][767-799] Or terrible, but gainful? Hard my lot, To save my life through my calamity!}
\par 

\par \textbf{OLD M. Lady, why hath my speech disheartened thee?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CLY. To be a mother hath a marvellous power}
\par   No injury can make one hate one’s child.

\par \textbf{OLD M. Then it should seem our coming was in vain.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CLY. In vain? Nay, verily; thou, that hast brought Clear evidences of his fate, who, sprung Prom my life’s essence, severed from my breast And nurture, was estranged in banishment, And never saw me from the day he went Out from this land, but for his father’s blood Threatened me still with accusation dire; That sleep nor soothed at night nor sweetly stole My senses from the day, but, all my time, Each instant led me on the way to death!— But this day’s chance hath freed me from all fear Of him, and of this maid}
\par   who being at home Troubled me more, and with unmeasured thirst Kept draining my life-blood; but now her threats Will leave us quiet days, methinks, and peace Unbroken.—How then shouldst thou come in vain?

\par \textbf{EL. O misery! ’Tis time to wail thy fate, Orestes, when, in thy calamity, Thy mother thus insults thee. Is it well?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CLY. ’Tis well that he is gone, not that you live.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Hear, ’venging spirits of the lately dead!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CLY. The avenging spirits have heard and answered well.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Insult us now, for thou art fortunate!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CLY. You and Orestes are to quench my pride.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Our pride is quenched. No hope of quenching thee!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CLY. A world of good is in thy coming, stranger, Since thou hast silenced this all-clamorous tongue.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OLD M. Then I may go my way, seeing all is well.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 153][800-836] CLY. Nay, go not yet! That would disgrace alike Me and the friend who sent you to our land. But come thou in, and leave her out of door To wail her own and loved ones’ overthrow. [Exeunt CLYTEMNESTRA and Old Man}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Think you the wretch in heartfelt agony Weeps inconsolably her perished son? She left us with a laugh! O misery! How thou hast ruined me, dear brother mine, By dying! Thou hast torn from out my heart The only hope I cherished yet, that thou Living wouldst come hereafter to avenge Thy father’s woes and mine. Where must I go? Since I am left of thee and of my sire Bereaved and lonely, and once more must be The drudge and menial of my bitterest foes, My father’s murderers. Say, is it well? Nay, nevermore will I consort with these, But sinking here before the palace gate, Thus, friendless, I will wither out my life. Hereat if any in the house be vexed, Let them destroy me; for to take my life Were kindness, and to live is only pain}

\par 

\par  Enter CHRYSOTHEMIS.

\par \textbf{CHR. Driven by delight, dear sister, I am come, Reckless of dignity, with headlong speed. For news I bear of joy and sweet relief From ills that drew from thee thy ceaseless moan.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Whence couldst thou hear of succour for my woes, That close in darkness without hope of dawn?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Here is Orestes, learn it from my mouth, As certainly as you now look on me.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. What? Art thou mad, unhappy one, to laugh Over thine own calamity and mine?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. No, by our father’s hearth, I say not this In mockery. I tell you he is come.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Me miserable! Who hath given thine ear The word that so hath wrought on thy belief?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Myself am the eyewitness, no one else Gained my belief, but proofs I clearly saw.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. What sign hath so engrossed thine eye, poor girl? What sight hath fired thee with this quenchless glow?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. But list to me, I pray thee, that henceforth Thou mayest account me clear eyed, or a fool!}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. By all means, if it pleasure thee, say on.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Well, I will tell thee all I saw}
\par  —I came Unto the ancient tomb that holds our sire; And from the topmost mound I marked a stream Of milk fresh-flowing, and his resting place Ringed round with garlands of all flowers that blow. I marvelled at the sight, and peered about, Lest some one might be nearer than we knew. But finding all was quiet in the spot, I ventured closer to the tomb, and there, Hard by the limit, I beheld a curl Of hair new shorn, with all the gloss of youth And straight it struck my heart, as with a sense Of something seen, ah me! long, long ago, And told me that my sight encountered here The token of Orestes, dearest soul Then, clasping it, I did not cry aloud, But straight mine eyes were filled with tears of joy. [page 156][907-943] And now as much as then I feel assured He and none else bestowed this ornament. To whom beyond thyself and me belongs Such consecration? And I know this well, I did it not,—nor thou. Impossible! Thou canst not worship even the blessèd Gods Forth of this roof, unpunished. And, most sure, Our mother is not minded so to act, Nor, had she done it, could we fail to know. This offering comes then of Orestes’ hand. Take courage, dear one. Not one fate pursues One house perpetually, but changeth still. Ours was a sullen Genius, but perchance This day begins the assurance of much good.

\par \textbf{EL. Oh how I pity thine infatuate mind!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Why? Dost thou find no comfort in my news?}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. You know not where you roam. Far wide! far wide!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Not know? when I have seen it with mine eyes?}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Dear, he is dead. Look not to him, poor girl! Salvation comes to thee no more from him.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Oh me, unfortunate! Who told thee this?}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. He who stood by and saw his life destroyed.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Amazement seizes me. Where is that man?}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Right welcome to the mother there within.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Me miserable! Who then can have decked With all those ceremonies our father’s tomb?}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. I cannot but suppose some hand hath brought These gifts in memory of Orestes dead.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. O cruel fate! While I in ecstasy Sped with such news, all ignorant, it seems, Of our dire fortune; and, arriving, find Fresh sorrows added to the former woe.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. It is so, sister; yet if thou wilt list To me, thou mayest disperse this heaviness.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. What? Shall I raise the dead again to life?}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. I did not mean so. I am not so fond.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. What bid you then that I have power to do?}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. To endure courageously what I enjoin.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 157][944-981] CHR. So it make profit, I will not refuse.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Remember, without toil no plan may thrive!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. I know it, and will aid thee to my power.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Then hearken my resolve. Thou seëst now, We have no friendly succour in the world; But death has taken all, and we are left Two only. I, so long as I could hear My brother lived and flourished, still had hope He would arise to wreak his father’s blood. But now that he is gone, to thee I turn, To help thy sister boldly to destroy The guilty author of our father’s death, Aegisthus.—Wherefore hide it from thee now? —Yea, sister! Till what term wilt thou remain Inactive? To what end? What hope is yet Left standing? Surely thou hast cause to grieve, Bobbed of thy father’s opulent heritage, And feeling bitterly the creeping years That find thee still a virgin and unwed. Nay, nor imagine thou shalt ever know That blessing. Not so careless of his life Is King Aegisthus, as to risk the birth Of sons from us, to his most certain fall. But if thou wilt but follow my resolve, First thou shalt win renown of piety From our dead father, and our brother too, Who rest beneath the ground, and shalt be free For evermore in station as in birth, And nobly matched in marriage, for the good Draw gazers to them still. Then seest thou not What meed of honour, if thou dost my will, Thou shalt apportion to thyself and me? For who, beholding us, what citizen, What foreigner, will not extend the hand Of admiration, and exclaim, ‘See, friends, These scions of one stock, these noble twain, These that have saved their father’s house from woe, Who once when foes were mighty, set their life Upon a cast, and stood forth to avenge The stain of blood! Who will not love the pair [page 158][981-1018] And do them reverence? Who will not give Honour at festivals, and in the throng Of popular resort, to these in chief, For their high courage and their bold emprise?’ Such fame will follow us in all the world. Living or dying, still to be renowned. Ah, then, comply, dear sister; give thy sire This toil—this labour to thy brother give; End these my sufferings, end thine own regret}
\par   The well-born cannot bear to live in shame.

\par \textbf{CH. In such affairs, for those who speak and hear Wise thoughtfulness is still the best ally.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. True, noble women, and before she spake Sound thought should have prevented the rash talk That now hath proved her reckless. What wild aim Beckons thee forth in arming this design Whereto thou wouldst demand my ministry? Dost not perceive, thou art not man but woman, Of strength inferior to thine enemies,— Their Genius daily prospering more and more, Whilst ours is dwindling into nothingness? Who then that plots against a life so strong Shall quit him of the danger without harm? Take heed we do not add to our distress Should some one hear of this our colloquy. Small help and poor advantage ’twere for us To win brief praise and then inglorious die. Nay, death is not so hateful as when one Desiring death is balked of that desire. And I beseech thee, ere in utter ruin We perish and make desolate our race, Refrain thy rage. And I will guard for thee In silence these thy words unrealized; If thou wilt learn this wisdom from long time, Having no strength, to bend before the strong.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Comply. Than prudence and a heedful mind, No fairer treasure can be found for men.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Thy words have not surprised me. Well I knew The good I offered would come back with scorn. [page 159][1019-1052] I, all alone and with a single hand, Must do this. For it shall not rest undone.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Would thou hadst been thus minded when our sire Lay dying! In one act thou hadst compassed all.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. My spirit was the same}
\par   my mind was less.

\par \textbf{CHR. Be such the life-long temper of thy mind!}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Thine admonition augurs little aid.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Yea. For the attempt would bring me certain bane.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. I envy thee thy prudence, hate thy fear.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Even when thou speak’st me fair, I will endure it.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Take heart. That never will be thine from me.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Long time remains to settle that account.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. I find no profit in thee. Go thy way.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Profit there is, hadst thou a mind to learn.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Go to thy mother and declare all this!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. I am not so in hatred of thy life.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Yet know the shame thou wouldst prepare for me.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. No, no! Not shame, but care for thine estate.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Must I still follow as thou thinkest good?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. When thou hast wisdom, thou shalt be the guide.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. ’Tis hard when error wears the garb of sense.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Right. That is the misfortune of your case.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Why? Feel you not the justice of my speech?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Justice may chance to bring me injury.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. I care not, I, to live by such a rule.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Well, if you do it, you will find me wise.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Well, I will do it, nought dismayed by thee.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Speak you plain sooth? and will you not be counselled?}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. No, for bad counsel is of all most hateful.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. You take the sense of nothing that I say.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Long since, not newly, my resolve is firm.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. Then I will go. Thy heart will ne’er be brought To praise my words, nor I thine action here.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Then go within! I will not follow thee, [page 160][1053-1089] Though thou desire it vehemently. None Would be so fond to hunt on a cold trail.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CHR. If this seem wisdom to thee, then be wise Thy way}
\par   but in the hour of misery, When it hath caught thee, thou wilt praise my words. [Exit CHRYSOTHEMIS

Then bright was thy departure, whom I now Bear lightly, a mere nothing, in my hands. Would I had gone from life, ere I dispatched Thee from my arms that saved thee to a land Of strangers, stealing thee from death! For then Thou hadst been quiet on that far off day, And had thy portion in our father’s tomb Now thou hast perished in the stranger land Far from thy sister, lorn and comfortless And I, O wretchedness! neither have bathed And laid thee forth, nor from the blazing fire Collected the sad burden, as was meet But thou, when foreign hands have tended thee Com’st a small handful in a narrow shell Woe for the constant care I spent on thee Of old all vainly, with sweet toil! For never Wast thou thy mother’s darling, nay, but mine, And I of all the household most thy nurse, While ‘sister, sister,’ was thy voice to me But now all this is vanished in one day, Dying in thy death. Thou hast carried all away As with a whirlwind, and art gone. No more My father lives, thyself art lost in death, I am dead, who lived in thee. Our enemies Laugh loudly, and she maddens in her joy, Our mother most unmotherly, of whom Thy secret missives ofttimes told me, thou Wouldst be the punisher. But that fair hope The hapless Genius of thy lot and mine Hath reft away, and gives thee thus to me,— For thy loved form thy dust and fruitless shade O bitterness! O piteous sight! Woe! woe! Oh! sent on thy dire journey, dearest one, [page 163][1164-1197] How thou hast ruined me! Thou hast indeed, Dear brother!

\par \textbf{EL. And where is his poor body’s resting-place?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. Nowhere. Seek not the living with the dead,}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. My son, what saidst thou?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. Nought but what is true.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Doth he yet live?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. If I have life in me.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Art thou Orestes?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. Let my signet here, That was our father’s, tell thine eyes, I am.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. O day of days!}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. Time hath no happier hour.}
\par

\par \textbf{OR. Hearken not otherwhere.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Have my arms caught thee?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. Hold me so for aye!}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. O dearest women, Argives of my home! Ye see Orestes, dead in craft, but now By that same craft delivered and preserved.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 165][1230-1270] CH. We see, dear daughter, and the gladsome tear Steals from our eye to greet the bright event.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Offspring of him I loved beyond all telling!I 1 Ah! thou art come,—hast found me, eye to eye Behold’st the face thou didst desire to see.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. True, I am here; but bide in silence still.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Wherefore?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. Hush! speak not loud, lest one within should hearken.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. By ever-virgin Artemis, ne’er will I Think worthy of my fear This useless mass of woman-cowardice Burdening the house within, Not peering out of door.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. Yet know that women too have might in war. Of that methinks thou hast feeling evidence.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Ah me! thou hast unveiled And thrust before my gaze That burning load of my distress No time will soothe, no remedy will heal.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. I know that too. But when we are face to face With the evildoers,—then let remembrance work.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. All times alike are fit with instant painI 2 Justly to mind me of that dreadful day; Even now but hardly hath my tongue been free.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. Yes, that is it. Therefore preserve this boon.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Whereby?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. Put limits to unseasonable talk.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Ah! brother, who, when thou art come, Could find it meet to exchange Language for silence, as thou bidst me do? Since beyond hope or thought Was this thy sight to me.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. God gave me to your sight when so he willed.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. O heaven of grace beyond The joy I knew but now! If God hath brought thee to our roof, A miracle of bounty then is here.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 166] []1271-1304 OR. I hate to curb the gladness of thy spirit, But yet I fear this ecstasy of joy.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Oh! after all these years,II Now thou at length hast sped Thy dearest advent on the wished-for way, Do not, in all this woe Thou seest surrounding me—}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. What means this prayer?}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Forbid me not my joy, Nor make me lose the brightness of thy face!}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. Deep were my wrath at him who should attempt it.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Is my prayer heard?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. Why doubt it?}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Friends, I learned A tale beyond my thought; and hearing I restrained My passion, voiceless in my misery, Uttering no cry. But now I have thee safe; now, dearest, thou art come, With thy blest countenance, which I Can ne’er forget, even at the worst of woe.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. A truce now to unnecessary words. My mother’s vileness and Aegisthus’ waste, Draining and squandering with spendthrift hand Our patrimony, tell me not anew. Such talk might stifle opportunity. But teach me, as befits the present need, What place may serve by lurking vigilance Or sudden apparition to o’erwhelm Our foes in the adventure of to-day. And, when we pass within, take heedful care Bright looks betray thee not unto our mother. But groan as for the dire calamity Vainly reported}
\par  —Let’s achieve success, Then with free hearts we may rejoice and laugh.

\par \textbf{EL. Dear brother, wheresoe’er thy pleasure leads, My will shall follow, since the joys I know, Not from myself I took them, but from thee. And ne’er would I consent thy slightest grief [page 167][1305-1342] Should win for me great gain. Ill should I then Serve the divinity of this high hour! Thou knowest how matters in the palace stand. Thou hast surely heard, Aegisthus is from home, And she, our mother, is within. Nor fear She should behold me with a smiling face. Mine ancient hate of her hath sunk too deep. And from the time I saw thee, tears of joy Will cease not. Wherefore should I stint their flow? I, who in this thy coming have beheld Thee dead and living? Strangely hast thou wrought On me;—that should my father come alive, I would not think the sight were miracle, But sober truth. Since such thy presence, then, Lead as thy spirit prompts. For I alone Of two things surely had achieved one, Noble deliverance or a noble death.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. Be silent; for I hear within the house A footstep coming forth.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. (loudly). Strangers, go in! For none within the palace will reject Your burden, nor be gladdened by the event.}
\par 

\par  Enter the Old Man.

\par \textbf{OLD M. O lost in folly and bereft of soul! Is’t that your care for life hath ebbed away, Or were you born without intelligence, When fallen, not near, but in the midst of ill, And that the greatest, ye perceive it not? Had I not watched the doors this while, your deeds Had gone within the palace ere yourselves. But, as things are, my care hath fenced you round. Now, then, have done with long-protracted talk, And this insatiable outburst of joy, And enter, for in such attempts as these Delay is harmful}
\par   and ’tis more than time.

\par \textbf{OR. But how shall I find matters there within?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OLD M. Well. You are shielded by their ignorance.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. That means you have delivered me as dead.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OLD M. Alone of dead men thou art here above.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 168][1343-1375] OR. Doth this delight them, or how went the talk?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OLD M. I will report, when all is done. Meanwhile, Know, all is well with them, even what is evil.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Who is this, brother? I beseech thee, tell.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. Dost not perceive?}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. I cannot even imagine.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. Know’st not into whose hands thou gav’st me once?}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Whose hands? How say you?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. His, who through thy care Conveyed me secretly to Phocis’ plain.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. What! is this he, whom I, of all the band, Found singly faithful in our father’s death?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. He is that man. No more!}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. O gladsome day! Dear only saviour of our father’s house, How earnest thou hither? Art thou he indeed, That didst preserve Orestes and myself From many sorrows? O dear hands, kind feet, Swift in our service,—how couldst thou so long Be near, nor show one gleam, but didst destroy My heart with words, hiding the loveliest deeds? Father!—in thee methinks I see my father. O welcome! thou of all the world to me Most hated and most loved in one short hour.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OLD M. Enough, dear maiden! Many nights and days Are circling hitherward, that shall reveal In clear recountment all that came between. But to you two that stand beside I tell, Now is your moment, with the Queen alone, And none of men within; but if you pause, Know that with others of profounder skill You’ll have to strive, more than your present foes.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OR. Then, Pylades, we need no more to dwell On words, but enter on this act with speed, First worshipping the holy shrines o’ the Gods That were my father’s, harboured at the gate. [They pass within. ELECTRA remains in an attitude of prayer}

\par \textbf{[page 169][1376-1406] EL. O King Apollo! hear them graciously, And hear me too, that with incessant hand Honoured thee richly from my former store!

\par \textbf{CH. Lo, where the War-god moves1 With soft, sure footstep, on to his design, Breathing hot slaughter of an evil feud! Even now the inevitable hounds that track Dark deeds of hideous crime Are gone beneath the covert of the domes. Not long in wavering suspense shall hang The dreaming presage of my wistful soul.}
\par 

\par \textbf{For lo! within is led2 With crafty tread the avenger of the shades, Even to his father’s throne of ancient power, And in his hand the bright new-sharpened death!

\par 

\par \textbf{EL. A cry within! Did ye not hear it, friends?}

\par \textbf{AEGISTHUS. Which of you know where are the Phocian men Who brought the news I hear, Orestes’ life Hath suffered shipwreck in a chariot-race? You, you I question, you in former time So fearless! You methinks most feelingly Can tell us, for it touches you most near.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. I know}

\par \textbf{OR. A prophet! How wert thou so long deceived?}
\par 

\par \textbf{AEG. Undone, undone! Yet let me speak one word.}
\par 

\par \textbf{EL. Brother, by Heaven, no more! Let him not speak. When death is certain, what do men in woe Gain from a little time? Kill him at once! And, killed, expose him to such burial From dogs and vultures, as beseemeth such, Far from our view. Nought less will solace me For the remembrance of a life of pain.}

\section{THE TRACHINIAN MAIDENS}\section{THE PERSONS} 
\par  [page 176] This tragedy is named from the Chorus. From the subject it might have been called ‘Deanira or the Death of Heracles’.

\par  The Centaur Nessus, in dying by the arrow of Heracles, which had been dipped in the venom of the Hydra, persuaded the bride Deanira, whose beauty was the cause of his death, to keep some of the blood from the wound as a love-charm for her husband. Many years afterwards, when Heracles was returning from his last exploit of sacking Oechalia, in Euboea, he sent before him, by his herald Lichas, Iole, the king’s daughter, whom he had espoused. Deanira, when she had discovered this, commissioned Lichas when he returned to present his master with a robe, which she had anointed with the charm,—hoping by this means to regain her lord’s affection. But the poison of the Hydra did its work, and Heracles died in agony, Deanira having already killed herself on ascertaining what she had done. The action takes place in Trachis, near the Mahae Gulf, where Heracles and Deanira, by permission of Ceyx, the king of the country, have been living in exile. At the close of the drama, Heracles, while yet alive, is carried towards his pyre on Mount Oeta.

\section{THE TRACHINIAN MAIDENS}
\par \textbf{DÊANIRA. Men say,—’twas old experience gave the word, —‘No lot of mortal, ere he die, can once Be known for good or evil.’ But I know, Before I come to the dark dwelling-place, Mine is a lot, adverse and hard and sore. Who yet at Pleuron, in my father’s home, Of all Aetolian women had most cause To fear my bridal. For a river-god, Swift Achelôüs, was my suitor there And sought me from my father in three forms; Now in his own bull-likeness, now a serpent Of coiling sheen, and now with manlike build But bovine front, while from the shadowy beard Sprang fountain-waters in perpetual spray. Looking for such a husband, I, poor girl! Still prayed that Death might find me, ere I knew That nuptial.—Later, to my glad relief, Zeus’ and Alcmena’s glorious offspring came, And closed with him in conflict, and released My heart from torment. How the fight was won I could not tell. If any were who saw Unshaken of dread foreboding, such may speak. But I sate quailing with an anguished fear, Lest beauty might procure me nought but pain, Till He that rules the issue of all strife, Gave fortunate end—if fortunate! For since, Assigned by that day’s conquest, I have known The couch of Heracles, my life is spent In one continual terror for his fate. Night brings him, and, ere morning, some fresh toil Drives him afar. And I have borne him seed; Which he, like some strange husbandman that farms [page 178] A distant field, finds but at sowing time And once in harvest. Such a weary life Still tossed him to and fro,—no sooner home But forth again, serving I know not whom. And when his glorious head had risen beyond These labours, came the strongest of my fear. For since he quelled the might of Iphitus, We here in Trachis dwell, far from our home, Dependent on a stranger, but where he Is gone, none knoweth. Only this I know, His going pierced my heart with pangs for him, And now I am all but sure he bears some woe. These fifteen months he hath sent me not one word. And I have cause for fear. Ere he set forth He left a scroll with me, whose dark intent I oft pray Heaven may bring no sorrow down.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ATTENDANT. Queen Dêanira, many a time ere now Have I beheld thee with all tearful moan Bewailing the departure of thy lord. But, if it be permitted that a slave Should tender counsel to the free, my voice May venture this}
\par  —Of thy strong band of sons Why is not one commissioned to explore For Heracles? and why not Hyllus first, Whom most it would beseem to show regard For tidings of his father’s happiness? Ah! here I see him bounding home, with feet Apt for employment! If you count me wise, He and my words attend upon your will.

\par  Enter HYLLUS.

\par \textbf{DÊ. Dear child, dear boy! even from the lowliest head Wise counsel may come forth. This woman here, Though a bond-maiden, hath a free-born tongue.}
\par 

\par \textbf{HYL. What word is spoken, mother? May I know?}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. That, with thy father lost to us so long, ’Tis shame thou dost not learn his dwelling-place.}
\par 

\par \textbf{HYL. Yea, I have learnt, if one may trust report.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Where art thou told his seat is fixed, my son?}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 179] HYL. ’Tis said that through the length of this past year He wrought as bondman to a Lydian girl.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Hath he borne that? Then nothing can be strange!}
\par 

\par \textbf{HYL. Well, that is over, I am told. He is free.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Where is he rumoured, then, alive or dead?}
\par 

\par \textbf{HYL. In rich Euboea, besieging, as they tell, The town of Eurytus, or offering siege.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Child, hast thou heard what holy oracles He left with me, touching that very land?}
\par 

\par \textbf{HYL. What were they, mother, for I never knew?}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. That either he must end his being there, Or, this one feat performed, his following time Should grace his life with fair prosperity. Wilt thou not then, my child, when he is held In such a crisis of uncertain peril, Run to his aid?—since we must perish with him, Or owe our lasting safety to his life.}
\par 

\par \textbf{HYL. I will go, mother. Had I heard this voice Of prophecy, long since I had been there. Fear is unwonted for our father’s lot. But now I know, my strength shall all be spent To learn the course of these affairs in full.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Go then, my son. Though late, to learn and do What wisdom bids, hath certainty of gain. [Exit HYLLUS. DÊANIRA withdraws}
\par 

\par  CHORUS (entering and turning towards the East).

\par \textbf{Born of the starry night in her undoing,I 1 Lulled in her bosom at thy parting glow, O Sun! I bid thee show, What journey is Alcmena’s child pursuing? What region holds him now, ’Mong winding channels of the deep, Or Asian plains, or rugged Western steep? Declare it, thou Peerless in vision of thy flashing ray That lightens on the world with each new day.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 180] Sad Dêanira, bride of battle-wooing,I 2 [104-143] Ne’er lets her tearful eyelids close in rest, But in love-longing breast, Like some lorn bird its desolation rueing, Of her great husband’s way Still mindful, worn with harrowing fear Lest some new danger for him should be near, By night and day Pines on her widowed couch of ceaseless thought, With dread of evil destiny distraught}
\par  [Enter DÊANIRA.

\par \textbf{For many as are billows of the SouthII 1 Blowing unweariedly, or Northern gale, One going and another coming on Incessantly, baffling the gazer’s eye, Such Cretan ocean of unending toil Cradles our Cadmus-born, and swells his fame. But still some power doth his foot recall From stumbling down to Hades’ darkling hall.}
\par 

\par \textbf{Wherefore, in censure of thy mood, I bringII 2 Glad, though opposing, counsel. Let not hope Grow weary. Never hath a painless life Been cast on mortals by the power supreme Of the All-disposer, Cronos’ son. But joy And sorrow visit in perpetual round All mortals, even as circleth still on high The constellation of the Northern sky.}
\par 

\par \textbf{What lasteth in the world? Not starry night,III Nor wealth, nor tribulation; but is gone All suddenly, while to another soul The joy or the privation passeth on. These hopes I bid thee also, O my Queen! Hold fast continually, for who hath seen Zeus so forgetful of his own? How can his providence forsake his son?}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. I see you have been told of my distress, And that hath brought you. But my inward woe, Be it evermore unknown to you, as now! [page 181][144-179] Such the fair garden of untrammeled ease Where the young life grows safely. No fierce heat, No rain, no wind disturbs it, but unharmed It rises amid airs of peace and joy, Till maiden turn to matron, and the night Inherit her dark share of anxious thought, Haunted with fears for husband or for child. Then, imaged through her own calamity, Some one may guess the burden of my life. Full many have been the sorrows I have wept, But one above the rest I tell to-day. When my great husband parted last from home, He left within the house an ancient scroll Inscribed with characters of mystic note, Which Heracles had never heretofore, In former labours, cared to let me see,— As bound for bright achievement, not for death. But now, as though his life had end, he told What marriage-portion I must keep, what shares He left his sons out of their father’s ground}
\par   And set a time, when fifteen moons were spent, Counted from his departure, that even then Or he must die, or if that date were out And he had run beyond it, he should live Thenceforth a painless and untroubled life. Such by Heaven’s fiat was the promised end Of Heracles’ long labours, as he said; So once the ancient oak-tree had proclaimed In high Dodona through the sacred Doves. Of which prediction on this present hour In destined order of accomplishment The veritable issue doth depend. And I, dear friends, while taking rest, will oft Start from sweet slumbers with a sudden fear, Scared by the thought, my life may be bereft Of the best husband in the world of men.

\par \textbf{CH. Hush! For I see approaching one in haste, Garlanded, as if laden with good news.}

\par \textbf{DÊ. O Zeus! who rulest Oeta’s virgin wold, At last, though late, thou hast vouchsafed us joy. Lift up your voices, O my women! ye Within the halls, and ye beyond the gate! For now we reap the gladness of a ray, That dawns unhoped for in this rumour’s sound.}

\par  CHORUS

\par \textbf{With a shout by the hearth let the palace roof ring From those that are dreaming of bridal, and ye, Young men, let your voices in harmony sing To the God of the quiver, the Lord of the free!

\par \textbf{LICHAS. A happy welcome on a happy way, As prosperous our achievement. Meet it is Good words should greet bright actions, mistress mine!}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Kind friend, first tell me what I first would know— Shall I receive my Heracles alive?}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. I left him certainly alive and strong}
\par   Blooming in health, not with disease oppressed.

\par \textbf{DÊ. In Greece, or in some barbarous country? Tell!}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. Euboea’s island hath a promontory, Where to Cenaean Zeus he consecrates Rich altars and the tribute of the ground.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Moved by an oracle, or from some vow?}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. So vowed he when he conquered with the spear The country of these women whom you see.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. And who, by Heaven, are they? Who was their sire? Their case is piteous, or eludes my thought.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 184][244-280] LICH. He took them for the service of the Gods And his own house, when high Oechalia fell.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Was’t then before that city he was kept Those endless ages of uncounted time?}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. Not so. The greater while he was detained Among the Lydians, sold, as he declares, To bondage. Nor be jealous of the word, Since Heaven, my Queen, was author of the deed. Enthrallèd so to Asian Omphalè, He, as himself avers, fulfilled his year. The felt reproach whereof so chafed his soul, He bound fierce curses on himself and sware That,—children, wife and all,—he yet would bring In captive chains the mover of this harm. Nor did this perish like an idle word, But, when the stain was off him, straight he drew Allied battalions to assault the town Of Eurytus, whom, sole of earthly powers, He had noted as the source of his annoy, Because, having received him in his hall A guest of ancient days, he burst on him With outrage of loud voice and villanous mind, Saying, ‘with his hand upon the unerring bow, Oechalia’s princes could o’ershoot his skill; And born to bondage, he must quail beneath His overlord’; lastly, to crown this cry, When at a banquet he was filled with wine, He flung him out of door. Whereat being wroth, When Iphitus to the Tirynthian height Followed the track where his brood-mares had strayed, He, while the thought and eye of the man by chance Were sundered, threw him from the tower-crowned cliff. In anger for which deed the Olympian King, Father of Gods and men, delivered him To be a bond-slave, nor could brook the offence, That of all lives he vanquished, this alone Should have been ta’en by guile. For had he wrought In open quittance of outrageous wrong, Even Zeus had granted that his cause was just. The braggart hath no favour even in Heaven. [page 185][281-316] Whence they, o’erweening with their evil tongue, Are now all dwellers in the house of death, Their ancient city a captive;—but these women Whom thou beholdest, from their blest estate Brought suddenly to taste of piteous woe, Come to thy care. This task thy wedded lord Ordained, and I, his faithful minister, Seek to perform. But, for his noble self, When with pure hands he hath done sacrifice To his Great Father for the victory given, Look for his coming, lady. This last word Of all my happy speech is far most sweet.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Now surety of delight is thine, my Queen, Part by report and part before thine eye.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Yea, now I learn this triumph of my lord, Joy reigns without a rival in my breast. This needs must run with that in fellowship. Yet wise consideration even of good Is flecked with fear of what reverse may come. And I, dear friends, when I behold these maids, Am visited with sadness deep and strange. Poor friendless beings, in a foreign land Wandering forlorn in homeless orphanhood! Erewhile, free daughters of a freeborn race, Now, snared in strong captivity for life. O Zeus of battles, breaker of the war, Ne’er may I see thee turn against my seed So cruelly; or, if thou meanest so, Let me be spared that sorrow by my death! Such fear in me the sight of these hath wrought. Who art thou, of all damsels most distressed? Single or child-bearing? Thy looks would say, A maid, of no mean lineage. Lichas, tell, Who is the stranger-nymph? Who gave her birth? Who was her sire? Mine eye hath pitied her O’er all, as she o’er all hath sense of woe.}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. What know I? Why should’st thou demand? Perchance Not lowest in the list of souls there born.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. How if a princess, offspring of their King?}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 186][317-348] LICH. I cannot tell. I did not question far.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Have none of her companions breathed her name?}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. I brought them silently. I did not hear.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Yet speak it to us of thyself, poor maid! ’Tis sorrow not to know thee who thou art.}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. She’ll ne’er untie her tongue, if she maintain An even tenor, since nor more nor less Would she disclose; but, poor unfortunate! With agonizing sobs and tears she mourns This crushing sorrow, from the day she left Her wind-swept home. Her case is cruel, sure,— And claims a privilege from all who feel.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Well, let her go, and pass beneath the roof In peace, as she desires; nor let fresh pain From me be added to her previous woe. She hath enough already. Come, away! Let’s all within at once, that thou mayest speed Thy journey, and I may order all things here. [Exit LICHAS, with Captives, into the house. DÊANIRA is about to follow them}
\par 

\par  Re-enter Messenger.

\par \textbf{MESS. Pause first there on the threshold, till you learn (Apart from those) who ’tis you take within, And more besides that you yet know not of, Which deeply imports your knowing. Of all this I throughly am informed.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. What cause hast thou Thus to arrest my going?}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Stand, and hear. Not idle was my former speech, nor this.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Say, must we call them back in presence here, Or would’st thou tell thy news to these and me?}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. To thee and these I may, but let those be.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Well, they are gone. Let words declare thy drift.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. That man, in all that he hath lately said, Hath sinned against the truth}
\par   or now he’s false, Or else unfaithful in his first report.

\par \textbf{[page 187][349-384] DÊ. What? Tell me thy full meaning clearly forth. That thou hast uttered is all mystery.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. I heard this herald say, while many thronged To hearken, that this maiden was the cause, Why lofty-towered Oechalia and her lord Fell before Heracles, whom Love alone Of heavenly powers had warmed to this emprise, And not the Lydian thraldom or the tasks Of rigorous Omphalè, nor that wild fate Of rock-thrown Iphitus. Now he thrusts aside The Love-god, contradicting his first tale. When he that was her sire could not be brought To yield the maid for Heracles to hold In love unrecognized, he framed erelong A feud about some trifle, and set forth In arms against this damsel’s fatherland (Where Eurytus, the herald said, was king) And slew the chief her father; yea, and sacked Their city. Now returning, as you see, He sends her hither to his halls, no slave, Nor unregarded, lady,—dream not so! Since all his heart is kindled with desire. I, O my Queen! thought meet to show thee all The tale I chanced to gather from his mouth, Which many heard as well as I, i’ the midst Of Trachis’ market-place, and can confirm My witness. I am pained if my plain speech Sound harshly, but the honest truth I tell.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Ah me! Where am I? Whither am I fallen? What hidden woe have I unwarily Taken beneath my roof? O misery! Was she unknown, as he that brought her sware?}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Nay, most distinguished both in birth and mien; Called in her day of freedom Iolè, Eurytus’ daughter,—of whose parentage, Forsooth as ignorant, he ne’er would speak.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. I curse not all the wicked, but the man Whose secret practices deform his life.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 188][385-413] DÊ. Say, maidens, how must I proceed? The words Now spoken have bewildered all my mind.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Go in and question Lichas, who perchance Will tell the truth if you but tax him home.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. I will; you counsel reasonably.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. And I, Shall I bide here till thou com’st forth? Or how?}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Remain. For see, without my sending for him, He issueth from the palace of himself.}
\par 

\par  Enter LICHAS.

\par \textbf{LICH. What message must I carry to my lord? Tell me, my Queen. I am going, as thou seest.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. So slow in coming, and so quickly flown, Ere one have time to talk with thee anew!}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. What wouldst thou ask me? I am bent to hear.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. And art thou bent on truth in the reply?}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. By Heaven! in all that I have knowledge of.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Then tell me, who is she thou brought’st with thee?}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. An islander. I cannot trace her stock.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Look hither, man. Who is’t to whom thou speakest?}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. Why such a question? What is thine intent?}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Nay, start not, but make answer if thou knowest.}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. To Dêanira, Oeneus’ queenly child, Heracles’ wife,—if these mine eyes be true,— My mistress.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Ay, that is the very word I longed to hear thee speak. Thy mistress, sayest?}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. To whom I am bound.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Hold there! What punishment Wilt thou accept, if thou art found to be Faithless to her?}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. I faithless! What dark speech Hast thou contrived?}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Not I at all. ’Tis thou Dost wrap thy thoughts i’ the dark.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 189][414-448] LICH. Well, I will go. ’Tis folly to have heard thee for so long.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. You go not till you answer one word more.}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. One, or a thousand! You’ll not stint, I see.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Thou knowest the captive maid thou leddest home?}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. I do. But wherefore ask?}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Did you not say That she, on whom you look with ignorant eye, Was Iolè, the daughter of the King, Committed to your charge?}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. Where? Among whom? What witness of such words will bear thee out?}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Many and sound. A goodly company In Trachis’ market-place heard thee speak this.}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. Ay. I said ’twas rumoured. But I could not give My vague impression for advised report.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Impression, quotha! Did you not on oath Proclaim your captive for your master’s bride?}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. My master’s bride! Dear lady, by the Gods, Who is the stranger? for I know him not.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. One who was present where he heard thee tell, How that whole city was subdued and taken, Not for the bondage to the Lydian girl, But through the longing passion for this maid.}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. Dear lady, let the fellow be removed. To prate with madmen is mere foolishness.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Nay, I entreat thee by His name, whose fire Lightens down Oeta’s topmost glen, be not A niggard of the truth. Thou tell’st thy tale To no weak woman, but to one who knows Mankind are never constant to one joy. Whoso would buffet Love, aspires in vain. For Love leads even Immortals at his will, And me. Then how not others, like to me? ’Twere madness, sure, in me to blame my lord When this hath caught him, or the woman there, His innocent accomplice in a thing, No shame to either, and no harm to me. [page 190][449-490] It is not so. But if from him thou learnest The lore of falsehood, it were best unlearnt; Or if the instruction comes of thine own thought, Such would-be kindness doth not prove thee kind. Then tell me all the truth. To one free-born The name of liar is a hateful lot. And thou canst not be hid. Thy news was heard By many, who will tell me. If thou fearest, Thou hast no cause—for doubtfulness is pain, But to know all, what harm? His loves ere now Were they not manifold? And none hath borne Reproach or evil word from me. She shall not, Though his new passion were as strong as death; Since most mine eye hath pitied her, because Her beauty was the ruin of her life, And all unweeting, she her own bright land, Poor hapless one! hath ravaged and enslaved.— Let that be as it must. But for thy part, Though false to others, be still true to me.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. ’Tis fairly said. Comply. Thou ne’er wilt blame Her faithfulness, and thou wilt earn our loves.}
\par 

\par \textbf{LICH. Yea, dear my Queen, now I have seen thee hold Thy mortal wishes within mortal bound So meekly, I will freely tell thee all. It is as he avers. This maiden’s love, Piercing through Heracles, was the sole cause, Why her Oechalia, land of plenteous woe, Was made the conquest of his spear. And he— For I dare so far clear him—never bade Concealment or denial. But myself, Fearing the word might wound thy queenly heart, Sinned, if thou count such tenderness a sin. But now that all is known, for both your sakes, His, and thine own no less, look favouringly Upon the woman, and confirm the word Thou here hast spoken in regard to her}
\par  — For he, whose might is in all else supreme, Is wholly overmastered by her love.

\par \textbf{DÊ. Yea, so my mind is bent. I will do so. [page 191][491-519] I will not, in a bootless strife ’gainst Heaven, Augment my misery with self-sought ill. Come, go we in, that thou may’st bear from me Such message as is meet, and also carry Gifts, such as are befitting to return For gifts new-given. Thou ought’st not to depart Unladen, having brought so much with thee.[Exeunt}

\par  CHORUS.

\par \textbf{Victorious in her might,I 1 The Queen of soft delight Still ranges onward with triumphant sway. What she from Kronos’ son And strong Poseidon won, And Pluto, King of Night, I durst not say.

\par 

\par \textbf{One was a river bold,I 2 Horn-crowned, with tramp fourfold, Bull Achelôüs, Acarnania’s Fear; And one from Bacchus’ town, Own son of Zeus, came down, With brandished mace, bent bow, and barbèd spear.

\par \textbf{But the tender fair one far away Sate watching with an eye of piteous cheer (A mother’s heart will heed the thing I say,) Till won by him who freed her from her fear. Sudden she leaves her mother’s gentle side, Borne through the waste, our hero’s tender bride.}

\par  Enter DÊANIRA.

\par \textbf{DÊ. Dear friends, while yonder herald in the house Holds converse with the captives ere he go, I have stol’n forth to you, partly to tell The craft my hand hath compassed, and in part, To crave your pity for my wretchedness. For I have taken to my hearth a maid,— And yet, methinks, no maiden any more, Like some fond shipmaster, taking on board A cargo fraught with treason to my heart. And now we two are closed in one embrace Beneath one coverlet. Such generous meed For faith in guarding home this dreary while Hath the kind Heracles our trusty spouse, Sent in return! Yet, oft as he hath caught This same distemperature, I know not how To harbour indignation against him. But who that is a woman could endure To dwell with her, both married to one man? One bloom is still advancing, one doth fade. The budding flower is cropped, the full-blown head Is left to wither, while love passeth by Unheeding. Wherefore I am sore afraid He will be called my husband, but her mate, For she is younger. Yet no prudent wife Would take this angerly, as I have said. But, dear ones, I will tell you of a way, Whereof I have bethought me, to prevent This heart-break. I had hidden of long time [page 193][555-591] In a bronze urn the ancient Centaur’s gift, Which I, when a mere girl, culled from the wound Of hairy-breasted Nessus in his death. He o’er Evenus’ rolling depths, for hire, Ferried wayfarers on his arm, not plying Or rowing-boat, or canvas-wingèd bark. Who, when with Heracles, a new-made bride, I followed by my father’s sending forth, Shouldering me too, in the mid-stream, annoyed With wanton touch. And I cried out; and he, Zeus’ son, turned suddenly, and from his bow Sent a wing’d shaft, that whizzed into his chest To the lungs. Then the weird Thing, with dying voice Spake to me}
\par  —‘Child of aged Oeneüs, Since thou wert my last burden, thou shalt win Some profit from mine act, if thou wilt do What now I bid thee. With a careful hand Collect and bear away the clotted gore That clogs my wound, e’en where the monster snake Had dyed the arrow with dark tinct of gall; And thou shalt have this as a charm of soul For Heracles, that never through the eye Shall he receive another love than thine.’ Whereof bethinking me, for since his death I kept it in a closet locked with care, I have applied it to this robe, with such Addition as his living voice ordained.— The thing is done. No criminal attempts Could e’er be mine. Far be they from my thought, As I abhor the woman who conceives them! But if by any means through gentle spells And bonds on Heracles’ affection, we May triumph o’er this maiden in his heart, My scheme is perfected. Unless you deem Mine action wild. If so, I will desist.

\par \textbf{CH. If any ground of confidence approve Thine act, we cannot check thy counsel here.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. My confidence is grounded on belief, Though unconfirmed as yet by actual proof.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 194][592-627] CH. Well, do it and try. Assurance cannot come Till action bring experience after it.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. The truth will soon be known. The man e’en now Is coming forth, and quickly will be there. Screen ye but well my counsel. Doubtful deeds, Wrapt close, will not deliver us to shame.}
\par 

\par  Enter LICHAS.

\par \textbf{LICH. Daughter of Oeneus, tell me thy commands. Already time rebukes our tardiness.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Even that hath been my care, Lichas, while thou Wert talking to the stranger-maids within, That thou shouldst take for me this finewoven web, A present from these fingers to my lord. And when thou giv’st it, say that none of men Must wear it on his shoulders before him; And neither light of sun may look upon it, Nor holy temple-court, nor household flame, Till he in open station ’fore the Gods Display it on a day when bulls are slaughtered. So once I vowed, that should I ever see Or hear his safe return, I would enfold His glorious person in this robe, and show To all the Gods in doing sacrifice Him a fresh worshipper in fresh array.— The truth hereof he will with ease descry Betokened on this treasure-guarding seal.— Now go, and be advised, of this in chief, To act within thine office; then of this, To bear thee so, that from his thanks and mine Meeting in one, a twofold grace may spring.}

\par 

\par  Enter DÊANIRA.

\par \textbf{DÊ. O how I fear, my friends, lest all too far I have ventured in my action of to-day!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. What ails thee, Dêanira, Oeneus’ child?}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. I know not, but am haunted by a dread, Lest quickly I be found to have performed A mighty mischief, through bright hopes betrayed.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Thou dost not mean thy gift to Heracles?}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. Indeed I do. Now I perceive how fond Is eagerness, where actions are obscure.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Tell, if it may be told, thy cause of fear.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. A thing is come to pass, which should I tell, Will strike you with strange wonder when you learn. For, O my friends, the stuff wherewith I dressed That robe, a flock of soft and milkwhite wool, Is shrivelled out of sight, not gnawn by tooth Of any creature here, but, self-consumed, Frittered and wasting on the courtyard-stones. To let you know the circumstance at full, I will speak on. Of all the Centaur-Thing, When labouring in his side with the fell point O’ the shaft, enjoined me, I had nothing lost, But his vaticination in my heart Remained indelible, as though engraved With pen of iron upon brass. ’Twas thus}
\par  — I was to keep this unguent closely hid In dark recesses, where no heat of fire Or warming ray might reach it, till with fresh Anointing I addressed it to an end. So I had done. And now this was to do, Within my chamber covertly I spread The ointment with piece of wool, a tuft Pulled from a home-bred sheep; and, as ye saw, I folded up my gift and packed it close In hollow casket from the glaring sun. But, entering in, a fact encounters me Past human wit to fathom with surmise. For, as it happened, I had tossed aside The bit of wool I worked with, carelessly, [page 197][696-733] Into the open daylight, ’mid the blaze Of Helios’ beam. And, as it kindled warm, It fell away to nothing, crumbled small, Like dust in severing wood by sawyers strewn. So, on the point of vanishing, it lay. But, from the place where it had lain, brake forth A frothy scum in clots of seething foam, Like the rich draught in purple vintage poured From Bacchus’ vine upon the thirsty ground. And I, unhappy, know not toward what thought To turn me, but I see mine act is dire. For wherefore should the Centaur, for what end, Show kindness to the cause for whom he died? That cannot be. But seeking to destroy His slayer, he cajoled me. This I learn Too late, by sad experience, for no good. And, if I err not now, my hapless fate Is all alone to be his murderess. For, well I know, the shaft that made the wound Gave pain to Cheiron, who was more than man; And wheresoe’er it falls, it ravageth All the wild creatures of the world. And now This gory venom blackly spreading bane From Nessus’ angry wound, must it not cause The death of Heracles? I think it must. Yet my resolve is firm, if aught harm him, My death shall follow in the self-same hour. She cannot bear to live in evil fame, Who cares to have a nature pure from ill.

\par \textbf{CH. Horrid mischance must needs occasion fear. But Hope is not condemned before the event.}
\par 

\par \textbf{DÊ. In ill-advised proceeding not even Hope Remains to minister a cheerful mind.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Yet to have erred unwittingly abates The fire of wrath; and thou art in this case.}

There first I saw him, gladdened from desire. And when he now addressed him to the work Of various sacrifice, the herald Lichas Arrived from home, bearing thy fatal gift, The deadly robe}
\par   wherewith invested straight, As thou hadst given charge, he sacrificed The firstlings of the spoil, twelve bulls entire, Each after each. But the full count he brought Was a clear hundred of all kinds of head. Then the all-hapless one commenced his prayer In solemn gladness for the bright array. But presently, when from the holy things, And from the richness of the oak-tree core, [page 199][766-802] There issued flame mingled with blood, a sweat Rose on his flesh, and close to every limb Clung, like stone-drapery from the craftsman’s hand, The garment, glued unto his side. Then came The tearing pangs within his bones, and then The poison feasted like the venomed tooth Of murderous basilisk.—When this began, He shouted on poor Lichas, none to blame For thy sole crime, ‘What guile is here, thou knave? What was thy fraud in fetching me this robe?’ He, all-unknowing, in an evil hour Declared his message, that the gift was thine. Whereat the hero, while the shooting spasm Had fastened on the lungs, seized him by the foot Where the ankle turns i’ the socket, and, with a thought, Hurl’d on a surf-vex’d reef that showed i’ the sea:  And rained the grey pulp from the hair, the brain Being scattered with the blood. Then the great throng Saddened their festival with piteous wail For one in death and one in agony. And none had courage to approach my sire,— Convulsed upon the ground, then tossed i’ the air With horrid yells and crying, till the cliffs Echoed round, the mountain-promontories Of Locris, and Euboea’s rugged shore. Wearied at length with flinging on the earth, And shrieking oft with lamentable cry, Cursing the fatal marriage with thyself The all-wretched, and the bond to Oeneus’ house, That prize that was the poisoner of his peace, He lifted a wild glance above the smoke That hung around, and ’midst the crowd of men Saw me in tears, and looked on me and said, ‘O son, come near; fly not from my distress, Though thou shouldst be consumèd in my death, But lift and bear me forth; and, if thou mayest, Set me where no one of mankind shall see me. But if thy heart withhold thee, yet convey me Out of this land as quickly as ye may. Let me not die where I am now.’ We then, [page 200][803-833] Thus urgently commanded, laid him down Within our bark, and hardly to this shore Rowed him convulsed and roaring.—Presently, He will appear, alive or lately dead. Such, mother, is the crime thou hast devised And done against our sire, wherefore let Right And Vengeance punish thee!—May I pray so? I may:  for thou absolv’st me by thy deed, Thou that hast slain the noblest of the Earth, Thy spouse, whose like thou ne’er wilt see again. [Exit DÊANIRA.

\par \textbf{See where falls the doom, of oldI 1 By the unerring Voice foretold,— ‘When twelve troublous years have rolled, Then shall end your long desire}
\par   Toil on toil no more shall tire The offspring of the Eternal Sire.’ Lo! the destined Hour is come! Lo! it hath brought its burden home. For when the eyes have looked their last How should sore labour vex again? How, when the powers of will and thought are past, Should life be any more enthralled to pain?

\par \textbf{CH. Could this be ventured by a woman’s hand?}

\par \textbf{NUR. Ay, and in dreadful wise, as thou shalt hear. When all alone she had gone within the gate, And passing through the court beheld her boy Spreading the couch that should receive his sire, [page 203][902-946] Ere he returned to meet him,—out of sight She hid herself, and fell at the altar’s foot, And loudly cried that she was left forlorn; And, taking in her touch each household thing That formerly she used, poor lady, wept O’er all; and then went ranging through the rooms, Where, if there caught her eye the well-loved form Of any of her household, she would gaze And weep aloud, accusing her own fate And her abandoned lot, childless henceforth! When this was ended, suddenly I see her Fly to the hero’s room of genial rest. With unsuspected gaze o’ershadowed near, I watched, and saw her casting on the bed The finest sheets of all. When that was done, She leapt upon the couch where they had lain And sat there in the midst. And the hot flood Burst from her eyes before she spake}
\par  —‘Farewell, My bridal bed, for never more shalt thou Give me the comfort I have known thee give.’ Then with tight fingers she undid her robe, Where the brooch lay before the breast, and bared All her left arm and side. I, with what speed Strength ministered, ran forth to tell her son The act she was preparing. But meanwhile, Ere we could come again, the fatal blow Fell, and we saw the wound. And he, her boy, Seeing, wept aloud. For now the hapless youth Knew that himself had done this in his wrath, Told all too late i’ the house, how she had wrought Most innocently, from the Centaur’s wit. So now the unhappy one, with passionate words And cries and wild embracings of the dead, Groaned forth that he had slain her with false breath Of evil accusation, and was left Orphaned of both, his mother and his sire. Such is the state within. What fool is he That counts one day, or two, or more to come? To-morrow is not, till the present day In fair prosperity have passed away. [Exit

For, glued unto my side, it hath devoured My flesh to the bone, and lodging in the lungs It drains the vital channels, and hath drunk The fresh life-blood, and ruins all my frame, Foiled in the tangle of a viewless bond.

And so this Centaur, as the voice Divine Then prophesied, in death hath slain me living. And in agreement with that ancient word I now interpret newer oracles Which I wrote down on going within the grove Of the hill-roving and earth-couching Selli,— Dictated to me by the mystic tongue Innumerous, of my Father’s sacred tree; Declaring that my ever instant toils Should in the time that new hath being and life End and release me. And I look’d for joy. But the true meaning plainly was my death.— No labour is appointed for the dead.— Then, since all argues one event, my son, Once more thou must befriend me, and not wait For my voice goading thee, but of thyself Submit and second my resolve, and know Filial obedience for thy noblest rule.}

\par  [page 216] It was fated that Troy should be taken by Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles, assisted by the bow of Heracles in the hands of Philoctetes.

\par  Now Philoctetes had been rejected by the army because of a trouble in his foot, which made his presence with them insufferable; and had been cast away by Odysseus on the island of Lemnos.

\par  But when the decree of fate was revealed by prophecy, Odysseus undertook to bring Philoctetes back, and took with him Neoptolemus, whose ambition could only be gratified through the return of Philoctetes with the bow.

\par  Philoctetes was resolutely set against returning, and at the opening of the drama Neoptolemus is persuaded by Odysseus to take him with guile.

\par  But when Philoctetes appears, the youth’s ingenuous nature is so wrought upon through pity and remorse, that his sympathy and native truthfulness at length overcome his ambition.

\par  When the inward sacrifice is complete, Heracles appears from heaven, and by a few words changes the mind of Philoctetes, so that all ends well.

Now most behoves thy service, to explore This headland for a cave with double mouth, Whose twofold aperture, on wintry days, Gives choice of sunshine, and in summer noons The breeze wafts slumber through the airy cell. Then, something lower down, upon the left, Unless ’tis dried, thine eye may note a spring. Go near now silently, and make me know If still he persevere, and hold this spot, Or have roamed elsewhere, that informed of this I may proceed with what remains to say, And we may act in concert.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEOPTOLEMUS. Lord Odysseus, Thy foremost errand will not task me far. Methinks I see the cave whereof thou speakest.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. Where? let me see it. Above there, or below?}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 218][29-64]}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Yonder, above. And yet I hear no tread. [NEOPTOLEMUS climbs up to the cave}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. Look if he be not lodged in slumber there.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. I find no inmate, but an empty room.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. What? no provision for a dwelling-place?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. A bed of leaves for some one harbouring here.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. Nought else beneath the roof? Is all forlorn?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. A cup of wood, some untaught craftsman’s skill, And, close at hand, these embers of a fire.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. That store is his. I read the token clear.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Oh! and these festering rags give evidence, Steeped as with dressing some malignant sore.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. The man inhabits here}
\par   I know it now. And sure he’s not far off. How can he range, Whose limb drags heavy with an ancient harm? But he’s gone, either to bring forage home, Or where he hath found some plant of healing power. Send therefore thine attendant to look forth, Lest unawares he find me. All our host Were not so fair a prize for him as I.

\par \textbf{NEO. My man is going, and shall watch the path. What more dost thou require of me? Speak on.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. Son of Achilles, know that thou art come To serve us nobly, not with strength alone, But, faithful to thy mission, if so be, To do things strange, unwonted to thine ear.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. What dost thou bid me?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. ’Tis thy duty now To entrap the mind of Poeas’ son with words. When he shall ask thee, who and whence thou art, Declare thy name and father. ’Tis not that I charge thee to conceal. But for thy voyage, ’Tis homeward, leaving the Achaean host, With perfect hatred hating them, because They who had drawn thee with strong prayers from home, Their hope for taking Troy, allowed thee not Thy just demand to have thy father’s arms, But, e’er thy coming, wrongly gave them o’er [page 219][64-101] Unto Odysseus}
\par   and thereon launch forth With boundless execration against me. That will not pain me, but if thou reject This counsel, thou wilt trouble all our host, Since, if his bow shall not be ta’en, thy life Will ne’er be crowned through Troy’s discomfiture. Now let me show, why thine approach to him Is safe and trustful as mine cannot be Thou didst sail forth, not to redeem thine oath, Nor by constraint, nor with the foremost band. All which reproaches I must bear:  and he, But seeing me, while master of his bow, Will slay me, and my ruin will be thine. This point then craves our cunning, to acquire By subtle means the irresistible bow— Thy nature was not framed, I know it well, For speaking falsehood, or contriving harm. Yet, since the prize of victory is so dear, Endure it—We’ll be just another day But now, for one brief hour, devote thyself To serve me without shame, and then for aye Hereafter be the pearl of righteousness.

\par \textbf{NEO. The thing that, being named, revolts mine ear, Son of Laërtes, I abhor to do ’Tis not my nature, no, nor, as they tell, My father’s, to work aught by craft and guile. I’ll undertake to bring him in by force, Not by deceit. For, sure, with his one foot, He cannot be a match for all our crew Being sent, my lord, to serve thee, I am loth To seem rebellious. But I rather choose To offend with honour, than to win by wrong.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. Son of a valiant sire, I, too, in youth, Had once a slow tongue and an active hand. But since I have proved the world, I clearly see Words and not deeds give mastery over men.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. What then is thy command? To lie? No more?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. To entangle Philoctetes with deceit.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 210][102-134] NEO. Why through deceit? May not persuasion fetch him?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. Never. And force as certainly will fail.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. What lends him such assurance of defence?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. Arrows, the unerring harbingers of Death.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Then to go near him is a perilous thing.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. Unless with subtlety, as I have said.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. And is not lying shameful to thy soul?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. Not if by lying I can save my soul.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. How must one look in speaking such a word?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. Where gain invites, this shrinking is not good.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. What gain I through his coming back to Troy?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. His arms alone have power to take Troy-town.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Then am not I the spoiler, as ye said?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. Thou without them, they without thee, are powerless.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. If it be so, they must be sought and won.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. Yea, for in this two prizes will be thine.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. What? When I learn them, I will not refuse.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. Wisdom and valour joined in one good name.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Shame, to the winds! Come, I will do this thing.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. Say, dost thou bear my bidding full in mind?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Doubt not, since once for all I have embraced it.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. Thou, then, await him here. I will retire, For fear my hated presence should be known, And take back our attendant to the ship. And then once more, should ye appear to waste The time unduly, I will send again This same man hither in disguise, transformed To the strange semblance of a merchantman; From dark suggestion of whose crafty tongue, Thou, O my son, shalt gather timely counsel. Now to my ship. This charge I leave to thee. May secret Hermes guide us to our end, And civic Pallas, named of victory, The sure protectress of my devious way.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 221][135-162]}
\par 

\par  CHORUS (entering).

\par \textbf{Strange in the stranger land,I 1 What shall I speak? What hide From a heart suspicious of ill? Tell me, O master mine! Wise above all is the man, Peerless in searching thought, Who with the Zeus-given wand Wieldeth a Heaven-sent power. This unto thee, dear son, Fraught with ancestral might, This to thy life hath come. Wherefore I bid thee declare, What must I do for thy need?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Even now methinks thou longest to espy Near ocean’s marge the place where he doth lie. Gaze without fear. But when the traveller stern, Who from this roof is parted, shall return, Advancing still as I the signal give, To serve each moment’s mission thou shalt strive.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. That, O my son, from of oldI 2 Hath been my care, to take note What by thy beck’ning is told; Still thy success to promote. But for our errand to-day Behoves thee, master, to say Where is the hearth of his home; Or where even now doth he roam? O tell me, lest all unaware He spring like a wolf from his lair And I by surprise should be ta’en, Where doth he move or remain, Here lodging, or wandering away?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Thou seëst yon double doorway of his cell, Poor habitation of the rock.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. 2. But tell Where is the pain-worn wight himself abroad?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. To me ’tis clear, that, in his quest for food, [page 222][163-204] Here, not far off, he trails yon furrowed path. For, so ’tis told, this mode the sufferer hath Of sustenance, oh hardness! bringing low Wild creatures with wing’d arrows from his bow; Nor findeth healer for his troublous woe.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. I feel his misery.II 1 With no companion eye, Far from all human care, He pines with fell disease; Each want he hourly sees Awakening new despair. How can he bear it still? O cruel Heavens! O pain Of that afflicted mortal train Whose life sharp sorrows fill!}
\par 

\par \textbf{Born in a princely hall,II 2 Highest, perchance, of all, Now lies he comfortless Alone in deep distress, ’Mongst rough and dappled brutes, With pangs and hunger worn; While from far distance shoots, On airy pinion borne, The unbridled Echo, still replying To his most bitter crying.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. At nought of this I marvel—for if I Judge rightly, there assailed him from on high That former plague through Chrysa’s cruel sting}
\par   And if to-day he suffer anything With none to soothe, it must be from the will Of some great God, so caring to fulfil The word of prophecy, lest he should bend On Troy the shaft no mortal may forfend, Before the arrival of Troy’s destined hour, When she must fall, o’er-mastered by their power.

\par \textbf{CH. 1. Hush, my son!III 1}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Why so?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. 1. A sound Gendered of some mortal woe, [page 223][205-237] Started from the neighbouring ground. Here, or there? Ah! now I know. Hark! ’tis the voice of one in pain, Travelling hardly, the deep strain Of human anguish, all too clear, That smites my heart, that wounds mine ear.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. 2. From far it peals. But thou, my son!III 2}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. What?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. 2. Think again. He moveth nigh}
\par   He holds the region:  not with tone Of piping shepherd’s rural minstrelsy, But belloweth his far cry, Stumbling perchance with mortal pain, Or else in wild amaze, As he our ship surveys Unwonted on the inhospitable main.

\par  Enter PHILOCTETES.

\par \textbf{PHILOCTETES. Ho! What men are ye that to this desert shore, Harbourless, uninhabited, are come On shipboard? Of what country or what race Shall I pronounce ye? For your outward garb Is Grecian, ever dearest to this heart That hungers now to hear your voices’ tune. Ah! do not fear me, do not shrink away From my wild looks}
\par   but, pitying one so poor, Forlorn and desolate in nameless woe, Speak, if with friendly purpose ye are come. Oh answer! ’Tis not meet that I should lose This kindness from your lips, or ye from mine.

\par \textbf{NEO. Then know this first, O stranger, as thou wouldest, That we are Greeks.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. O dear, dear name! Ah me! In all these years, once, only once, I hear it! My son, what fairest gale hath wafted thee? What need hath brought thee to the shore? What mission? [page 224][238-273] Declare all this, that I may know thee well.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. The sea-girt Scyros is my native home. Thitherward I make voyage}
\par  —Achilles’ son, Named Neoptolemus.—I have told thee all.

\par \textbf{PHI. Dear is that shore to me, dear is thy father O ancient Lycomedes’ foster-child, Whence cam’st thou hither? How didst thou set forth?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. From Troy we made our course in sailing hither.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. How? Sure thou wast not with us, when at first We launched our vessels on the Troyward way?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Hadst thou a share in that adventurous toil?}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. And know’st thou not whom thou behold’st in me, Young boy?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. How should I know him whom I ne’er Set eye on?}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Hast not even heard my name, Nor echoing rumour of my ruinous woe?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Nay, I know nought of all thy questioning.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. How full of griefs am I, how Heaven-abhorred, When of my piteous state no faintest sound Hath reached my home, or any Grecian land! But they, who pitilessly cast me forth, Keep silence and are glad, while this my plague Blooms ever, and is strengthened more and more. Boy, great Achilles’ offspring, in this form Thou seest the man, of whom, methinks, erewhile Thou hast been told, to whom the Hercúlean bow Descended, Philoctetes, Poeas’ son; Whom the two generals and the Ithacan king Cast out thus shamefully forlorn, afflicted With the fierce malady and desperate wound Made by the cruel basilisk’s murderous tooth. With this for company they left me, child! Exposed upon this shore, deserted, lone. From seaward Chrysa came they with their fleet And touched at Lemnos. I had fallen to rest From the long tossing, in a shadowy cave On yonder cliff by the shore. Gladly they saw, And left me, having set forth for my need, [page 225][273-314] Poor man, some scanty rags, and a thin store Of provender. Such food be theirs, I pray! Imagine, O my son, when they were gone, What wakening, what arising, then was mine; What weeping, what lamenting of my woe! When I beheld the ships, wherewith I sailed, Gone, one and all! and no man in the place, None to bestead me, none to comfort me In my sore sickness. And where’er I looked, Nought but distress was present with me still. No lack of that, for one thing!—Ah! my son, Time passed, and there I found myself alone Within my narrow lodging, forced to serve Each pressing need. For body’s sustenance This bow supplied me with sufficient store, Wounding the feathered doves, and when the shaft, From the tight string, had struck, myself, ay me! Dragging this foot, would crawl to my swift prey. Then water must be fetched, and in sharp frost Wood must be found and broken,—all by me. Nor would fire come unbidden, but with flint From flints striking dim sparks, I hammered forth The struggling flame that keeps the life in me. For houseroom with the single help of fire Gives all I need, save healing for my sore. Now learn, my son, the nature of this isle. No mariner puts in here willingly. For it hath neither moorage, nor sea-port, For traffic or kind shelter or good cheer. Not hitherward do prudent men make voyage. Perchance one may have touched against his will. Many strange things may happen in long time. These, when they come, in words have pitied me, And given me food, or raiment, in compassion. But none is willing, when I speak thereof, To take me safely home. Wherefore I pine Now this tenth year, in famine and distress, Feeding the hunger of my ravenous plague. Such deeds, my son, the Atridae, and the might Of sage Odysseus, have performed on me. [page 226][315-349] Wherefore may all the Olympian gods, one day, Plague them with stern requital for my wrong!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Methinks my feeling for thee, Poeas’ child, Is like that of thy former visitants.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. I, too, a witness to confirm his words, Know them for verities, since I have found The Atridae and Odysseus evil men.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Art thou, too, wroth with the all-pestilent sons Of Atreus? Have they given thee cause to grieve?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Would that my hand might ease the wrath I feel! Then Sparta and Mycenae should be ware That Scyros too breeds valiant sons for war.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Brave youth! I love thee. Tell me the great cause Why thou inveighest against them with such heat?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. O son of Poeas, hardly shall I tell What outrage I endured when I had come; Yet I will speak it. When the fate of death O’ertook Achilles—}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Out, alas! no more! Hold, till thou first hast made me clearly know, Is Peleus’ offspring dead?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Alas! he is, Slain by no mortal, felled by Phoebus’ shaft}
\par   So men reported—

\par \textbf{PHI. Well, right princely was he! And princely is he who slew him. Shall I mourn Him first, or wait till I have heard thy tale?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Methinks thou hast thyself enough to mourn, Without the burden of another’s woe.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Well spoken. Then renew thine own complaint, And tell once more wherein they insulted thee.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. There came to fetch me, in a gallant ship, Odysseus and the fosterer of my sire, Saying, whether soothly, or in idle show, That, since my father perished, it was known None else but I should take Troy’s citadel. Such words from them, my friend, thou may’st believe, Held me not long from making voyage with speed, [page 227][350-385] Chiefly through longing for my father’s corse, To see him yet unburied,—for I ne’er Had seen him. Then, besides, ’twas a fair cause, If, by my going, I should vanquish Troy. One day I had sailed, and on the second came To sad Sigeum with wind-favoured speed, When straightway all the host, surrounding me As I set foot on shore, saluted me, And swore the dead Achilles was in life, Their eyes being witness, when they looked on me. He lay there in his shroud}
\par   but I, unhappy, Soon ending lamentation for the dead, Went near to those Atridae, as to friends, To obtain my father’s armour and all else That had been his. And then,—alas the while, That men should be so hard!—they spake this word:  ‘Seed of Achilles, thou may’st freely take All else thy father owned, but for those arms, Another wields them now, Laërtes’ son.’ Tears rushed into mine eyes, and in hot wrath I straightway rose, and bitterly outspake:  ‘O miscreant! What? And have ye dared to give Mine arms to some man else, unknown to me?’ Then said Odysseus, for he chanced to be near, ‘Yea, child, and justly have they given me these. I saved them and their master in the field.’ Then in fierce anger all at once I launched All terms of execration at his head, Bating no word, being maddened by the thought That I should lose this heirloom,—and to him! He, at this pass, though not of wrathful mood, Stung by such utterance, made rejoinder thus:  ‘Thou wast not with us here, but wrongfully Didst bide afar. And, since thou mak’st so bold, I tell thee, never shalt thou, as thou sayest, Sail with these arms to Scyros.’—Thus reviled, With such an evil echo in mine ear, I voyage homeward, robbed of mine own right By that vile offset of an evil tree. Yet less I blame him than the men in power. [page 228][386-423] For every multitude, be it army or state, Takes tone from those who rule it, and all taint Of disobedience from bad counsel springs. I have spoken. May the Atridae’s enemy Be dear to Heaven, as he is loved by me!

\par \textbf{CH. Mother of mightiest Zeus,1 Feeder of all that live, Who from thy mountainous breast Rivers of gold dost give! To thee, O Earth, I cried that shameful day, When insolence from Atreus’ sons went forth Full on our lord}
\par   when they bestowed away His father’s arms to crown Odysseus’ worth; Thou, whom bull-slaughtering lions yoked bear, O mighty mother, hear!

\par \textbf{PHI. Your coming is commended by a grief That makes you kindly welcome. For I feel A chord that vibrates to your voice, and tells, Thus have Odysseus and the Atridae wrought. Full well I know, Odysseus’ poisoned tongue Shrinks from no mischief nor no guileful word That leads to bad achievement in the end. This moves not my main marvel, but if one Saw this and bore it,—Aias of the shield.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Ah, friend, he was no more. Had he but lived, This robbery had ne’er been wrought on me.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. What? Is he too departed?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. He is dead. The light no more beholds him.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Oh! alas! But Tydeus’ offspring, and the rascal birth Laërtes bought of Sisyphus, they live}
\par   I know it. For their death were to be wished.

\par \textbf{NEO. Yea, be assured, they live and flourish high Exalted in the host of Argive men.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. And Nestor, my old friend, good aged man, Is he yet living? Oft he would prevent Their evils, by the wisdom of his thought.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 229][424-461] NEO. He too is now in trouble, having lost Antilochus, the comfort of his age.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. There, there! In one brief word thou hast revealed The mournful case of twain, whom I would last Have chosen to hear of as undone. Ah me! Where must one look? when these are dead, and he, Odysseus, lives,—and in a time like this, That craves their presence, and his death for theirs.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. He wrestles cleverly; but, O my friend, Even ablest wits are ofttimes snared at last.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Tell me, I pray, what was become of him, Patroclus, whom thy father loved so well?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. He, too, was gone. I’ll teach thee in a word One truth for all. War doth not willingly Snatch off the wicked, but still takes the good.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. True! and to prove thy saying, I will inquire The fate of a poor dastard, of mean worth, But ever shrewd and nimble with his tongue.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Whom but Odysseus canst thou mean by this?}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. I meant not him. But there was one Thersites, Who ne’er made conscience to stint speech, where all Cried ‘Silence!’ Is he living, dost thou know?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. I saw him not, but knew he was alive.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. He must be}
\par   for no evil yet was crushed. The Heavens will ever shield it. ’Tis their sport To turn back all things rancorous and malign From going down to the grave, and send instead The good and true. Oh, how shall we commend Such dealings, how defend them? When I praise Things god-like, I find evil in the Gods.

\par \textbf{NEO. I, O thou child of a Trachinian sire, Henceforth will take good care, from far away To look on Troy and Atreus’ children twain. Yea, where the trickster lords it o’er the just, And goodness languishes and rascals rule, —Such courses I will nevermore endure. But rock-bound Scyros henceforth shall suffice To yield me full contentment in my home. Now, to my vessel! And thou, Poeas’ child, [page 230][462-499] Farewell, right heartily farewell! May Heaven Grant thy desire, and rid thee of thy plague! Let us be going, that when God shall give Fair voyage, that moment we may launch away.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. My son, are ye now setting forth?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Our time Bids us go near and look to sail erelong.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Now, by thy father, by thy mother,—nay, By all thy love e’er cherished in thy home, Suppliant I beg thee, leave me not thus lone, Forlorn in all my misery which thou seest, In all thou hast heard of here surrounding me! Stow me with other freightage. Full of care, I know, and burdensome the charge may prove. Yet venture! Surely to the noble mind All shame is hateful and all kindness blest. And shame would be thy meed, didst thou fail here But, doing this, thou shalt have glorious fame, When I return alive to Oeta’s vale. Come, ’tis the labour not of one whole day. So thou durst take me, fling me where thou wilt O’ the ship, in hold, prow, stern, or wheresoe’er I least may trouble those on board with me. Ah! by great Zeus, the suppliant’s friend, comply, My son, be softened! See, where I am fall’n Thus on my knees before thee, though so weak, Crippled and powerless. Ah! forsake me not Thus far from human footstep. Take me, take me! If only to thy home, or to the town Of old Chalcodon in Euboea.—From thence I have not far to Oeta, and the ridge Of Trachis, and Spercheius’ lordly flood. So thou shalt bless my father with my sight. And yet long since I fear he may be gone. For oft I sent him suppliant prayers by men Who touched this isle, entreating him to fetch And bear me safely home with his own crew. But either he is dead, or else, methinks, It well may be, my messengers made light Of my concerns, and hastened onward home. [page 231][500-536] But now in thee I find both messenger And convoy, thou wilt pity me and save. For, well thou knowest, danger never sleeps, And fear of dark reverse is always nigh. Mortals, when free, should look where mischief lurks, And in their happiest hour consider well Their life, lest ruin unsuspected come.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Pity him, O my king!2 Many a crushing woe He telleth, such as I pray None of my friends may know. And if, dear master, thou mislikest sore Yon cruel-hearted lordly pair, I would, Turning their plan of evil to his good, On swift ship bear him to his native shore, Meeting his heart’s desire; and free thy path From fear of heavenly wrath.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Thou mak’st small scruple here; but be advised}
\par   Lest, when this plague on board shall weary thee, Thy voice should alter from this liberal tone.

\par \textbf{CH. No, truly! Fear not thou shalt ever have Just cause to utter such reproach on me.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Then sure ’twere shame, should I more backward prove Than thou, to labour for the stranger’s need. Come, if thou wilt, let us make voyage, and he, Let him set forth with speed. Our ship shall take him. He shall not be refused. Only may Heaven Lead safely hence and to our destined port!}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. O morning full of brightness! Kindest friend, Sweet mariners, how can I make you feel, In act, how dearly from my heart I love you! Ye have won my soul. Let us be gone, my son,— First having said farewell to this poor cave, My homeless dwelling-place, that thou may’st know, How barely I have lived, how firm my heart! Methinks another could not have endured [page 232][537-572] The very sight of what I bore. But I Through strong necessity have conquered pain.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Stay}
\par   let us understand. There come two men A stranger, with a shipmate of thy crew. When ye have heard them, ye may then go in.

\par  Enter Messenger, disguised as a merchantman.

\par \textbf{MERCHANTMAN. Son of Achilles, my companion here, Who with two more remained to guard thy ship, Agreed to help me find thee where thou wert, Since unexpectedly, through fortune’s will, I meet thee, mooring by the self-same shore. For like a merchantman, with no great sail, Making my course from Ilion to my home, Grape-clustered Peparethos, when I heard The mariners declare that one and all Were of thy crew, I would not launch again, Without a word, till we had told our news.— Methinks thou knowest nought of thine own case, What new devices of the Argive chiefs Surround thee; nor devices only now, But active deeds, no longer unperformed.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Well, stranger, for the kindness thou hast shown,— Else were I base,—my heart must thank thee still. But tell me what thou meanest, that I may learn What new-laid plot thou bring’st me from the camp.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MER. Old Phoenix, Acamas and Demophon Are gone in thy pursuit with ships and men.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. To bring me back with reasons or perforce?}
\par 

\par \textbf{MER. I know not. What I heard, I am here to tell.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. How? And is this in act? Are they set forth To please the Atridae, Phoenix and the rest?}
\par 

\par \textbf{MER. The thing is not to do, but doing now.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. What kept Odysseus back, if this be so, From going himself? Had he some cause for fear?}
\par 

\par \textbf{MER. He and the son of Tydeus, when our ship Hoist sail, were gone to fetch another man.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. For whom could he himself be sailing forth?}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 233][573-607] MER. For some one,—but first tell me, whispering low Whate’er thou speakest,—who is this I see?}
\par

\par 

\par \textbf{MER. (aside to NEOPTOLEMUS). Without more question, snatch thyself away And sail forth from this land.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. What saith he, boy? Through what dark traffic is the mariner Betraying me with whispering in thine ear?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. I have not caught it, but whate’er he speaks He must speak openly to us and thee.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MER. Seed of Achilles, let me not offend The army by my words! Full many a boon, Being poor, I reap from them for service done.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. The Atridae are my foes; the man you see Is my fast friend, because he hates them sore. Then, if you come in kindness, you must hide Nothing from him or me of all thou hast heard.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MER. Look what thou doest, my son!}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. I mark it well.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MER. Thou shalt be answerable.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Content}
\par   but speak.

\par \textbf{MER. Then hear me. These two men whom I have named, Diomedes and Odysseus, are set forth Engaged on oath to bring this man by force If reasons fail. The Achaeans every one Have heard this plainly from Odysseus’ mouth. He was the louder and more confident.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Say, for what cause, after so long a time, Can Atreus’ sons have turned their thoughts on him, Whom long they had cast forth? What passing touch Of conscience moved them, or what stroke from Heaven, Whose wrath requites all wicked deeds of men?}
\par 

\par \textbf{MER. Methinks thou hast not heard what I will now Unfold to thee. There was a princely seer, A son of Priam, Helenus by name, Whom he for whom no word is bad enough, [page 234][608-645] Crafty Odysseus, sallying forth alone One night, had taken, and in bonds displayed ‘Fore all the Achaeans, a right noble prey. He, ’mid his other prophecies, foretold No Grecian force should sack Troy’s citadel, Till with fair reasons they had brought this man From Lemnos isle, his lonely dwelling-place. When thus the prophet spake, Laërtes’ son Straight undertook to fetch this man, and show him To all the camp}
\par  —he hoped, with fair consent:  But else, perforce.—And, if he failed in this, Whoever would might smite him on the head. My tale is told, dear youth. I counsel speed To thee and to the friend for whom thou carest.

\par \textbf{PHI. Ah me, unhappy! has that rascal knave Sworn to fetch me with reasons to their camp? As likely might his reasons bring me back, Like his begetter, from the house of death.}
\par 

\par \textbf{MER. You talk of what I know not. I will go Shipward. May God be with you for all good.[Exit}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Is not this terrible, Laërtes’ son Should ever think to bring me with soft words And show me from his deck to all their host? No! Sooner will I listen to the tongue Of the curs’d basilisk that thus hath maim’d me. Ay, but he’ll venture anything in word Or deed. And now I know he will be here. Come, O my son, let us be gone, while seas And winds divide us from Odysseus’ ship. Let us depart. Sure timely haste brings rest And quiet slumber when the toil is done.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Shall we not sail when this south-western wind Hath fallen, that now is adverse to our course?}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. All winds are fair to him who flies from woe.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Nay, but this head-wind hinders them no less.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. No head-wind hinders pirates on their way, When violence and rapine lead them on.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Well, then, let us be going, if you will; [page 235][646-675] When you have taken from within the cave What most you need and value.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Though my all Be little, there is that I may not lose.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. What can there be that we have not on board?}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. A leaf I have found, wherewith I still the rage Of my sore plague, and lull it quite to rest.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Well, bring it forth.—What? Is there something more?}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. If any of these arrows here are fallen, I would not leave them for a casual prey.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. How? Do I see thee with the marvellous bow?}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Here in my hand. The world hath only one.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. And may one touch and handle it, and gaze With reverence, as on a thing from Heaven?}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Thou mayest, my son. This and whate’er of mine May stead thee, ’tis thy privilege to enjoy.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. In very truth I long for it, but so, That longing waits on leave. Am I permitted?}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Thou art, my son,—and well thou speakest,—thou art. Thou, that hast given me light and life, the joy Of seeing Mount Oeta and my father’s home, With all I love there, and his aged head,— Thou that hast raised me far above my foes Who triumphed! Thou may’st take it in thine hand, And,—when thou hast given it back to me,—may’st vaunt Alone of mortals for thine excellence To have held this in thy touch. I, too, at first, Received it as a boon for kindness done.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Well, go within.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Nay, I must take thee too. My sickness craves thee for its comforter. [PHILOCTETES and NEOPTOLEMUS go into the cave}

\par  CHORUS.

\par \textbf{In fable I have heard,I 1 Though sight hath ne’er confirmed the word, How he who attempted once the couch supreme, To a whirling wheel by Zeus the all-ruler bound, Tied head and heel, careering ever round, Atones his impious unsubstantial dream. Of no man else, through eye or ear, Have I discerned a fate more full of fear Than yonder sufferer’s of the cureless wound}
\par   Who did no violence, defrauded none: — A just man, had he dwelt among the just Unworthily behold him thrust Alone to hear the billows roar That break around a rugged shore! How could he live, whose life was thus consumed with moan?

\par \textbf{Where neighbour there was none}
\par  I 2 No arm to stay him wandering lone, Unevenly, with stumbling steps and sore; No friend in need, no kind inhabitant, To minister to his importunate want, No heart whereto his pangs he might deplore. None who, whene’er the gory flow Was rushing hot, might healing herbs bestow, Or cull from teeming Earth some genial plant To allay the anguish of malignant pain And soothe the sharpness of his poignant woe. Like infant whom the nurse lets go, With tottering movement here and there, He crawled for comfort, whensoe’er His soul-devouring plague relaxed its cruel strain.

\par \textbf{Not fed with foison of all-teeming EarthII 1 Whence we sustain us, ever-toiling men, But only now and then With wingèd things, by his wing’d shafts brought low, He stayed his hunger from his bow. [page 237][712-749] Poor soul, that never through ten years of dearth Had pleasure from the fruitage of the vine, But seeking to some standing pool, Nor clear nor cool, Foul water heaved to head for lack of heartening wine.}
\par 

\par \textbf{But now, consorted with the hero’s child,II 2 He winneth greatness and a joyful change; Over the water wild Borne by a friendly bark beneath the range Of Oeta, where Spercheius fills Wide channels winding among lovely hills Haunted of Melian nymphs, till he espies The roof-tree of his father’s hall, And high o’er all Shines the bronze shield of him, whose home is in the skies.

\par \textbf{NEO. O hapless one! Thrice hapless in thy manifold distress! What wilt thou? Shall I raise thee on mine arm?}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Nay, but receiving from my hand the bow, As late thou didst desire me, keep it safe And guard it, till the fury of my pain Pass over me and cease. For when ’tis spent, Slumber will seize me, else it ne’er would end. I must sleep undisturbed. But if meanwhile They come,—by Heaven I charge thee, in no wise, Willingly nor perforce, let them have this! Else thou wilt be the slayer of us both; Of me thy suppliant, and of thyself.}

\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Ah! but I fear, my son, thy prayer is vain}
\par   For welling yet again from depths within, This gory ooze is dripping. It will come! I know it will. O, foot, torn helpless thing, [page 239][786-816] What wilt thou do to me? Ah! ah! It comes, It is at hand. ’Tis here! Woe’s me, undone! I have shown you all. Stay near me. Go not far:  Ah! ah! O island king, I would this agony Might cleave thy bosom through and through! Woe, woe! Woe! Ah! ye two commanders of the host, Agamemnon, Menelaüs, O that ye, Another ten years’ durance in my room Might nurse this malady! O Death, Death, Death! I call thee daily—wilt thou never come? Will it not be?—My son, thou noble boy, If thou art noble, take and burn me there Aloft in yon all-worshipped Lemnian fire!

\par  CHORUS

\par \textbf{Lord of the happiest life,I Sleep, thou that know’st not strife, That know’st not grief, Still wafting sure relief, Come, saviour now! Thy healing balm is spread Over this pain worn head, Quench not the beam that gives calm to his brow.}

\par \textbf{Look, O my lord, to thy path, Either to go or to stay How is my thought to proceed? What is our cause for delay? Look! Opportunity’s power, Fitting the task to the hour, Giveth the race to the swift.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. He hears not. But I see that to have ta’en His bow without him were a bootless gain He must sail with us. So the god hath said Heaven hath decreed this garland for his head}
\par   And to have failed with falsehood were a meed Of shameful soilure for a shameless deed.

\par \textbf{CH. God shall determine the end—II But for thine answer, friend, Waft soft words low! All sick men’s sleep, we know, [page 241][848-879] Hath open eye; Their quickly ruffling mind Quivers in lightest wind, Sleepless in slumber new danger to spy.}
\par 

\par \textbf{Think, O my lord, of thy path, Secretly look forth afar, What wilt thou do for thy need? How with the wise wilt thou care? If toward the nameless thy heart Chooseth this merciful part, Huge are the dangers that drift.}
\par 

\par \textbf{The wind is fair, my son, the wind is fair, The man is dark and helpless, stretched in night. (O kind, warm sleep that calmest human care!) Powerless of hand and foot and ear and sight, Blind, as one lying in the house of death. (Think well if here thou utterest timely breath.) This, O my son, is all my thought can find, Best are the toils that without frightening bind.}

\par \textbf{NEO. Hush! One word more were madness. He revives. His eye hath motion. He uplifts his head.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Fair daylight following sleep, and ye, dear friends, Faithful beyond all hope in tending me! I never could have dreamed that thou, dear youth, Couldst thus have borne my sufferings and stood near So full of pity to relieve my pain. Not so the worthy generals of the host;— This princely patience was not theirs to show. Only thy noble nature, nobly sprung, Made light of all the trouble, though oppressed With fetid odours and unceasing cries. And now, since this my plague would seem to yield Some pause and brief forgetfulness of pain, With thine own hand, my son, upraise me here, And set me on my feet, that, when my strength [page 242][880-913] After exhaustion shall return again, We may move shoreward and launch forth with speed.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. I feel unhoped-for gladness when I see Thy painless gaze, and hear thy living breath, For thine appearance and surroundings both Were deathlike. But arise! Or, if thou wilt, These men shall raise thee. For they will not shrink From toil which thou and I at once enjoin.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Right, right, my son! But lift me thine own self, As I am sure thou meanest. Let these be, Lest they be burdened with the noisome smell Before the time. Enough for them to bear The trouble on board.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. I will; stand up, endure!}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Fear not. Old habit will enable me.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. O me! What shall I do? Now ’tis my turn to exclaim!}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. What canst thou mean? What change is here, my son?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. I know not how to shift the troublous word. ’Tis hopeless.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. What is hopeless? Speak not so, Dear child!}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. But so my wretched lot hath fallen.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Ah! Can it be, the offence of my disease Hath moved thee not to take me now on board?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. All is offence to one who hath forced himself From the true bent to an unbecoming deed.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Nought misbecoming to thyself or sire Doest thou or speak’st, befriending a good man.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. My baseness will appear. That wrings my soul.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Not in thy deeds. But for thy words, I fear me!}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. O Heaven! Must double vileness then be mine Both shameful silence and most shameful speech?}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Or my discernment is at fault, or thou Mean’st to betray me and make voyage without me.}

\par \textbf{NEO. Nay, not without thee, there is my distress! Lest I convey thee to thy bitter grief.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 243][914-946] PHI. How? How, dear youth? I do not understand.}

\par \textbf{NEO. Here I unveil it. Thou art to sail to Troy, To join the chieftains and the Achaean host.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. What do I hear? Ah!}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Grieve not till you learn.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Learn what? What wilt thou make of me? What mean’st thou?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. First to release thee from this plague, and then With thee to go and take the realm of Troy.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. And is this thine intent?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. ’Tis so ordained Unchangeably. Be not dismayed! ’Tis so.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Me miserable! I am betrayed, undone! What guile is here? My bow! give back my bow!}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. I may not. Interest, and duty too, Force me to obey commandment.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. O thou fire, Thou terror of the world! Dark instrument Of ever-hateful guile!—What hast thou done? How thou hast cheated me! Art not ashamed To look on him that sued to thee for shelter? O heart of stone, thou hast stolen my life away With yonder bow!—Ah, yet I beg of thee, Give it me back, my son, I entreat thee, give! By all thy father worshipped, rob me not Of life!—Ah me! Now he will speak no more, But turns away, obdúrate to retain it. O ye, my comrades in this wilderness, Rude creatures of the rocks, O promontories, Creeks, precipices of the hills, to you And your familiar presence I complain Of this foul trespass of Achilles’ son. Sworn to convey me home, to Troy he bears me. And under pledge of his right hand hath ta’en And holds from me perforce my wondrous bow, The sacred gift of Zeus-born Heracles, Thinking to wave it midst the Achaean host Triumphantly for his. In conquering me He vaunts as of some valorous feat, and knows not He is spoiling a mere corse, an empty dream, [page 244][947-980] The shadow of a vapour. In my strength He ne’er had vanquished me. Even as I am, He could not, but by guile. Now, all forlorn, I am abused, deceived. What must I do? Nay, give it me. Nay, yet be thy true self! Thou art silent. I am lost. O misery! Rude face of rock, back I return to thee And thy twin gateway, robbed of arms and food, To wither in thy cave companionless}
\par  — No more with these mine arrows to destroy Or flying bird or mountain-roving beast. But, all unhappy! I myself must be The feast of those on whom I fed, the chase Of that I hunted, and shall dearly pay In bloody quittance for their death, through one Who seemed all ignorant of sinful guile. Perish,—not till I am certain if thy heart Will change once more,—if not, my curse on thee!

\par \textbf{CH. What shall we do, my lord? We wait thy word Or to sail now, or yield to his desire.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. My heart is pressed with a strange pity for him, Not now beginning, but long since begun.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Ay, pity me, my son! by all above, Make not thy name a scorn by wronging me!}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. O! I am troubled sore. What must I do? Would I had never left mine island home!}

\par \textbf{OD. Yea. I deny it not. Be sure, ’twas I.}

\par \textbf{[page 245][981-1015] PHI. Give back, my son, the bow; release it!}

\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. They force me! O thou boldest of bad men! They force me?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. If thou com’st not willingly.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. O Lemnian earth and thou almighty flame, Hephaestos’ workmanship, shall this be borne, That he by force must drag me from your care?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. ’Tis Zeus, I tell thee, monarch of this isle, Who thus hath willed. I am his minister.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Wretch, what vile words thy wit hath power to say! The gods are liars when invoked by thee.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. Nay, ’tis their truth compels thee to this voyage.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. I will not have it so.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. I will. Thou shalt.}

\par \textbf{OD. (to the Attendants.) Ay, seize and bind him. Baffle him in this.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Poor hands, for lack of your beloved string, Caught by this craven! O corrupted soul! How thou hast undermined me, having taken To screen thy quest this youth to me unknown, Far worthier of my friendship than of thine, Who knew no better than to obey command. Even now ’tis manifest he burns within With pain for his own error and my wrong. But, though unwilling and mapt for ill, Thy crafty, mean, and cranny spying soul Too well hath lessoned him in sinful lore. [page 246][1016-1052] Now thou hast bound me, O thou wretch, and thinkest To take me from this coast, where thou didst cast me Outlawed and desolate, a corpse ’mongst men. Oh! I curse thee now, as ofttimes in the past}
\par   But since Heaven yields me nought but bitterness, Thou livest and art blithe, while ’tis my pain To live on in my misery, laughed to scorn By thee and Atreus’ sons, those generals twain Whom thou art serving in this chase. But thou With strong compulsion and deceit was driven Troyward, whilst I, poor victim, of free will Took my seven ships and sailed there, yet was thrown Far from all honour,—as thou sayest, by them, But, as they turn the tale, by thee.—And now Why fetch me hence and take me? To what end? I am nothing, dead to you this many a year. How, O thou Heaven-abhorred! am I not now Lame and of evil smell? how shall ye vaunt Before the gods drink-offering or the fat Of victims, if I sail among your crew? For this, as ye professed, was the chief cause Why ye disowned me. Perish!—So ye shall, For the wrong done me, if the Heavens be just. And that they are, I know. Else had ye ne’er Sailed on this errand for an outcast wretch, Had they not pricked your heart with thoughts of me. Oh, if ye pity me, chastising powers, And thou, the Genius of my land, revenge, Revenge this crime on all their heads at once! My life is pitiable; but if I saw Their ruin, I would think me well and strong.

\par \textbf{CH. How full of bitterness is his resolve, Wrathfully spoken with unbending will!}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. I might speak long in answer, did the time Give scope, but now one thing is mine to say. I am known to vary with the varying need; And when ’tis tried, who can be just and good, My peer will not be found for piety. But though on all occasions covetous [page 247][1053-1092] Of victory, this once I yield to thee, And willingly. Unhand him there. Let go! Leave him to stay. What further use of thee, When we have ta’en these arms? Have we not Teucer, Skilled in this mystery? Yea, I may boast Myself thine equal both in strength and aim To wield them. Fare thee well, then! Thou art free To roam thy barren isle. We need thee not. Let us be going! And perchance thy gift May bring thy destined glory to my brow.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. What shall I do? Alas, shalt thou be seen Graced with mine arms amongst Achaean men?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. No more! I am going.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. O Achilles’ child! Wilt thou, too, vanish? Must I lose thy voice?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OD. Come on, and look not, noble though thou be, Lest thou undo our fortune.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Mariners, Must ye, too, leave me thus disconsolate? Will ye not pity me?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Our captain’s here. Whate’er he saith to thee, that we too speak.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. My chief will call me weakling, soft of heart; But go not yet, since our friend bids you stay. Till we have prayed, and all be ready on board. Meanwhile, perchance, he may conceive some thought That favours our design. We two will start; And ye, be swift to speed forth at our call.[Exit}

How I seem fated never more to range From thy sad covert, that hath felt the shock Of pain on pain, steeped with my wretchedness. Now thou wilt be my comforter in death! Grief haunted harbour, choked with my distress! Tell me, what hope is mine of daily food, Who will be careful for my good? [page 248][1093-1132] I fail. Ye cowering creatures of the sky, Oh, as ye fly, Snatch me, borne upward on the blast’s sharp breath!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. 1. Thou child of misery! No mightier power hath this decreed, But thine own will and deed Hath bound thee thus in grief, Since, when kind Heaven had sent relief And shown the path of wisdom firm and sure, Thou still hast chosen this evil to endure.}

O hapless life, sore bruised with pain!I 2 No more with living mortal may I dwell, But ever pining in this desert cell With lonely grief, all famished must remain And perish; for what food is mine to share, When this strong arm no longer wields my bow, Whose fleet shafts flew to smite the birds of air I was o’erthrown by words, words dark and blind, Low-creeping from a traitorous mind! O might I see him, whose unrighteous thought This ruin wrought, Plagued for no less a period with like woe!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. 2. Not by our craft thou art caught, But Destiny divine hath wrought The net that holds thee bound. Aim not at us the sound Of thy dread curse with dire disaster fraught. On others let that light! ’Tis our true care Thou should’st not scorn our love in thy despair.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Now, seated by the shoreII 1 Of heaving ocean hoar, He mocks me, waving high The sole support of my precarious being, The bow which none e’er held but I. O treasure of my heart, torn from this hand, That loved thy touch,—if thou canst understand, How sad must be thy look in seeing Thy master destined now no more, Like Heracles of yore, [page 249][1133-1168] To wield thee with an archer’s might! But in the grasp of an all-scheming wight, O bitter change! thou art plied; And swaying ever by his side, Shalt view his life of dark malignity, Teeming with guileful shames, like those he wrought on me.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. 3. Nobly to speak for the right Is manly and strong; But not with an envious blight To envenom the tongue; He to serve all his friends of the fleet, One obeying a many-voiced word, Through the minist’ring craft of our lord Hath but done what was meet.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Come, legions of the wild,II 2 Of aspect fierce or mild, Fowl from the fields of air, And beasts that roam with bright untroubled gaze, No longer bounding from my lair Fly mine approach! Now freely without fear Ye may surround my covert and come near, Treading the savage rock-strewn ways. The might I had is no more mine, Stolen with those arms divine. This fort hath no man to defend. Come satisfy your vengeful jaws, and rend These quivering tainted limbs! Already hovering death bedims My fainting sense. Who thus can live on air, Tasting no gift of earth that breathing mortals share?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. 4. Ah! do not shrink from thy friend, If love thou reverest, But know ’tis for thee to forfend The fate which thou fearest. The lot thou hast here to deplore, Is sad evermore to maintain, [page 250][1169-1202] And hardship in sickness is sore, But sorest in pain.}

\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Never, learn it once for all! Not though he, whom Heaven obeys, Blast me with fierce lightning’s blaze!

Ah, but, strangers, if your sense [page 251][1203-1233] Hath o’er-mastered this offence, Yield but one thing to my prayer!}

And thou art restive grown, and wilt not hearken, But though one counsel thee with kind’st intent, Wilt take him for a dark malignant foe. Yet, calling Zeus to witness for my soul, Once more I will speak. Know this, and mark it well}
\par   Thou bear’st this sickness by a heavenly doom, Through coming near to Chrysa’s sentinel, The lurking snake, that guards the sky-roofed fold. And from this plague thou ne’er shall find reprieve [page 255][1330-1368] While the same Sun god rears him from the east And droops to west again, till thou be come Of thine own willing mind to Troia’s plain, Where our physicians, sons of Phoebus’ child, Shall soothe thee from thy sore, and thou with me And with this bow shalt take Troy’s citadel. How do I know this? I will tell thee straight We have a Trojan captive, Helenus, Both prince and prophet, who hath clearly told This must be so, yea, and ere harvest time This year, great Troy must fall, else if his words Be falsified, who will may slay the seer. Now, since thou know’st of this, yield thy consent; For glorious is the gain, being singled forth From all the Greeks as noblest, first to come To healing hands, and then to win renown Unrivalled, vanquishing all tearful Troy.

\par \textbf{PHI. Oh how I hate my life! Why must it keep This breathing form from sinking to the shades? How can I prove a rebel to his mind Who thus exhorts me with affectionate heart? And yet, oh misery! must I give way? Then how could I endure the light of heaven? With whom could I exchange a word? Ay me! Eyes that have seen each act of my sad life, How could ye bear it, to behold the sons Of Atreus, my destroyers, comrades now And friends! Laërtes’ wicked son, my friend! And less I feel the grief of former wrong Than shudder with expectance of fresh harm They yet may work on me. For when the mind Hath once been mother of an evil brood, It nurses nought but evils. Yea, at thee I marvel. Thou should’st ne’er return to Troy, Nor suffer me to go, when thou remember’st What insult they have done thee, ravishing Thy father’s rights from thee. And wilt thou then Sail to befriend them, pressing me in aid? Nay, do not, son; but, even as thou hast sworn, Convey me home, and thou, in Scyros dwelling, [page 256][1369-1402] Leave to their evil doom those evil men. So thou shalt win a twofold gratitude From me and from my father, and not seem, Helping vile men, to be as vile as they.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. ’Tis fairly spoken. Yet I would that thou Relying on my word and on Heaven’s aid, Would’st voyage forth from Lemnos with thy friend.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Mean’st thou to Troy, and to the hateful sons Of Atreus, me, with this distressful limb?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Nay, but to those that will relieve the pain Of thy torn foot and heal thee of thy plague.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Thy words are horrible. What mean’st thou, boy?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. The act I deem the noblest for us both.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Wilt thou speak so? Where is thy fear of Heaven?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Why should I fear, when I see certain gain?}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Gain for the sons of Atreus, or for me?}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Methinks a friend should give thee friendly counsel.}

\par \textbf{PHI. Friendly, to hand me over to my foes?}

\par \textbf{NEO. Ah, be not hardened in thy misery!}

\par \textbf{PHI. I know thou wilt ruin me by what thou speakest.}

\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. I know the Atreidae cast me on this rock.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. But how, if they should save thee afterward?}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. They ne’er shall make me see Troy with my will.}
\par 

\par \textbf{NEO. Hard is my fortune, then, if by no sleight Of reasoning I can draw thee to my mind. For me, ’twere easiest to end speech, that thou Might’st live on as thou livest in hopeless pain.}
\par 

\par \textbf{PHI. Then leave me to my fate!—But thou hast touched My right hand with thine own, and given consent To bear me to my home. Do this, dear son! And do not linger to take thought of Troy. Enough that name hath echoed in my groans.}

\par \textbf{HERACLES. First, son of Poeas, wait till thou hast heard The voice of Heracles, and weighed his word.

Then hear me, first how after my long toils By strange adventure I have found and won Immortal glory, which thine eyes perceive; And the like lot, I tell thee, shall be thine, After these pains to rise to glorious fame. Sailing with this thy comrade to Troy-town, First thou shalt heal thee from thy grievous sore, And then, being singled forth from all the host As noblest, thou shalt conquer with that bow Paris, prime author of these years of harm, And capture Troy, and bear back to thy hall The choicest guerdon, for thy valour’s meed, To Oeta’s vale and thine own father’s home. But every prize thou tak’st be sure thou bear Unto my pyre, in memory of my bow. This word, Achilles’ offspring, is for thee No less. For, as thou could’st not without him, So, without thee, he cannot conquer Troy. Then, like twin lions hunting the same hill, [page 258][1437-1471] Guard thou him, and he thee! and I will send Asclepius Troyward to relieve thy pain. For Ilion now a second time must fall Before the Herculean bow. But, take good heed, Midst all your spoil to hold the gods in awe. For our great Father counteth piety Far above all. This follows men in death, And fails them not when they resign their breath.}

\par \textbf{PHI. Come, let me bless the region ere I go. Poor house, sad comrade of my watch, farewell! Ye nymphs of meadows where soft waters flow Thou ocean headland, pealing thy deep knell, Where oft within my cavern as I lay My hair was moist with dashing south-wind’s spray, And ofttimes came from Hermes’ foreland high Sad replication of my storm-vext cry; Ye fountains and thou Lycian water sweet,— I never thought to leave you, yet my feet Are turning from your paths,—we part for aye. Farewell! and waft me kindly on my way, O Lemnian earth enclosed by circling seas, To sail, where mighty Fate my course decrees, And friendly voices point me, and the will Of that heroic power, who doth this act fulfil.}

\par \textbf{CH. Come now all in one strong band; Then, ere loosing from the land, Pray we to the nymphs of sea Kind protectresses to be, Till we touch the Trojan strand.}

\section{OEDIPUS AT COLONOS}\section{THE PERSONS} 
\par  [page 260] Oedipus had remained at Thebes for some time after his fall. But he was afterwards banished by the command of Creon, with the consent of his own sons. Their intention at first was to lay no claim to the throne. But by-and-by ambition prevailed with Eteocles, the younger-born, and he persuaded Creon and the citizens to banish his elder brother. Polynices took refuge at Argos, where he married the daughter of Adrastus, and levied an army of auxiliaries to support his pretensions to the throne of Thebes. Before going into exile Oedipus had cursed his sons.

\par  Antigone after a while fled forth to join her father and support him in his wanderings. Ismenè also once brought him secret intelligence.

\par  Years have now elapsed, and the Delphian oracle proclaims that if Oedipus dies in a foreign land the enemies of Thebes shall overcome her.

\par  In ignorance of this fact, Oedipus, now aged as well as blind, and led by his daughter Antigone, appears before the grove of the Eumenides, at Colonos, in the neighbourhood of Athens. He has felt an inward intimation, which is strengthened by some words of the oracle received by him long since at Delphi, that his involuntary crimes have been atoned for, and that the Avenging Deities will now receive him kindly and make his cause their own.

\par  After some natural hesitation on the part of the village-councillors of Colonos, Oedipus is received with princely magnanimity by Theseus, who takes him under the protection of Athens, and defends him against the machinations of Creon.

\par  Thus the blessing of the Gods, which Oedipus carried with him, is secured to Athens, and denied to Thebes. The craft of Creon and the prayers of Polynices alike prove unavailing. Then the man of many sorrows, whose essential nobleness has survived them all, passes away mysteriously from the sight of men.

\par  The scene is laid at Colonos, a suburb of Athens much frequented by the upper classes, especially the Knights (see Thuc. viii. 67); and before the sacred grove of the Eumenides, or Gentle Goddesses, a euphemistic title for the Erinyes, or Goddesses of Vengeance.

\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Be silent now. There comes an aged band With jealous looks to know thine errand here.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. I will be silent, and thine arm shall guide My footstep under covert of the grove Out of the path, till I make sure what words These men will utter. Warily to observe Is the prime secret of the prudent mind.[Exeunt}
\par 

\par  CHORUS (entering).

\par \textbf{Keep watch! Who is it? Look!1 Where is he? Vanished! Gone! Oh where? Most uncontrolled of men! Look well, inquire him out, Search keenly in every nook! —Some wanderer is the aged wight, A wanderer surely, not a native here. Else never had he gone within The untrodden grove Of these—unmarried, unapproachable in might, —Whose name we dare not breathe, But pass their shrine Without a look, without a word, Uttering the unheard voice of reverential thought. But now, one comes, they tell, devoid of awe, Whom, peering all around this grove I find not, where he abideth.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 265][138-177] OED. (behind). Behold me! For I ‘see by sound,’ As mortals say.}

\par \textbf{CH. Oh, Oh! With horror I see him, with horror hear him speak.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Pray you, regard me not as a transgressor!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Defend us, Zeus! Who is that aged wight?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Not one of happiest fate, Or enviable, O guardians of this land! ’Tis manifest; else had I not come hither Led by another’s eyes, not moored my bark On such a slender stay.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Alas! And are thine eyes2 Sightless? O full of misery, As thou look’st full of years! But not, if I prevail, Shalt thou bring down this curse. Thou art trespassing. Yet keep thy foot From stumbling in that verdant, voiceless dell, Where running water as it fills The hallowed bowl, Mingles with draughts of honey. Stranger, hapless one! Avoid that with all care. Away! Remove! Distance impedes the sound. Dost hear, Woe-burdened wanderer? If aught thou carest to bring Before our council, leave forbidden ground, And there, where all have liberty, Speak,—but till then, avaunt thee!}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Daughter, what must I think, or do?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. My sire! We must conform us to the people’s will, Yielding ere they compel.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Give me thy hand.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Thou hast it.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. —Strangers, let me not Be wronged, when I have trusted you And come from where I stood!}

\par 

\par \textbf{[page 266][178-211] OED. Farther?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Advance thy foot.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Yet more?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Assist him onward Maiden, thou hast thy sight.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Come, follow, this way follow with thy darkened steps, Father, the way I am leading thee.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Content thee, sojourning in a strange land, O man of woe! To eschew whate’er the city holds in hate, And honour what she loves!}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Then do thou lead me, child, Where with our feet secure from sin We may be suffered both to speak and hear. Let us not war against necessity.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. There! From that bench of rock Go not again astray.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Even here?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Enough, I tell thee.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. May I sit?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Ay, crouch thee low adown Crooking thy limbs, upon the stone.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Father, this task is mine— Sink gently down into thy resting-place,}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Woe is me!}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Supporting on this loving hand Thy reverend aged form.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Woe, for my cruel fate![OEDIPUS is seated}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Now thou unbendest from thy stubborn ways, O man of woe! Declare, what mortal wight thou art, That, marked by troublous fortune, here art led. What native country, shall we learn, is thine?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. O strangers, I have none! But do not—}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. What dost thou forbid, old sir?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Do not, oh, do not ask me who I am, Nor probe me with more question.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 267][212-244] CH. What dost thou mean?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. My birth is dreadful.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Tell it forth.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. What should I utter, O my child? Woe is me!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Thy seed, thy father’s name, stranger, pronounce!}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Alas! What must I do? My child!}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Since no resource avails thee, speak!}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. I will. I cannot hide it further.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Ye are long about it. Haste thee!}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Know ye of one Begotten of Laius?}
\par

\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Oh!}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Daughter, what is coming?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Away! Go forth. Leave ye the land. Begone!}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. And where, then, is the promise thou hast given?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. No doom retributive attends the deed That wreaks prevenient wrong. Deceit, matched with deceit, makes recompense Of evil, not of kindness. Get thee forth! Desert that seat again, and from this land Unmooring speed thee away, lest on our state Thou bring some further bale!}
\par 

\par  MONODY.

\par \textbf{ANT. O strangers, full of reverent care! Since ye cannot endure my father here, Aged and blind, Because ye have heard a rumour of the deeds He did unknowingly,—yet, we entreat you. Strangers, have pity on me, the hapless girl, Who pray for mine own sire and for none else, —Pray, looking in your eyes with eyes not blind. [page 268][245-282] As if a daughter had appeared to you. Pleading for mercy to the unfortunate. We are in your hands as in the hand of God, Helpless. O then accord the unhoped for boon! By what is dear to thee, thy veriest own, I pray thee,—chattel or child, or holier name! Search through the world, thou wilt not find the man Who could resist the leading of a God.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Daughter of Oedipus, be well assured We view with pity both thy case and his, But fear of Heavenly wrath confines our speech To that we have already said to you.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. What profit lives in fame and fair renown By unsubstantial rumour idly spread? When Athens is extolled with peerless praise For reverence, and for mercy!—She alone The sufferer’s shield, the exile’s comforter! What have I reaped hereof? Ye have raised me up From yonder seat, and now would drive me forth Fearing a name! For there is nought in me Or deeds of mine to make you fear. My life Hath more of wrong endured than of wrong done, Were it but lawful to disclose to you Wherefore ye dread me,—not my sin but theirs, My mother’s and my sire’s. I know your thought. Yet never can ye fasten guilt on me, Who, though I had acted with the clear’st intent, Were guiltless, for my deed requited wrong. But as it was, all blindly I went forth On that dire road, while they who planned my death Planned it with perfect knowledge. Therefore, sirs, By Heaven I pray you, as ye have bid me rise, Protect your suppliant without fail; and do not In jealous reverence for the blessed Gods Rob them of truest reverence, but know this}
\par  — God looks upon the righteousness of men And their unrighteousness, nor ever yet Hath one escaped who wrought iniquity. Take part, then, with the Gods, nor overcloud [page 269][283-316] The golden fame of Athens with dark deeds; But as ye have pledged your faith to shelter me, Defend me and rescue, not rejecting me Through mere abhorrence of my ruined face. For on a holy mission am I come, Sent with rich blessings for your neighbours here. And when the head and sovereign of your folk Is present, ye shall learn the truth at full. Till then, be gracious to me, and not perverse.

\par \textbf{CH. Thy meaning needs must strike our hearts with awe, Old wanderer! so weighty are the words That body it forth. Therefore we are content The Lord of Athens shall decide this case.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. And where is he who rules this country, sirs?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. He keeps his father’s citadel. But one Is gone to fetch him, he who brought us hither.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Think you he will consider the blind man, And come in person here to visit him?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Be sure he will,—when he hath heard thy name.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. And who will carry that?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. ’Tis a long road; But rumour from the lips of wayfarers Flies far and wide, so that he needs must hear; And hearing, never doubt but he will come. So noised in every land hath been thy name, Old sovereign,—were he sunk in drowsiness, That sound would bring him swiftly to thy side.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Well, may he come to bless his city and me! When hath not goodness blessed the giver of good?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. O Heavens! What shall I say, what think, my father?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Daughter Antigone, what is it?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. I see A woman coming toward us, mounted well On a fair Sicilian palfrey, and her face With brow-defending hood of Thessaly Is shadowed from the sun. What must I think? Is it she or no? Can the eye so far deceive? [page 270][317-346] It is. ’Tis not. Unhappy that I am, I know not.—Yes, ’tis she. For drawing near She greets me with bright glances, and declares Beyond a doubt, Ismene’s self is here.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. What say’st thou, daughter?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. That I see thy child, My sister. Soon her voice will make thee sure.}
\par 

\par  Enter ISMENE.

\par \textbf{ISMENE. Father and sister!—names for ever dear! Hard hath it been to find you, yea, and hard I feel it now to look on you for grief.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Child, art thou here?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Father! O sight of pain!}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Offspring and sister!}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Woe for thy dark fate!}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Hast thou come, daughter?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. On a troublous way.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Touch me, my child!}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. I give a hand to both.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. To her and me?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Three linked in one sad knot.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Child, wherefore art thou come?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. In care for thee.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Because you missed me?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Ay, and to bring thee tidings, With the only slave whom I could trust.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. And they, Thy brethren, what of them? Were they not there To take this journey for their father’s good?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Ask not of them. Dire deeds are theirs to day.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. How in all points their life obeys the law Of Egypt, where the men keep house and weave Sitting within doors, while the wives abroad Provide with ceaseless toil the means of life. So in your case, my daughters, they who should Have ta’en this burden on them, bide at home Like maidens, while ye take their place, and lighten My miseries by your toil. Antigone, E’er since her childhood ended, and her frame [page 271][347-387] Was firmly knit, with ceaseless ministry Still tends upon the old man’s wandering, Oft in the forest ranging up and down Fasting and barefoot through the burning heat Or pelting rain, nor thinks, unhappy maid, Of home or comfort, so her father’s need Be satisfied. And thou, that camest before, Eluding the Cadmeans, and didst tell me What words Apollo had pronounced on me. And when they banished me, stood’st firm to shield me, What news, Ismene, bring’st thou to thy sire To day? What mission sped thee forth? I know Thou com’st not idly, but with fears for me.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Father, I will not say what I endured In searching out the place that sheltered thee. To tell it o’er would but renew the pain. But of the danger now encompassing Thine ill starred sons,—of that I came to speak. At first they strove with Creon and declared The throne should be left vacant and the town Freed from pollution,—paying deep regard In their debate to the dark heritage Of ruin that o’ershadowed all thy race. Far different is the strife which holds them now, Since some great Power, joined to their sinful mind, Incites them both to seize on sovereign sway. Eteocles, in pride of younger years, Robbed elder Polynices of his right, Dethroned and banished him. To Argos then Goes exiled Polynices, and obtains Through intermarriage a strong favouring league, Whose word is, ‘Either Argos vanquishes The seed of Cadmus or exalts their fame’ This, father, is no tissue of empty talk, But dreadful truth, nor can I tell where Heaven Is to reveal his mercy to thy woe.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. And hadst thou ever hoped the Gods would care For mine affliction, and restore my life?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. I hope it now since this last oracle.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 272][388-417] OED. What oracle hath been declared, my child?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. That they shall seek thee forth, alive or dead, To bring salvation to the Theban race.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Who can win safety through such help as mine?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. ’Tis said their victory depends on thee.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. When shrunk to nothing, am I indeed a man?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Yea, for the Gods uphold thee, who then destroyed.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Poor work, to uphold in age who falls when young!}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Know howsoe’er that Creon will be here For this same end, ere many an hour be spent.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. For what end, daughter? Tell me in plain speech.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. To set thee near their land, that thou may’st be Beyond their borders, but within their power.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. What good am I, thus lying at their gate?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Thine inauspicious burial brings them woe.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. There needs no oracle to tell one that.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. And therefore they would place thee near their land, Where thou may’st have no power upon thyself.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Say then, shall Theban dust o’ershadow me?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. The blood of kindred cleaving to thy hand, Father, forbids thee.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Never, then, henceforth, Shall they lay hold on me!}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. If that be true, The brood of Cadmus shall have bale.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. What cause Having appeared, will bring this doom to pass?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Thy wrath, when they are marshalled at thy tomb.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. From whom hast thou heard this?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Sworn messengers Brought such report from Delphi’s holy shrine.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Hath Phoebus so pronounced my destiny?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. So they declare who brought the answer back.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Did my sons hear?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. They know it, both of them.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 273][418-450] OED. Villains, who, being informed of such a word, Turned not their thoughts toward me, but rather chose Ambition and a throne!}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. It wounds mine ear To hear it spoken, but the news I bring Is to that stern effect.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Then I pray Heaven The fury of their fate-appointed strife May ne’er be quenched, but that the end may come According to my wish upon them twain To this contention and arbitrament Of battle which they now assay and lift The threatening spear! So neither he who wields The sceptred power should keep possession still, Nor should his brother out of banishment Ever return}
\par  —who, when their sire—when I Was shamefully thrust from my native land, Checked not my fall nor saved me, but, for them, I was driven homeless and proclaimed an exile. Ye will tell me ’twas in reason that the State Granted this boon to my express desire. Nay; for in those first hours of agony, When my heart raged, and it seemed sweetest to me To die the death, and to be stoned with stones, No help appeared to yield me that relief. But after lapse of days, when all my pain Was softened, and I felt that my hot spirit Had run to fierce excess of bitterness In wreaking mine offence—then, then the State Drove me for ever from the land, and they, Their father’s sons, who might have saved their father, Cared not to help him, but betrayed by them, For lack of one light word, I wandered forth To homeless banishment and beggary. But these weak maidens to their nature’s power Have striven to furnish me with means to live And dwell securely, girded round with love. My sons have chosen before their father’s life A lordly throne and sceptred sovereignty. But never shall they win me to their aid, [page 274][451-481] Nor shall the Theban throne for which they strive Bring them desired content. That well I know, Comparing with my daughter’s prophecies Those ancient oracles which Phoebus once Spake in mine ear. Then let them send to seek me Creon, or who is strongest in their State. For if ye, strangers, will but add your might To the protection of these awful Powers, The guardians of your soil, to shelter me, Ye shall acquire for this your State a saviour Mighty to save, and ye shall vex my foes.

\par \textbf{CH. Thou art worthy of all compassion, Oedipus, Thyself and these thy daughters. Now, moreover Since thou proclaim’st thyself our country’s saviour I would advise thee for the best.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Kind sir, Be my good guide. I will do all thou biddest.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Propitiate then these holy powers, whose grove Received thee when first treading this their ground.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. What are the appointed forms? Advise me, sirs.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. First see to it that from some perennial fount Clean hands provide a pure drink-offering.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. And when I have gotten this unpolluted draught?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. You will find bowls, formed by a skilful hand, Whose brims and handles you must duly wreathe.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. With leaves or flocks of wool, or in what way?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. With tender wool ta’en from a young ewe-lamb.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Well, and what follows to complete the rite?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Next, make libation toward the earliest dawn.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Mean’st thou from those same urns whereof thou speakest?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. From those three vessels pour three several streams, Filling the last to the brim.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. With what contents Must this be filled? Instruct me.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Not with wine, But water and the treasure of the bee.}
\par 

\par \textbf{[page 275][482-513] OED. And when leaf-shadowed Earth has drunk of this, What follows?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Thou shalt lay upon her then From both thy hands a row of olive-twigs— Counting thrice nine in all—and add this prayer—}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. That is the chief thing,—that I long to hear.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. As we have named them Gentle, so may they From gentle hearts accord their suppliant aid;— Be this thy prayer, or whoso prays for thee, Spoken not aloud, but so that none may hear; And in departing, turn not. This being done, I can stand by thee without dread. But else, I needs must fear concerning thee.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. My daughters, Have ye both heard our friends who inhabit here?}
\par 

\par \textbf{ANT. Yea, father; and we wait for thy command.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. I cannot go. Two losses hinder me, Two evils, want of strength and want of sight. Let one of you go and perform this service. One soul, methinks, in paying such a debt May quit a million, if the heart be pure. Haste, then, to do it. Only leave me not Untended. For I cannot move alone Nor without some one to support me and guide.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. I will be ministrant. But let me know Where I must find the place of offering.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Beyond this grove. And, stranger maid, if aught Seem wanting, there is one at hand to show it.}
\par 

\par \textbf{ISM. Then to my task. Meantime, Antigone, Watch by our sire. We must not make account Of labour that supplies a parent’s need.[Exit}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Thy long since slumbering woe I would not wake again,I 1 But yet I long to learn.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. What hidden lore?}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. The pain [page 276][514-541] That sprang against thy life with spirit-mastering force.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Ah, sirs, as ye are kind, re-open not that source Of unavoided shame.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Friend, we would hear the tale Told truly, whose wide voice doth hourly more prevail.}

\par \textbf{OED. Misery!}

\par 

\par \textbf{OED. O bitterness!}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Consent. For all thou didst require we gave to thy content.}

\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Whence? We would understand.}
\par

\par 

\par  Enter THESEUS.

\par \textbf{THESEUS. From many voices in the former time Telling thy cruel tale of sight destroyed I have known thee, son of Laius, and to-day I know thee anew, in learning thou art here. Thy raiment, and the sad change in thy face, Proclaim thee who thou art, and pitying thee, Dark-fated Oedipus, I fain would hear What prayer or supplication thou preferrest To me and to my city, thou and this Poor maid who moves beside thee. Full of dread Must be that fortune thou canst name, which I Would shrink from, since I know of mine own youth, How in strange lands a stranger as thou art I bore the brunt of perilous circumstance Beyond all others; nor shall any man, Like thee an alien from his native home, Find me to turn my face from succouring him. I am a man and know it. To-morrow’s good Is no more mine than thine or any man’s.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Thy noble spirit, Theseus, in few words Hath made my task of utterance brief indeed. Thou hast told aright my name and parentage And native city. Nought remains for me [page 278][573-598] But to make known mine errand, and our talk Is ended.}

\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Here is my distress}
\par  — [page 279][599-633] I am made an outcast from my native land By mine own offspring. And return is barred For ever to the man who slew his sire.

\par \textbf{THE. How then should they require thee to go near, And yet dwell separate?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. The voice of Heaven Will drive them to it.}

\par \textbf{OED. Destined defeat By Athens in the Athenian land.}
\par 

\par \textbf{THE. What source Of bitterness ’twixt us and Thebes can rise?}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Dear son of Aegeus, to the Gods alone Comes never Age nor Death. All else i’ the world Time, the all subduer, merges in oblivion. Earth and men’s bodies weaken, fail, and perish. Faith withers, breach of faith springs up and glows And neither men nor cities that are friends Breathe the same spirit with continuing breath. Love shall be turned to hate, and hate to love With many hereafter, as with some to-day. And though, this hour, between great Thebes and thee No cloud be in the heaven, yet moving Time Enfolds a countless brood of days to come, Wherein for a light cause they shall destroy Your now harmonious league with severing war, Even where my slumbering form, buried in death, Coldly shall drink the life blood of my foes, If Zeus be Zeus, and his son Phoebus true. I would not speak aloud of mysteries. Then let me leave where I began. Preserve Thine own good faith, and thou shalt never say, Unless Heaven’s promise fail me, that for nought Athens took Oedipus to dwell with her.}

\par 

\par \textbf{THE. I know that none shall force Thee from this ground against thy will. Full oft Have threatening words in wrath been voluble, Yet, when the mind regained her place again, The threatened evil vanished. So to-day Bold words of boastful meaning have proclaimed Thy forcible abduction by thy kin. Yet shall they find (I know it) the voyage from Thebes, On such a quest, long and scarce navigable.

But I am sent to bring By fair persuasion to our Theban plain The reverend form of him now present here. Nor came this mission from one single will, But the commands of all my citizens Are on me, seeing that it becomes my birth To mourn his sorrows most of all the state [page 283][740-774] Thou, then, poor sufferer, lend thine ear to me And come. All Cadmus’ people rightfully Invite thee with one voice unto thy home, I before all,—since I were worst of men, Were I not pained at thy misfortunes, sir, —To see thee wandering in the stranger’s land Aged and miserable, unhoused, unfed, Singly attended by this girl, whose fall To such a depth of undeservèd woe I could not have imagined! Hapless maid! Evermore caring for thy poor blind head, Roving in beggary, so young, with no man To marry her,—a mark for all mischance. O misery, what deep reproach I have laid On thee and me and our whole ill-starred race! But who can hide evil that courts the day? Thou, therefore, Oedipus, without constraint, (By all the Gods of Cadmus’ race I pray thee) Remove this horror from the sight of men By coming to the ancestral city and home Of thy great sires,—bidding a kind farewell To worthiest Athens, as is meet.

Beforetime, when my self-procurèd woes Were plaguing me, and I would fain have rushed To instant banishment, thou wouldst not then Grant this indulgence to my keen desire. But when I had fed my passion to the full, And all my pleasure was to live at home, Then ’twas thy cue to expel and banish me, Nor was this name of kindred then so dear. Now once again, when thou behold’st this city And people joined in friendly bands with me, Thou wouldst drag me from my promised resting-place, Hiding hard policy with courtly show.

Even such a gift thou profferest me to-day, Kind in pretence, but really full of evil. These men shall hear me tell thy wickedness. Thou comest to take me, not unto my home, But to dwell outlawed at your gate, that so Your Thebè may come off untouched of harm From her encounter with Athenian men. Ye shall not have me thus. But you shall have My vengeful spirit ever in your land Abiding for destruction,—and my sons Shall have this portion in their father’s ground, To die thereon. Know I not things in Thebes Better than thou? Yea, for ’tis mine to hear Safer intelligencers,—Zeus himself, And Phoebus, high interpreter of Heaven. Thou bring’st a tongue suborned with false pretence, Sharpened with insolence;—but in shrewd speech Thou shalt find less of profit than of bane. This thou wilt ne’er believe. Therefore begone!

\par \textbf{THE. Then one of you run to the altar-foot Hard by, and haste the people from the rite, Horsemen and footmen at the height of speed To race unto the parting of the roads Where travellers from both gorges wont to meet. Lest there the maidens pass beyond our reach And I be worsted by this stranger’s might And let him laugh at me. Be swift! Away! —For him, were I as wroth as he deserves, He should not go unpunished from my hand. But now he shall be ruled by the same law He thought to enforce. Thou goest not from this ground Till thou hast set these maids in presence here; Since by thine act thou hast disgraced both me And thine own lineage and thy native land, Who with unlicensed inroad hast assailed An ancient city, that hath still observed Justice and equity, and apart from law Ratifies nothing; and, being here, hast cast Authority to the winds, and made thine own Whate’er thou wouldst, bearing it off perforce,— Deeming of me forsooth as nothing worth, And of my city as one enslaved to foes [page 289][917-955] Or void of manhood. Not of Thebe’s will Come such wild courses. It is not her way To foster men in sin, nor would she praise Thy doing, if she knew that thou hast robbed Me and the gods, dragging poor suppliant wights From their last refuge at thy will—I would not, Had I perchance set foot within thy land, Even were my cause most righteous, have presumed, Without consent of him who bore chief sway, To seize on any man, but would have known How men should act who tread on foreign soil. Thou bring’st disgrace on thine own mother state All undeservedly, and the lapse of years Hath left thee aged, but not wise—Again I bid those maids now to be brought with speed, Unless thou would’st be made a sojourner In Athens by compulsion. This I speak Not with my lips alone, but from my will.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Stranger, dost thou perceive? Thy parentage Is owned as noble, but thine evil deeds Are blazoned visibly.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CR. Great Aegeus’ son! Not as misprising this thy city’s strength In arms, or wisdom in debate, I dared This capture, but in simple confidence Thy citizens would not so envy me My blood relations, as to harbour them Against my will,—nor welcome to their hearths A man incestuous and a parricide, The proved defiler of his mother’s bed Such was the mount of Ares that I knew, Seat of high wisdom, planted in their soil, That suffers no such lawless runaways To haunt within the borders of your realm. Relying on that I laid my hands upon This quarry, nor had done so, were it not That bitterly he cursed myself and mine. That moved me to requital, since even Age Still bears resentment, till the power of death Frees men from anger, as from all annoy. [page 290][956-993] Being sovereign here thou wilt do thy pleasure. I, Though I have justice on my side, am weak Through being alone. Yet if you meddle with me, Old as I am, you’ll find me dangerous.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. O boldness void of shame! Whom dost thou think Thy obloquy most harms, this agèd head Or thine, who hast thus let pass thy lips the crimes I have borne unwittingly. So Heaven was pleased To wreak some old offence upon our race. Since in myself you will find no stain of sin For which such ruinous error ’gainst myself And mine own house might be the recompense. Tell me, I pray thee, if a word from Heaven Came to my father through the oracle That he should die by his son’s hand,—what right Hast thou to fasten that reproach on me, The child not yet begotten of my sire, An unborn nothing, unconceived? Or if, Born as I was to misery, I encountered And killed my father in an angry fray, Nought knowing of what I did or whom I slew, What reason is’t to blame the unwitting deed? And, oh, thou wretch! art not ashamed to force me To speak that of my mother, thine own sister, Which I will speak, for I will not keep silence, Since thou hast been thus impious with thy tongue. She was my mother, oh, the bitter word! Though neither knew it, and having borne me, she Became the mother of children to her son, An infamous birth! Yet this I know, thy crime Of speech against us both is voluntary. But all involuntary was my deed In marriage and is this mine utterance now. No,—that shall not be called a bosom-sin, Nor shall my name be sullied with the deed, Thy tongue would brand on me, against my sire. For answer me one question. If to-day, Here, now, one struck at thee a murderous stroke,— At thee, the righteous person,—wouldst thou ask [page 291][994-1028] If such assailant were thy sire, or strike Forthwith? Methinks, as one who cares to live, You would strike before you questioned of the right, Or reasoned of his kindred whom you slew. Such was the net that snared me}
\par   such the woes Heaven drew me to fulfil. My father’s spirit, Came he to life, would not gainsay my word. But thou, to whom, beneath the garb of right, No matter is too dreadful or too deep For words, so rail’st on me, in such a presence. Well thou dost flatter the great name of Theseus, And Athens in her glory stablished here, But midst thy fulsome praises thou forgettest How of all lands that yield the immortal Gods Just homage of true piety, this land Is foremost. Yet from hence thou would’st beguile Me, the aged suppliant. Nay, from hence thou would’st drag Myself with violence, and hast reft away My children. Wherefore I conjure these powers, With solemn invocation and appeal, To come and take my part, that thou may’st know What men they are who guard this hallowed realm.

\par \textbf{CH. My lord, the stranger deserves well. His fate Is grievous, but the more demands our aid.}

But if men flee and bear them, we may spare Superfluous labour. Others hotly urge That business, whom those robbers shall not boast Before their Gods to have ’scaped out of this land. Come, be our guide! Thou hast and hast not. Fortune Hath seized thee seizing on thy prey. So quickly Passes the gain that’s got by wrongful guile. Nay, thou shalt have no helper. Well I wot [page 292][1029-1065] Thou flew’st not to this pitch of truculent pride Alone, or unsupported by intrigue; But thy bold act hath some confederate here. This I must look into, nor let great Athens Prove herself weaker than one single man. Hast caught my drift? Or is my voice as vain Now, as you thought it when you planned this thing?}

Since only in Athens, only here i’ the world, Have I found pious thought and righteous care, And truth in word and deed. From a full heart And thankful mind I thus requite thy love, Knowing all I have is due to none but thee. Extend to me, I pray thee, thy right hand, O King, that I may feel thee, and may kiss, If that be lawful, thy dear head! And yet What am I asking? How can one like me Desire of thee to touch an outlawed man, On whose dark life all stains of sin and woe Are fixed indelibly? I will not dare— [page 295][1135-1169] No, nor allow thee!—None but only they Who have experience of such woes as mine May share their wretchedness. Thou, where thou art Receive my salutation, and henceforth Continue in thy promised care of me As true as to this moment thou hast proved.}
\par 

\par \textbf{THE. I marvel not at all if mere delight In these thy daughters lengthened thy discourse, Or led thee to address them before me. That gives me not the shadow of annoy. Nor am I careful to adorn my life With words of praise, but with the light of deeds. And thou hast proof of this. For I have failed In nought of all I promised, agèd King! Here stand I with thy children in full life Unharmed in aught the foe had threatened them. And now why vaunt the deeds that won the day, When these dear maids will tell them in thine ear? But let me crave thy counsel on a thing That crossed me as I came. Small though it seem When told, ’tis worthy of some wonder, too. Be it small or great, men should not let things pass.}

\par

\par \textbf{ANT. Father, give ear, though I be young that speak. Yield to the scruple of the King, who claims This reverence for his people’s God, and yield To us who beg our brother may come near.

Whence, were his heartless conduct against thee Beyond redemption impious, O my sire, Thy vengeance still would be unnatural. Oh let him!—Others have had evil sons And passionate anger, but the warning voice Of friends hath charmed their mood. Then do not thou Look narrowly upon thy present griefs, But on those ancient wrongs thou didst endure From father and from mother. Thence thou wilt learn That evil passion ever ends in woe. Thy sightless eyes are no light argument To warn thee through the feeling of thy loss. Relent and hear us! ’Tis a mere disgrace To beg so long for a just boon. The King Is kind to thee. Be generous in return.}

And likewise miserable appears the store He bears to nourish that time-wasted frame. Wretch that I am! Too late I learn the truth, And here give witness to mine own disgrace, Which is as deep as thy distress. Myself Declare it. Ask not others of my guilt. But seeing that Zeus on his almighty throne Keeps Mercy in all he doth to counsel him, Thou, too, my father, let her plead with thee! The evil that is done may yet be healed; It cannot be augmented. Art thou silent? O turn not from me, father! Speak but once! Wilt thou not answer, but with shame dismiss me Voiceless, nor make known wherefore thou art wroth? O ye his daughters, one with me in blood, Say, will not ye endeavour to unlock The stern lips of our unrelenting sire?

\par \textbf{POL. I will tell my need}
\par  — First claiming for protector the dread God From whose high altar he who rules this land Hath brought me under safe-guard of his power, Scatheless to speak and hear and go my way. His word, I am well assured, will be made good, Strangers, by you, and by my sisters twain, And by our sire.—Now let me name mine errand. I am banished, father, from our native land, Because, being elder-born, I claimed to sit Upon thy sovereign throne. For this offence Eteocles, thy younger son, exíled me, Not having won the advantage in debate Or trial of manhood, but through guileful art Gaining the people’s will. Whereof I deem Thy Fury the chief author; and thereto Prophetic voices also testify. For when I had come to Dorian Argolis, I raised, through marriage with Adrastus’ child, An army bound in friendly league with me, Led by the men who in the Apian land Hold first pre-eminence and honour in war, With whose aid levying all that mighty host Of seven battalions, I have deeply sworn Either to die, or drive from Theban ground Those who such wrongs have wrought. So far, so well. But why come hither? Father, to crave thine aid With earnest supplication for myself And for my firm allies, who at this hour, Seven leaders of seven bands embattled there, Encompass Thebè’s plain. Amphiaráus, Foremost in augury, foremost in war, First wields his warlike spear. Next, Oeneus’ son, Aetolian Tydeus; then Etéoclus Of Argive lineage; fourth, Hippomedon, Sent by his father Tálaüs, and the fifth [page 300][1319-1354] Is Capancus, who brags he will destroy Thebè with desolating fire. The sixth, Parthonopaeus, from the Arcadian glen Comes bravely down, swift Atalanta’s child, Named from his mother’s lingering maidenhood Ere she conceived him. And the seventh am I, Thy son, or if not thine, but the dire birth Of evil Destiny, yet named thy son, Who lead this dauntless host from Argolis Against the Theban land. Now one and all We pray thee on our knees, conjuring thee As thou dost love these maids and thine own life, My father, to forgive me, ere I go To be revenged upon my brother there Who drave me forth and robbed me of my throne. If aught in prophecy deserves belief, ’Tis certain, whom thou favourest, those shall win. Now by the wells whereof our fathers drank And by the Gods they worshipped, hear our prayer, Grant this petition:  since alike in woe, Alike in poverty and banishment, Partakers of one destiny, thou and I Cringe to the stranger for a dwelling place. Whilst he at home, the tyrant, woe is me, Laughs at us both in soft luxurious pride. Whose might, so thou wilt favour my design, I will lightly scatter in one little hour; And plant thee in thy Theban palace home Near to myself, hurling the usurper forth. All this with thy consent I shall achieve, But without thee, I forfeit life and all.

\par \textbf{CH. For his sake who hath brought him, Oedipus, Say what is meet, and let him go in peace.}
\par 

\par \textbf{OED. Ay, were it not the lord of all this land Theseus, that brought him to me and desired He might hear words from me,—never again Had these tones fallen upon his ear. But now That boon is granted him}
\par   he shall obtain, Ere he depart, such utterance of my tongue, As ne’er shall give him joy,—ne’er comfort thee, [page 301][1354-1390] Villain, who when possessed of the chief power Which now thy brother holds o’er Theban land, Didst banish me, thy father, who stand here, To live in exile, clothed with such attire, That moves thy tears now that thine own estate Is fallen into like depth of struggling woe. But tears are bootless. Howsoe’er I live, I must endure, and hold thee still my murderer. ’Tis thou hast girt me round with misery, ’Tis thou didst drive me forth, and driven by thee I beg my bread, a wandering sojourner. Yea, had these daughters not been born to me To tend me, I were dead, for all thou hast done. They have rescued, they have nursed me. They are men, Not women, in the strength of ministry. Ye are another’s, not my sons—For this The eye of Destiny pursues thee still Eager to light on thee with instant doom If once that army move toward the town Of ancient Thebes,—the town, no dearer name, ‘City’ or ‘Country’ shall beseem thy lip Till ye both fall, stained with fraternal gore Long since I launched that curse against you twain Which here again I summon to mine aid, That ye may learn what duty children owe To a parent, nor account it a light thing That ye were cruel sons to your blind sire. These maidens did not so. Wherefore my curse Prevails against thy prayer for Thebe’s throne, If ancient Zeus, the eternal lawgiver, Have primal Justice for his counsellor. Begone, renounced and fatherless for me, And take with thee, vilest of villanous men, This imprecation: —Vain be thine attempt In levying war against thy father’s race, Frustrate be thy return to Argos’ vale:  Die foully by a fratricidal hand And foully slay him who hath banished thee! Further, I bid the horror breathing gloom Tartarean, of the vault that holds my sire, [page 302][1391-1427] To banish thee from that last home:  I invoke The Spirits who haunt this ground, and the fierce God Who hath filled you both with this unnatural hate.— Go now with all this in thine ears, and tell The people of Cadmus and thy firm allies In whom thou trustest, what inheritance Oedipus hath divided to his sons.

\par \textbf{CH. ’Tis pity for thee, prince, to have come at all; And now we bid thee go the way thou camest.}
\par 

\par \textbf{POL. Alas! Vain enterprise, and hope undone! Oh, my poor comrades! To what fatal end I led you forth from Argos, woe is me! I may not tell it you,—no, nor return. In silence I must go to meet my doom. Daughters of this inexorable sire, Since now ye have heard his cruel curse on me, Ah! in Heaven’s name, my sisters, do not you Treat me despitefully, but if, one day, Our father’s execration is fulfilled And ye shall be restored to Theban ground, Grace me with funeral honours and a tomb! So shall this ample praise which ye receive For filial ministration, in that day Be more than doubled through your care for me.}

\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Know it once for all, He hath left eternally the light of day.}
\par 

\par \textbf{CH. Poor soul! What? Ended he with peace divine?}
\par 

\par \textbf{MESS. Ay, there is the main marvel. How he moved From hence, thou knowest, for thou too wert here, And saw’st that of his friends none guided him, But he they loved was leader to them all. Now, when he came to the steep pavement, rooted [page 308][1591-1628] With adamant foundation deep in Earth, On one of many paths he took his stand Near the stone basin, where Peirithoüs And Theseus graved their everlasting league. There, opposite the mass of Laurian ore, Turned from the hollow pear-tree and the tomb Of marble, he sate down, and straight undid His travel-soiled attire, then called aloud On both his children, and bade some one fetch Pure water from a running stream. And they, Hasting together to the neighbouring hill Of green Demeter, goddess of the Spring, Brought back their sire’s commission speedily, And bathed, and clothed him with the sacred robe. When he was satisfied, and nothing now Remained undone of all he bade them do, The God of darkness thundered, and the maids Stood horror-stricken on hearing; then together Fell at their father’s knees and wept and wailed Loudly and long with beating of the breast. He, when that sound of sorrow pierced his ear, Caressed them in his arms and said}
\par  —‘My daughters, From this day forth you have no more a father. All that was mine is ended, and no longer Shall ye continue your hard ministry Of labour for my life.—And yet, though hard, Not unendurable, since all the toil Was rendered light through love, which ye can never Receive on earth so richly, as from him Bereaved of whom ye now shall live forlorn.’ Such was the talk, mingled with sobs and crying, As each clung fast to each. But when they came To an end of weeping and those sounds were stilled, First all was silent; then a sudden voice Hurried him onward, making each man’s hair Bristle on end with force of instant fear. Now here, now there, not once but oftentimes, A God called loudly, ‘Oedipus, Oedipus! Why thus delay our going? This long while We are stayed for and thou tarriest. Come away!’ [page 309][1629-1666] He, when he knew the summons of the God, Gave word for royal Theseus to go near; And when he came, said:  ‘Friend for ever kind, Reach thy right hand, I pray thee (that first pledge) To these my children: —daughters, yours to him!— And give thy sacred word that thou wilt never Betray these willingly:  but still perform All that thou mayest with true thought for their good.’ He, with grand calmness like his noble self, Promised on oath to keep this friendly bond. And when he had done so, Oedipus forthwith Stroking his children with his helpless hands Spake thus: —‘My daughters, you must steel your hearts To noble firmness, and depart from hence, Nor ask to see or hear forbidden things. Go, go at once! Theseus alone must stay Sole rightful witness of these mysteries.’ Those accents were the last we all might hear. Then, following the two maids, with checkless tears And groans we took our way. But by and by, At distance looking round, we saw,—not him, Who was not there,—but Theseus all alone Holding his hand before his eyes, as if Some apparition unendurable Had dazed his vision. In a little while, We marked him making reverence in one prayer To the Earth, and to the home of Gods on high. But by what fate He perished, mortal man, Save Theseus, none can say. No lightning-flash From heaven, no tempest rising from the deep, Caused his departure in that hour, but either Some messenger from heaven, or, from beneath, The lower part of Earth, where comes no pain, Opening kindly to receive him in. Not to be mourned, nor with a tearful end Of sickness was he taken from the Earth, But wondrously, beyond recorded fate. If any deem my words unwise, I care not In that man’s judgement to be counted wise.

\par \textbf{[page 310][1667-1705] CH. Where are those maidens and their escort? Say.}
