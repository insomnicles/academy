                        <div class="sentence"> I have also derived much assistance from the great work of Mr. Grote, which contains excellent analyses of the Dialogues, and is rich in original thoughts and observations.</div><div class="sentence"> I agree with him in rejecting as futile the attempt of Schleiermacher and others to arrange the Dialogues of Plato into a harmonious whole.</div><div class="sentence"> Any such arrangement appears to me not only to be unsupported by evidence, but to involve an anachronism in the history of philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a common spirit in the writings of Plato, but not a unity of design in the whole, nor perhaps a perfect unity in any single Dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> The hypothesis of a general plan which is worked out in the successive Dialogues is an after-thought of the critics who have attributed a system to writings belonging to an age when system had not as yet taken possession of philosophy.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> If Mr. Grote should do me the honour to read any portion of this work he will probably remark that I have endeavoured to approach Plato from a point of view which is opposed to his own.</div><div class="sentence"> The aim of the Introductions in these volumes has been to represent Plato as the father of Idealism, who is not to be measured by the standard of utilitarianism or any other modern philosophical system.</div><div class="sentence"> He is the poet or maker of ideas, satisfying the wants of his own age, providing the instruments of thought for future generations.</div><div class="sentence"> He is no dreamer, but a great philosophical genius struggling with the unequal conditions of light and knowledge under which he is living.</div><div class="sentence"> He may be illustrated by the writings of moderns, but he must be interpreted by his own, and by his place in the history of philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> We are not concerned to determine what is the residuum of truth which remains for ourselves.</div><div class="sentence"> His truth may not be our truth, and nevertheless may have an extraordinary value and interest for us.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> I cannot agree with Mr. Grote in admitting as genuine all the writings commonly attributed to Plato in antiquity, any more than with Schaarschmidt and some other German critics who reject nearly half of them.</div><div class="sentence"> The German critics, to whom I refer, proceed chiefly on grounds of internal evidence; they appear to me to lay too much stress on the variety of doctrine and style, which must be equally acknowledged as a fact, even in the Dialogues regarded by Schaarschmidt as genuine, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> in the Phaedrus, or Symposium, when compared with the Laws.</div><div class="sentence"> He who admits works so different in style and matter to have been the composition of the same author, need have no difficulty in admitting the Sophist or the Politicus.</div><div class="sentence"> (The negative argument adduced by the same school of critics, which is based on the silence of Aristotle, is not worthy of much consideration.</div><div class="sentence"> For why should Aristotle, because he has quoted several Dialogues of Plato, have quoted them all?</div><div class="sentence"> Something must be allowed to chance, and to the nature of the subjects treated of in them.)</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, Mr. Grote trusts mainly to the Alexandrian Canon.</div><div class="sentence"> But I hardly think that we are justified in attributing much weight to the authority of the Alexandrian librarians in an age when there was no regular publication of books, and every temptation to forge them; and in which the writings of a school were naturally attributed to the founder of the school.</div><div class="sentence"> And even without intentional fraud, there was an inclination to believe rather than to enquire.</div><div class="sentence"> Would Mr. Grote accept as genuine all the writings which he finds in the lists of learned ancients attributed to Hippocrates, to Xenophon, to Aristotle?</div><div class="sentence"> The Alexandrian Canon of the Platonic writings is deprived of credit by the admission of the Epistles, which are not only unworthy of Plato, and in several passages plagiarized from him, but flagrantly at variance with historical fact.</div><div class="sentence"> It will be seen also that I do not agree with Mr. Grote's views about the Sophists; nor with the low estimate which he has formed of Plato's Laws; nor with his opinion respecting Plato's doctrine of the rotation of the earth.</div><div class="sentence"> But I 'am not going to lay hands on my father Parmenides' (Soph.</div><div class="sentence"> ), who will, I hope, forgive me for differing from him on these points.</div><div class="sentence"> I cannot close this Preface without expressing my deep respect for his noble and gentle character, and the great services which he has rendered to Greek Literature.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> I.</div><div class="sentence"> An English translation ought to be idiomatic and interesting, not only to the scholar, but to the unlearned reader.</div><div class="sentence"> Its object should not simply be to render the words of one language into the words of another or to preserve the construction and order of the original;—this is the ambition of a schoolboy, who wishes to show that he has made a good use of his Dictionary and Grammar; but is quite unworthy of the translator, who seeks to produce on his reader an impression similar or nearly similar to that produced by the original.</div><div class="sentence"> To him the feeling should be more important than the exact word.</div><div class="sentence"> He should remember Dryden's quaint admonition not to 'lacquey by the side of his author, but to mount up behind him.'</div><div class="sentence"> (Dedication to the Aeneis.)</div><div class="sentence"> He must carry in his mind a comprehensive view of the whole work, of what has preceded and of what is to follow,—as well as of the meaning of particular passages.</div><div class="sentence"> His version should be based, in the first instance, on an intimate knowledge of the text; but the precise order and arrangement of the words may be left to fade out of sight, when the translation begins to take shape.</div><div class="sentence"> He must form a general idea of the two languages, and reduce the one to the terms of the other.</div><div class="sentence"> His work should be rhythmical and varied, the right admixture of words and syllables, and even of letters, should be carefully attended to; above all, it should be equable in style.</div><div class="sentence"> There must also be quantity, which is necessary in prose as well as in verse: clauses, sentences, paragraphs, must be in due proportion.</div><div class="sentence"> Metre and even rhyme may be rarely admitted; though neither is a legitimate element of prose writing, they may help to lighten a cumbrous expression (Symp.).</div><div class="sentence"> The translation should retain as far as possible the characteristic qualities of the ancient writer—his freedom, grace, simplicity, stateliness, weight, precision; or the best part of him will be lost to the English reader.</div><div class="sentence"> It should read as an original work, and should also be the most faithful transcript which can be made of the language from which the translation is taken, consistently with the first requirement of all, that it be English.</div><div class="sentence"> Further, the translation being English, it should also be perfectly intelligible in itself without reference to the Greek, the English being really the more lucid and exact of the two languages.</div><div class="sentence"> In some respects it may be maintained that ordinary English writing, such as the newspaper article, is superior to Plato: at any rate it is couched in language which is very rarely obscure.</div><div class="sentence"> On the other hand, the greatest writers of Greece, Thucydides, Plato, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Pindar, Demosthenes, are generally those which are found to be most difficult and to diverge most widely from the English idiom.</div><div class="sentence"> The translator will often have to convert the more abstract Greek into the more concrete English, or vice versa, and he ought not to force upon one language the character of another.</div><div class="sentence"> In some cases, where the order is confused, the expression feeble, the emphasis misplaced, or the sense somewhat faulty, he will not strive in his rendering to reproduce these characteristics, but will re-write the passage as his author would have written it at first, had he not been 'nodding'; and he will not hesitate to supply anything which, owing to the genius of the language or some accident of composition, is omitted in the Greek, but is necessary to make the English clear and consecutive.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> The dramatic interest of the Dialogue chiefly centres in the youth Charmides, with whom Socrates talks in the kindly spirit of an elder.</div><div class="sentence"> His childlike simplicity and ingenuousness are contrasted with the dialectical and rhetorical arts of Critias, who is the grown-up man of the world, having a tincture of philosophy.</div><div class="sentence"> No hint is given, either here or in the Timaeus, of the infamy which attaches to the name of the latter in Athenian history.</div><div class="sentence"> He is simply a cultivated person who, like his kinsman Plato, is ennobled by the connection of his family with Solon (Tim.</div><div class="sentence"> ), and had been the follower, if not the disciple, both of Socrates and of the Sophists.</div><div class="sentence"> In the argument he is not unfair, if allowance is made for a slight rhetorical tendency, and for a natural desire to save his reputation with the company; he is sometimes nearer the truth than Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> Nothing in his language or behaviour is unbecoming the guardian of the beautiful Charmides.</div><div class="sentence"> His love of reputation is characteristically Greek, and contrasts with the humility of Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor in Charmides himself do we find any resemblance to the Charmides of history, except, perhaps, the modest and retiring nature which, according to Xenophon, at one time of his life prevented him from speaking in the Assembly (Mem.</div><div class="sentence"> ); and we are surprised to hear that, like Critias, he afterwards became one of the thirty tyrants.</div><div class="sentence"> In the Dialogue he is a pattern of virtue, and is therefore in no need of the charm which Socrates is unable to apply.</div><div class="sentence"> With youthful naivete, keeping his secret and entering into the spirit of Socrates, he enjoys the detection of his elder and guardian Critias, who is easily seen to be the author of the definition which he has so great an interest in maintaining.</div><div class="sentence"> The preceding definition, 'Temperance is doing one's own business,' is assumed to have been borrowed by Charmides from another; and when the enquiry becomes more abstract he is superseded by Critias (Theaet.</div><div class="sentence"> ; Euthyd.).</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates preserves his accustomed irony to the end; he is in the neighbourhood of several great truths, which he views in various lights, but always either by bringing them to the test of common sense, or by demanding too great exactness in the use of words, turns aside from them and comes at last to no conclusion.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> The difficulty of the Charmides arises chiefly from the two senses of the word (Greek), or temperance.</div><div class="sentence"> From the ethical notion of temperance, which is variously defined to be quietness, modesty, doing our own business, the doing of good actions, the dialogue passes onto the intellectual conception of (Greek), which is declared also to be the science of self-knowledge, or of the knowledge of what we know and do not know, or of the knowledge of good and evil.</div><div class="sentence"> The dialogue represents a stage in the history of philosophy in which knowledge and action were not yet distinguished.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence the confusion between them, and the easy transition from one to the other.</div><div class="sentence"> The definitions which are offered are all rejected, but it is to be observed that they all tend to throw a light on the nature of temperance, and that, unlike the distinction of Critias between (Greek), none of them are merely verbal quibbles, it is implied that this question, although it has not yet received a solution in theory, has been already answered by Charmides himself, who has learned to practise the virtue of self-knowledge which philosophers are vainly trying to define in words.</div><div class="sentence"> In a similar spirit we might say to a young man who is disturbed by theological difficulties, 'Do not trouble yourself about such matters, but only lead a good life;' and yet in either case it is not to be denied that right ideas of truth may contribute greatly to the improvement of character.</div>
