                        <div class="sentence"> In several of the dialogues of Plato, doubts have arisen among his interpreters as to which of the various subjects discussed in them is the main thesis.</div><div class="sentence"> The speakers have the freedom of conversation; no severe rules of art restrict them, and sometimes we are inclined to think, with one of the dramatis personae in the Theaetetus, that the digressions have the greater interest.</div><div class="sentence"> Yet in the most irregular of the dialogues there is also a certain natural growth or unity; the beginning is not forgotten at the end, and numerous allusions and references are interspersed, which form the loose connecting links of the whole.</div><div class="sentence"> We must not neglect this unity, but neither must we attempt to confine the Platonic dialogue on the Procrustean bed of a single idea.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Introduction to the Phaedrus.)</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> Two tendencies seem to have beset the interpreters of Plato in this matter.</div><div class="sentence"> First, they have endeavoured to hang the dialogues upon one another by the slightest threads; and have thus been led to opposite and contradictory assertions respecting their order and sequence.</div><div class="sentence"> The mantle of Schleiermacher has descended upon his successors, who have applied his method with the most various results.</div><div class="sentence"> The value and use of the method has been hardly, if at all, examined either by him or them.</div><div class="sentence"> Secondly, they have extended almost indefinitely the scope of each separate dialogue; in this way they think that they have escaped all difficulties, not seeing that what they have gained in generality they have lost in truth and distinctness.</div><div class="sentence"> Metaphysical conceptions easily pass into one another; and the simpler notions of antiquity, which we can only realize by an effort, imperceptibly blend with the more familiar theories of modern philosophers.</div><div class="sentence"> An eye for proportion is needed (his own art of measuring) in the study of Plato, as well as of other great artists.</div><div class="sentence"> We may hardly admit that the moral antithesis of good and pleasure, or the intellectual antithesis of knowledge and opinion, being and appearance, are never far off in a Platonic discussion.</div><div class="sentence"> But because they are in the background, we should not bring them into the foreground, or expect to discern them equally in all the dialogues.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> There may be some advantage in drawing out a little the main outlines of the building; but the use of this is limited, and may be easily exaggerated.</div><div class="sentence"> We may give Plato too much system, and alter the natural form and connection of his thoughts.</div><div class="sentence"> Under the idea that his dialogues are finished works of art, we may find a reason for everything, and lose the highest characteristic of art, which is simplicity.</div><div class="sentence"> Most great works receive a new light from a new and original mind.</div><div class="sentence"> But whether these new lights are true or only suggestive, will depend on their agreement with the spirit of Plato, and the amount of direct evidence which can be urged in support of them.</div><div class="sentence"> When a theory is running away with us, criticism does a friendly office in counselling moderation, and recalling us to the indications of the text.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> Like the Phaedrus, the Gorgias has puzzled students of Plato by the appearance of two or more subjects.</div><div class="sentence"> Under the cover of rhetoric higher themes are introduced; the argument expands into a general view of the good and evil of man.</div><div class="sentence"> After making an ineffectual attempt to obtain a sound definition of his art from Gorgias, Socrates assumes the existence of a universal art of flattery or simulation having several branches:âthis is the genus of which rhetoric is only one, and not the highest species.</div><div class="sentence"> To flattery is opposed the true and noble art of life which he who possesses seeks always to impart to others, and which at last triumphs, if not here, at any rate in another world.</div><div class="sentence"> These two aspects of life and knowledge appear to be the two leading ideas of the dialogue.</div><div class="sentence"> The true and the false in individuals and states, in the treatment of the soul as well as of the body, are conceived under the forms of true and false art.</div><div class="sentence"> In the development of this opposition there arise various other questions, such as the two famous paradoxes of Socrates (paradoxes as they are to the world in general, ideals as they may be more worthily called): (1) that to do is worse than to suffer evil; and (2) that when a man has done evil he had better be punished than unpunished; to which may be added (3) a third Socratic paradox or ideal, that bad men do what they think best, but not what they desire, for the desire of all is towards the good.</div><div class="sentence"> That pleasure is to be distinguished from good is proved by the simultaneousness of pleasure and pain, and by the possibility of the bad having in certain cases pleasures as great as those of the good, or even greater.</div><div class="sentence"> Not merely rhetoricians, but poets, musicians, and other artists, the whole tribe of statesmen, past as well as present, are included in the class of flatterers.</div><div class="sentence"> The true and false finally appear before the judgment-seat of the gods below.</div>
                    </div>

                        <div class="sentence"> The dialogue naturally falls into three divisions, to which the three characters of Gorgias, Polus, and Callicles respectively correspond; and the form and manner change with the stages of the argument.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates is deferential towards Gorgias, playful and yet cutting in dealing with the youthful Polus, ironical and sarcastic in his encounter with Callicles.</div><div class="sentence"> In the first division the question is askedâWhat is rhetoric?</div><div class="sentence"> To this there is no answer given, for Gorgias is soon made to contradict himself by Socrates, and the argument is transferred to the hands of his disciple Polus, who rushes to the defence of his master.</div><div class="sentence"> The answer has at last to be given by Socrates himself, but before he can even explain his meaning to Polus, he must enlighten him upon the great subject of shams or flatteries.</div><div class="sentence"> When Polus finds his favourite art reduced to the level of cookery, he replies that at any rate rhetoricians, like despots, have great power.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates denies that they have any real power, and hence arise the three paradoxes already mentioned.</div><div class="sentence"> Although they are strange to him, Polus is at last convinced of their truth; at least, they seem to him to follow legitimately from the premises.</div><div class="sentence"> Thus the second act of the dialogue closes.</div><div class="sentence"> Then Callicles appears on the scene, at first maintaining that pleasure is good, and that might is right, and that law is nothing but the combination of the many weak against the few strong.</div><div class="sentence"> When he is confuted he withdraws from the argument, and leaves Socrates to arrive at the conclusion by himself.</div><div class="sentence"> The conclusion is that there are two kinds of statesmanship, a higher and a lowerâthat which makes the people better, and that which only flatters them, and he exhorts Callicles to choose the higher.</div><div class="sentence"> The dialogue terminates with a mythus of a final judgment, in which there will be no more flattery or disguise, and no further use for the teaching of rhetoric.</div>
                    </div>
                 <div class="text">

                        <div class="sentence"> The characters of the three interlocutors also correspond to the parts which are assigned to them.</div><div class="sentence"> Gorgias is the great rhetorician, now advanced in years, who goes from city to city displaying his talents, and is celebrated throughout Greece.</div><div class="sentence"> Like all the Sophists in the dialogues of Plato, he is vain and boastful, yet he has also a certain dignity, and is treated by Socrates with considerable respect.</div><div class="sentence"> But he is no match for him in dialectics.</div><div class="sentence"> Although he has been teaching rhetoric all his life, he is still incapable of defining his own art.</div><div class="sentence"> When his ideas begin to clear up, he is unwilling to admit that rhetoric can be wholly separated from justice and injustice, and this lingering sentiment of morality, or regard for public opinion, enables Socrates to detect him in a contradiction.</div><div class="sentence"> Like Protagoras, he is described as of a generous nature; he expresses his approbation of Socratesâ manner of approaching a question; he is quite âone of Socratesâ sort, ready to be refuted as well as to refute,â and very eager that Callicles and Socrates should have the game out.</div><div class="sentence"> He knows by experience that rhetoric exercises great influence over other men, but he is unable to explain the puzzle how rhetoric can teach everything and know nothing.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> Polus is an impetuous youth, a runaway âcolt,â as Socrates describes him, who wanted originally to have taken the place of Gorgias under the pretext that the old man was tired, and now avails himself of the earliest opportunity to enter the lists.</div><div class="sentence"> He is said to be the author of a work on rhetoric, and is again mentioned in the Phaedrus, as the inventor of balanced or double forms of speech (compare Gorg.</div><div class="sentence"> ; Symp.).</div><div class="sentence"> At first he is violent and ill-mannered, and is angry at seeing his master overthrown.</div><div class="sentence"> But in the judicious hands of Socrates he is soon restored to good-humour, and compelled to assent to the required conclusion.</div><div class="sentence"> Like Gorgias, he is overthrown because he compromises; he is unwilling to say that to do is fairer or more honourable than to suffer injustice.</div><div class="sentence"> Though he is fascinated by the power of rhetoric, and dazzled by the splendour of success, he is not insensible to higher arguments.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato may have felt that there would be an incongruity in a youth maintaining the cause of injustice against the world.</div><div class="sentence"> He has never heard the other side of the question, and he listens to the paradoxes, as they appear to him, of Socrates with evident astonishment.</div><div class="sentence"> He can hardly understand the meaning of Archelaus being miserable, or of rhetoric being only useful in self-accusation.</div><div class="sentence"> When the argument with him has fairly run out.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> Callicles, in whose house they are assembled, is introduced on the stage: he is with difficulty convinced that Socrates is in earnest; for if these things are true, then, as he says with real emotion, the foundations of society are upside down.</div><div class="sentence"> In him another type of character is represented; he is neither sophist nor philosopher, but man of the world, and an accomplished Athenian gentleman.</div><div class="sentence"> He might be described in modern language as a cynic or materialist, a lover of power and also of pleasure, and unscrupulous in his means of attaining both.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no desire on his part to offer any compromise in the interests of morality; nor is any concession made by him.</div><div class="sentence"> Like Thrasymachus in the Republic, though he is not of the same weak and vulgar class, he consistently maintains that might is right.</div><div class="sentence"> His great motive of action is political ambition; in this he is characteristically Greek.</div><div class="sentence"> Like Anytus in the Meno, he is the enemy of the Sophists; but favours the new art of rhetoric, which he regards as an excellent weapon of attack and defence.</div><div class="sentence"> He is a despiser of mankind as he is of philosophy, and sees in the laws of the state only a violation of the order of nature, which intended that the stronger should govern the weaker (compare Republic).</div><div class="sentence"> Like other men of the world who are of a speculative turn of mind, he generalizes the bad side of human nature, and has easily brought down his principles to his practice.</div><div class="sentence"> Philosophy and poetry alike supply him with distinctions suited to his view of human life.</div><div class="sentence"> He has a good will to Socrates, whose talents he evidently admires, while he censures the puerile use which he makes of them.</div><div class="sentence"> He expresses a keen intellectual interest in the argument.</div><div class="sentence"> Like Anytus, again, he has a sympathy with other men of the world; the Athenian statesmen of a former generation, who showed no weakness and made no mistakes, such as Miltiades, Themistocles, Pericles, are his favourites.</div><div class="sentence"> His ideal of human character is a man of great passions and great powers, which he has developed to the utmost, and which he uses in his own enjoyment and in the government of others.</div><div class="sentence"> Had Critias been the name instead of Callicles, about whom we know nothing from other sources, the opinions of the man would have seemed to reflect the history of his life.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> And now the combat deepens.</div><div class="sentence"> In Callicles, far more than in any sophist or rhetorician, is concentrated the spirit of evil against which Socrates is contending, the spirit of the world, the spirit of the many contending against the one wise man, of which the Sophists, as he describes them in the Republic, are the imitators rather than the authors, being themselves carried away by the great tide of public opinion.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates approaches his antagonist warily from a distance, with a sort of irony which touches with a light hand both his personal vices (probably in allusion to some scandal of the day) and his servility to the populace.</div><div class="sentence"> At the same time, he is in most profound earnest, as Chaerephon remarks.</div><div class="sentence"> Callicles soon loses his temper, but the more he is irritated, the more provoking and matter of fact does Socrates become.</div><div class="sentence"> A repartee of his which appears to have been really made to the âomniscientâ Hippias, according to the testimony of Xenophon (Mem.</div><div class="sentence"> ), is introduced.</div><div class="sentence"> He is called by Callicles a popular declaimer, and certainly shows that he has the power, in the words of Gorgias, of being âas long as he pleases,â or âas short as he pleasesâ (compare Protag.).</div><div class="sentence"> Callicles exhibits great ability in defending himself and attacking Socrates, whom he accuses of trifling and word-splitting; he is scandalized that the legitimate consequences of his own argument should be stated in plain terms; after the manner of men of the world, he wishes to preserve the decencies of life.</div><div class="sentence"> But he cannot consistently maintain the bad sense of words; and getting confused between the abstract notions of better, superior, stronger, he is easily turned round by Socrates, and only induced to continue the argument by the authority of Gorgias.</div><div class="sentence"> Once, when Socrates is describing the manner in which the ambitious citizen has to identify himself with the people, he partially recognizes the truth of his words.</div>
                    </div>
                 <div class="text">

                        <div class="sentence"> The Socrates of the Gorgias may be compared with the Socrates of the Protagoras and Meno.</div><div class="sentence"> As in other dialogues, he is the enemy of the Sophists and rhetoricians; and also of the statesmen, whom he regards as another variety of the same species.</div><div class="sentence"> His behaviour is governed by that of his opponents; the least forwardness or egotism on their part is met by a corresponding irony on the part of Socrates.</div><div class="sentence"> He must speak, for philosophy will not allow him to be silent.</div><div class="sentence"> He is indeed more ironical and provoking than in any other of Platoâs writings: for he is âfooled to the top of his bentâ by the worldliness of Callicles.</div><div class="sentence"> But he is also more deeply in earnest.</div><div class="sentence"> He rises higher than even in the Phaedo and Crito: at first enveloping his moral convictions in a cloud of dust and dialectics, he ends by losing his method, his life, himself, in them.</div><div class="sentence"> As in the Protagoras and Phaedrus, throwing aside the veil of irony, he makes a speech, but, true to his character, not until his adversary has refused to answer any more questions.</div><div class="sentence"> The presentiment of his own fate is hanging over him.</div><div class="sentence"> He is aware that Socrates, the single real teacher of politics, as he ventures to call himself, cannot safely go to war with the whole world, and that in the courts of earth he will be condemned.</div><div class="sentence"> But he will be justified in the world below.</div><div class="sentence"> Then the position of Socrates and Callicles will be reversed; all those things âunfit for ears politeâ which Callicles has prophesied as likely to happen to him in this life, the insulting language, the box on the ears, will recoil upon his assailant.</div><div class="sentence"> (Compare Republic, and the similar reversal of the position of the lawyer and the philosopher in the Theaetetus).</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> The myth of the Phaedo is of the same type, but it is more cosmological, and also more poetical.</div><div class="sentence"> The beautiful and ingenious fancy occurs to Plato that the upper atmosphere is an earth and heaven in one, a glorified earth, fairer and purer than that in which we dwell.</div><div class="sentence"> As the fishes live in the ocean, mankind are living in a lower sphere, out of which they put their heads for a moment or two and behold a world beyond.</div><div class="sentence"> The earth which we inhabit is a sediment of the coarser particles which drop from the world above, and is to that heavenly earth what the desert and the shores of the ocean are to us.</div><div class="sentence"> A part of the myth consists of description of the interior of the earth, which gives the opportunity of introducing several mythological names and of providing places of torment for the wicked.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no clear distinction of soul and body; the spirits beneath the earth are spoken of as souls only, yet they retain a sort of shadowy form when they cry for mercy on the shores of the lake; and the philosopher alone is said to have got rid of the body.</div><div class="sentence"> All the three myths in Plato which relate to the world below have a place for repentant sinners, as well as other homes or places for the very good and very bad.</div><div class="sentence"> It is a natural reflection which is made by Plato elsewhere, that the two extremes of human character are rarely met with, and that the generality of mankind are between them.</div><div class="sentence"> Hence a place must be found for them.</div><div class="sentence"> In the myth of the Phaedo they are carried down the river Acheron to the Acherusian lake, where they dwell, and are purified of their evil deeds, and receive the rewards of their good.</div><div class="sentence"> There are also incurable sinners, who are cast into Tartarus, there to remain as the penalty of atrocious crimes; these suffer everlastingly.</div><div class="sentence"> And there is another class of hardly-curable sinners who are allowed from time to time to approach the shores of the Acherusian lake, where they cry to their victims for mercy; which if they obtain they come out into the lake and cease from their torments.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> Neither this, nor any of the three greater myths of Plato, nor perhaps any allegory or parable relating to the unseen world, is consistent with itself.</div><div class="sentence"> The language of philosophy mingles with that of mythology; abstract ideas are transformed into persons, figures of speech into realities.</div><div class="sentence"> These myths may be compared with the Pilgrimâs Progress of Bunyan, in which discussions of theology are mixed up with the incidents of travel, and mythological personages are associated with human beings: they are also garnished with names and phrases taken out of Homer, and with other fragments of Greek tradition.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> The myth of the Republic is more subtle and also more consistent than either of the two others.</div><div class="sentence"> It has a greater verisimilitude than they have, and is full of touches which recall the experiences of human life.</div><div class="sentence"> It will be noticed by an attentive reader that the twelve days during which Er lay in a trance after he was slain coincide with the time passed by the spirits in their pilgrimage.</div><div class="sentence"> It is a curious observation, not often made, that good men who have lived in a well-governed city (shall we say in a religious and respectable society?)</div><div class="sentence"> are more likely to make mistakes in their choice of life than those who have had more experience of the world and of evil.</div><div class="sentence"> It is a more familiar remark that we constantly blame others when we have only ourselves to blame; and the philosopher must acknowledge, however reluctantly, that there is an element of chance in human life with which it is sometimes impossible for man to cope.</div><div class="sentence"> That men drink more of the waters of forgetfulness than is good for them is a poetical description of a familiar truth.</div><div class="sentence"> We have many of us known men who, like Odysseus, have wearied of ambition and have only desired rest.</div><div class="sentence"> We should like to know what became of the infants âdying almost as soon as they were born,â but Plato only raises, without satisfying, our curiosity.</div><div class="sentence"> The two companies of souls, ascending and descending at either chasm of heaven and earth, and conversing when they come out into the meadow, the majestic figures of the judges sitting in heaven, the voice heard by Ardiaeus, are features of the great allegory which have an indescribable grandeur and power.</div><div class="sentence"> The remark already made respecting the inconsistency of the two other myths must be extended also to this: it is at once an orrery, or model of the heavens, and a picture of the Day of Judgment.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> The three myths are unlike anything else in Plato.</div><div class="sentence"> There is an Oriental, or rather an Egyptian element in them, and they have an affinity to the mysteries and to the Orphic modes of worship.</div><div class="sentence"> To a certain extent they are un-Greek; at any rate there is hardly anything like them in other Greek writings which have a serious purpose; in spirit they are mediaeval.</div><div class="sentence"> They are akin to what may be termed the underground religion in all ages and countries.</div><div class="sentence"> They are presented in the most lively and graphic manner, but they are never insisted on as true; it is only affirmed that nothing better can be said about a future life.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato seems to make use of them when he has reached the limits of human knowledge; or, to borrow an expression of his own, when he is standing on the outside of the intellectual world.</div><div class="sentence"> They are very simple in style; a few touches bring the picture home to the mind, and make it present to us.</div><div class="sentence"> They have also a kind of authority gained by the employment of sacred and familiar names, just as mere fragments of the words of Scripture, put together in any form and applied to any subject, have a power of their own.</div><div class="sentence"> They are a substitute for poetry and mythology; and they are also a reform of mythology.</div><div class="sentence"> The moral of them may be summed up in a word or two: After death the Judgment; and âthere is some better thing remaining for the good than for the evil.â</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> The myth in the Statesman relates to a former cycle of existence, in which men were born of the earth, and by the reversal of the earthâs motion had their lives reversed and were restored to youth and beauty: the dead came to life, the old grew middle-aged, and the middle-aged young; the youth became a child, the child an infant, the infant vanished into the earth.</div><div class="sentence"> The connection between the reversal of the earthâs motion and the reversal of human life is of course verbal only, yet Plato, like theologians in other ages, argues from the consistency of the tale to its truth.</div><div class="sentence"> The new order of the world was immediately under the government of God; it was a state of innocence in which men had neither wants nor cares, in which the earth brought forth all things spontaneously, and God was to man what man now is to the animals.</div><div class="sentence"> There were no great estates, or families, or private possessions, nor any traditions of the past, because men were all born out of the earth.</div><div class="sentence"> This is what Plato calls the âreign of Cronos;â and in like manner he connects the reversal of the earthâs motion with some legend of which he himself was probably the inventor.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> The question is then asked, under which of these two cycles of existence was man the happier,âunder that of Cronos, which was a state of innocence, or that of Zeus, which is our ordinary life?</div><div class="sentence"> For a while Plato balances the two sides of the serious controversy, which he has suggested in a figure.</div><div class="sentence"> The answer depends on another question: What use did the children of Cronos make of their time?</div><div class="sentence"> They had boundless leisure and the faculty of discoursing, not only with one another, but with the animals.</div><div class="sentence"> Did they employ these advantages with a view to philosophy, gathering from every nature some addition to their store of knowledge?</div><div class="sentence"> or, Did they pass their time in eating and drinking and telling stories to one another and to the beasts?âin either case there would be no difficulty in answering.</div><div class="sentence"> But then, as Plato rather mischievously adds, âNobody knows what they did,â and therefore the doubt must remain undetermined.</div>

GORGIAS
By Plato
Translated by Benjamin Jowett

PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE</strong>: Callicles, Socrates, Chaerephon, Gorgias, Polus.


SCENE  The house of Callicles.


CALLICLES  The wise man, as the proverb says, is late for a fray, but not for a
feast.


SOCRATES  And are we late for a feast?


CALLICLES  Yes, and a delightful feast; for Gorgias has just been exhibiting to
us many fine things.


SOCRATES  It is not my fault, Callicles; our friend Chaerephon is to blame; for
he would keep us loitering in the Agora.


CHAEREPHON  Never mind, Socrates; the misfortune of which I have been the cause
I will also repair; for Gorgias is a friend of mine, and I will make him give
the exhibition again either now, or, if you prefer, at some other time.


CALLICLES  What is the matter, Chaerephonâdoes Socrates want to hear
Gorgias?


CHAEREPHON  Yes, that was our intention in coming.


CALLICLES  Come into my house, then; for Gorgias is staying with me, and he
shall exhibit to you.


SOCRATES  Very good, Callicles; but will he answer our questions? for I want to
hear from him what is the nature of his art, and what it is which he professes
and teaches; he may, as you (Chaerephon) suggest, defer the exhibition to some
other time.


CALLICLES  There is nothing like asking him, Socrates; and indeed to answer
questions is a part of his exhibition, for he was saying only just now, that
any one in my house might put any question to him, and that he would answer.


SOCRATES  How fortunate! will you ask him, Chaerephonâ?


CHAEREPHON  What shall I ask him?


SOCRATES  Ask him who he is.


CHAEREPHON  What do you mean?


SOCRATES  I mean such a question as would elicit from him, if he had been a
maker of shoes, the answer that he is a cobbler. Do you understand?


CHAEREPHON  I understand, and will ask him  Tell me, Gorgias, is our friend
Callicles right in saying that you undertake to answer any questions which you
are asked?


GORGIAS  Quite right, Chaerephon  I was saying as much only just now; and I may
add, that many years have elapsed since any one has asked me a new one.


CHAEREPHON  Then you must be very ready, Gorgias.


GORGIAS  Of that, Chaerephon, you can make trial.


POLUS  Yes, indeed, and if you like, Chaerephon, you may make trial of me too,
for I think that Gorgias, who has been talking a long time, is tired.


CHAEREPHON  And do you, Polus, think that you can answer better than Gorgias?


POLUS  What does that matter if I answer well enough for you?


CHAEREPHON  Not at all âand you shall answer if you like.


POLUS  Ask â


CHAEREPHON  My question is this  If Gorgias had the skill of his brother
Herodicus, what ought we to call him? Ought he not to have the name which is
given to his brother?


POLUS  Certainly.


CHAEREPHON  Then we should be right in calling him a physician?


POLUS  Yes.


CHAEREPHON  And if he had the skill of Aristophon the son of Aglaophon, or of
his brother Polygnotus, what ought we to call him?


POLUS  Clearly, a painter.


CHAEREPHON  But now what shall we call himâwhat is the art in which he is
skilled.


POLUS  O Chaerephon, there are many arts among mankind which are experimental,
and have their origin in experience, for experience makes the days of men to
proceed according to art, and inexperience according to chance, and different
persons in different ways are proficient in different arts, and the best
persons in the best arts. And our friend Gorgias is one of the best, and the
art in which he is a proficient is the noblest.


SOCRATES  Polus has been taught how to make a capital speech, Gorgias; but he
is not fulfilling the promise which he made to Chaerephon.


GORGIAS  What do you mean, Socrates?


SOCRATES  I mean that he has not exactly answered the question which he was
asked.


GORGIAS  Then why not ask him yourself?


SOCRATES  But I would much rather ask you, if you are disposed to answer  for I
see, from the few words which Polus has uttered, that he has attended more to
the art which is called rhetoric than to dialectic.


POLUS  What makes you say so, Socrates?


SOCRATES  Because, Polus, when Chaerephon asked you what was the art which
Gorgias knows, you praised it as if you were answering some one who found fault
with it, but you never said what the art was.


POLUS  Why, did I not say that it was the noblest of arts?


SOCRATES  Yes, indeed, but that was no answer to the question  nobody asked
what was the quality, but what was the nature, of the art, and by what name we
were to describe Gorgias. And I would still beg you briefly and clearly, as you
answered Chaerephon when he asked you at first, to say what this art is, and
what we ought to call Gorgias  Or rather, Gorgias, let me turn to you, and ask
the same question,âwhat are we to call you, and what is the art which you
profess?


GORGIAS  Rhetoric, Socrates, is my art.


SOCRATES  Then I am to call you a rhetorician?


GORGIAS  Yes, Socrates, and a good one too, if you would call me that which, in
Homeric language, âI boast myself to be.â


SOCRATES  I should wish to do so.


GORGIAS  Then pray do.


SOCRATES  And are we to say that you are able to make other men rhetoricians?


GORGIAS  Yes, that is exactly what I profess to make them, not only at Athens,
but in all places.


SOCRATES  And will you continue to ask and answer questions, Gorgias, as we are
at present doing, and reserve for another occasion the longer mode of speech
which Polus was attempting? Will you keep your promise, and answer shortly the
questions which are asked of you?


GORGIAS  Some answers, Socrates, are of necessity longer; but I will do my best
to make them as short as possible; for a part of my profession is that I can be
as short as any one.


SOCRATES  That is what is wanted, Gorgias; exhibit the shorter method now, and
the longer one at some other time.


GORGIAS  Well, I will; and you will certainly say, that you never heard a man
use fewer words.


SOCRATES  Very good then; as you profess to be a rhetorician, and a maker of
rhetoricians, let me ask you, with what is rhetoric concerned  I might ask with
what is weaving concerned, and you would reply (would you not?), with the
making of garments?


GORGIAS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And music is concerned with the composition of melodies?


GORGIAS  It is.


SOCRATES  By Here, Gorgias, I admire the surpassing brevity of your answers.


GORGIAS  Yes, Socrates, I do think myself good at that.


SOCRATES  I am glad to hear it; answer me in like manner about rhetoric  with
what is rhetoric concerned?


GORGIAS  With discourse.


SOCRATES  What sort of discourse, Gorgias?âsuch discourse as would teach
the sick under what treatment they might get well?


GORGIAS  No.


SOCRATES  Then rhetoric does not treat of all kinds of discourse?


GORGIAS  Certainly not.


SOCRATES  And yet rhetoric makes men able to speak?


GORGIAS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And to understand that about which they speak?


GORGIAS  Of course.


SOCRATES  But does not the art of medicine, which we were just now mentioning,
also make men able to understand and speak about the sick?


GORGIAS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  Then medicine also treats of discourse?


GORGIAS  Yes.


SOCRATES  Of discourse concerning diseases?


GORGIAS  Just so.


SOCRATES  And does not gymnastic also treat of discourse concerning the good or
evil condition of the body?


GORGIAS  Very true.


SOCRATES  And the same, Gorgias, is true of the other arts âall of them
treat of discourse concerning the subjects with which they severally have to
do.


GORGIAS  Clearly.


SOCRATES  Then why, if you call rhetoric the art which treats of discourse, and
all the other arts treat of discourse, do you not call them arts of rhetoric?


GORGIAS  Because, Socrates, the knowledge of the other arts has only to do with
some sort of external action, as of the hand; but there is no such action of
the hand in rhetoric which works and takes effect only through the medium of
discourse. And therefore I am justified in saying that rhetoric treats of
discourse.


SOCRATES  I am not sure whether I entirely understand you, but I dare say I
shall soon know better; please to answer me a question âyou would allow
that there are arts?


GORGIAS  Yes.


SOCRATES  As to the arts generally, they are for the most part concerned with
doing, and require little or no speaking; in painting, and statuary, and many
other arts, the work may proceed in silence; and of such arts I suppose you
would say that they do not come within the province of rhetoric.


GORGIAS  You perfectly conceive my meaning, Socrates.


SOCRATES  But there are other arts which work wholly through the medium of
language, and require either no action or very little, as, for example, the
arts of arithmetic, of calculation, of geometry, and of playing draughts; in
some of these speech is pretty nearly co-extensive with action, but in most of
them the verbal element is greaterâthey depend wholly on words for their
efficacy and power  and I take your meaning to be that rhetoric is an art of
this latter sort?


GORGIAS  Exactly.


SOCRATES  And yet I do not believe that you really mean to call any of these
arts rhetoric; although the precise expression which you used was, that
rhetoric is an art which works and takes effect only through the medium of
discourse; and an adversary who wished to be captious might say, âAnd so,
Gorgias, you call arithmetic rhetoric.â But I do not think that you
really call arithmetic rhetoric any more than geometry would be so called by
you.


GORGIAS  You are quite right, Socrates, in your apprehension of my meaning.


SOCRATES  Well, then, let me now have the rest of my answer âseeing that
rhetoric is one of those arts which works mainly by the use of words, and there
are other arts which also use words, tell me what is that quality in words with
which rhetoric is concerned âSuppose that a person asks me about some of
the arts which I was mentioning just now; he might say, âSocrates, what
is arithmetic?â and I should reply to him, as you replied to me, that
arithmetic is one of those arts which take effect through words. And then he
would proceed to ask  âWords about what?â and I should reply, Words
about odd and even numbers, and how many there are of each. And if he asked
again  âWhat is the art of calculation?â I should say, That also is
one of the arts which is concerned wholly with words. And if he further said,
âConcerned with what?â I should say, like the clerks in the
assembly, âas aforesaidâ of arithmetic, but with a difference, the
difference being that the art of calculation considers not only the quantities
of odd and even numbers, but also their numerical relations to themselves and
to one another. And suppose, again, I were to say that astronomy is only
wordsâhe would ask, âWords about what, Socrates?â and I
should answer, that astronomy tells us about the motions of the stars and sun
and moon, and their relative swiftness.


GORGIAS  You would be quite right, Socrates.


SOCRATES  And now let us have from you, Gorgias, the truth about rhetoric 
which you would admit (would you not?) to be one of those arts which act always
and fulfil all their ends through the medium of words?


GORGIAS  True.


SOCRATES  Words which do what? I should ask. To what class of things do the
words which rhetoric uses relate?


GORGIAS  To the greatest, Socrates, and the best of human things.


SOCRATES  That again, Gorgias is ambiguous; I am still in the dark  for which
are the greatest and best of human things? I dare say that you have heard men
singing at feasts the old drinking song, in which the singers enumerate the
goods of life, first health, beauty next, thirdly, as the writer of the song
says, wealth honestly obtained.


GORGIAS  Yes, I know the song; but what is your drift?


SOCRATES  I mean to say, that the producers of those things which the author of
the song praises, that is to say, the physician, the trainer, the money-maker,
will at once come to you, and first the physician will say  âO Socrates,
Gorgias is deceiving you, for my art is concerned with the greatest good of men
and not his.â And when I ask, Who are you? he will reply, âI am a
physician.â What do you mean? I shall say. Do you mean that your art
produces the greatest good? âCertainly,â he will answer, âfor
is not health the greatest good? What greater good can men have,
Socrates?â And after him the trainer will come and say, âI too,
Socrates, shall be greatly surprised if Gorgias can show more good of his art
than I can show of mine.â To him again I shall say, Who are you, honest
friend, and what is your business? âI am a trainer,â he will reply,
âand my business is to make men beautiful and strong in body.â When
I have done with the trainer, there arrives the money-maker, and he, as I
expect, will utterly despise them all. âConsider Socrates,â he will
say, âwhether Gorgias or any one else can produce any greater good than
wealth.â Well, you and I say to him, and are you a creator of wealth?
âYes,â he replies. And who are you? âA money-maker.â
And do you consider wealth to be the greatest good of man? âOf
course,â will be his reply. And we shall rejoin  Yes; but our friend
Gorgias contends that his art produces a greater good than yours. And then he
will be sure to go on and ask, âWhat good? Let Gorgias answer.â Now
I want you, Gorgias, to imagine that this question is asked of you by them and
by me; What is that which, as you say, is the greatest good of man, and of
which you are the creator? Answer us.


GORGIAS  That good, Socrates, which is truly the greatest, being that which
gives to men freedom in their own persons, and to individuals the power of
ruling over others in their several states.


SOCRATES  And what would you consider this to be?


GORGIAS  What is there greater than the word which persuades the judges in the
courts, or the senators in the council, or the citizens in the assembly, or at
any other political meeting?âif you have the power of uttering this word,
you will have the physician your slave, and the trainer your slave, and the
money-maker of whom you talk will be found to gather treasures, not for
himself, but for you who are able to speak and to persuade the multitude.


SOCRATES  Now I think, Gorgias, that you have very accurately explained what
you conceive to be the art of rhetoric; and you mean to say, if I am not
mistaken, that rhetoric is the artificer of persuasion, having this and no
other business, and that this is her crown and end. Do you know any other
effect of rhetoric over and above that of producing persuasion?


GORGIAS  No  the definition seems to me very fair, Socrates; for persuasion is
the chief end of rhetoric.


SOCRATES  Then hear me, Gorgias, for I am quite sure that if there ever was a
man who entered on the discussion of a matter from a pure love of knowing the
truth, I am such a one, and I should say the same of you.


GORGIAS  What is coming, Socrates?


SOCRATES  I will tell you  I am very well aware that I do not know what,
according to you, is the exact nature, or what are the topics of that
persuasion of which you speak, and which is given by rhetoric; although I have
a suspicion about both the one and the other. And I am going to askâwhat
is this power of persuasion which is given by rhetoric, and about what? But
why, if I have a suspicion, do I ask instead of telling you? Not for your sake,
but in order that the argument may proceed in such a manner as is most likely
to set forth the truth. And I would have you observe, that I am right in asking
this further question  If I asked, âWhat sort of a painter is
Zeuxis?â and you said, âThe painter of figures,â should I not
be right in asking, âWhat kind of figures, and where do you find
them?â


GORGIAS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  And the reason for asking this second question would be, that there
are other painters besides, who paint many other figures?


GORGIAS  True.


SOCRATES  But if there had been no one but Zeuxis who painted them, then you
would have answered very well?


GORGIAS  Quite so.


SOCRATES  Now I want to know about rhetoric in the same way;âis rhetoric
the only art which brings persuasion, or do other arts have the same effect? I
mean to sayâDoes he who teaches anything persuade men of that which he
teaches or not?


GORGIAS  He persuades, Socrates,âthere can be no mistake about that.


SOCRATES  Again, if we take the arts of which we were just now
speaking âdo not arithmetic and the arithmeticians teach us the
properties of number?


GORGIAS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  And therefore persuade us of them?


GORGIAS  Yes.


SOCRATES  Then arithmetic as well as rhetoric is an artificer of persuasion?


GORGIAS  Clearly.


SOCRATES  And if any one asks us what sort of persuasion, and about
what,âwe shall answer, persuasion which teaches the quantity of odd and
even; and we shall be able to show that all the other arts of which we were
just now speaking are artificers of persuasion, and of what sort, and about
what.


GORGIAS  Very true.


SOCRATES  Then rhetoric is not the only artificer of persuasion?


GORGIAS  True.


SOCRATES  Seeing, then, that not only rhetoric works by persuasion, but that
other arts do the same, as in the case of the painter, a question has arisen
which is a very fair one  Of what persuasion is rhetoric the artificer, and
about what?âis not that a fair way of putting the question?


GORGIAS  I think so.


SOCRATES  Then, if you approve the question, Gorgias, what is the answer?


GORGIAS  I answer, Socrates, that rhetoric is the art of persuasion in courts
of law and other assemblies, as I was just now saying, and about the just and
unjust.


SOCRATES  And that, Gorgias, was what I was suspecting to be your notion; yet I
would not have you wonder if by-and-by I am found repeating a seemingly plain
question; for I ask not in order to confute you, but as I was saying that the
argument may proceed consecutively, and that we may not get the habit of
anticipating and suspecting the meaning of one anotherâs words; I would
have you develope your own views in your own way, whatever may be your
hypothesis.


GORGIAS  I think that you are quite right, Socrates.


SOCRATES  Then let me raise another question; there is such a thing as
âhaving learnedâ?


GORGIAS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And there is also âhaving believedâ?


GORGIAS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And is the âhaving learnedâ the same as âhaving
believed,â and are learning and belief the same things?


GORGIAS  In my judgment, Socrates, they are not the same.


SOCRATES  And your judgment is right, as you may ascertain in this
way âIf a person were to say to you, âIs there, Gorgias, a false
belief as well as a true?ââyou would reply, if I am not mistaken,
that there is.


GORGIAS  Yes.


SOCRATES  Well, but is there a false knowledge as well as a true?


GORGIAS  No.


SOCRATES  No, indeed; and this again proves that knowledge and belief differ.


GORGIAS  Very true.


SOCRATES  And yet those who have learned as well as those who have believed are
persuaded?


GORGIAS  Just so.


SOCRATES  Shall we then assume two sorts of persuasion,âone which is the
source of belief without knowledge, as the other is of knowledge?


GORGIAS  By all means.


SOCRATES  And which sort of persuasion does rhetoric create in courts of law
and other assemblies about the just and unjust, the sort of persuasion which
gives belief without knowledge, or that which gives knowledge?


GORGIAS  Clearly, Socrates, that which only gives belief.


SOCRATES  Then rhetoric, as would appear, is the artificer of a persuasion
which creates belief about the just and unjust, but gives no instruction about
them?


GORGIAS  True.


SOCRATES  And the rhetorician does not instruct the courts of law or other
assemblies about things just and unjust, but he creates belief about them; for
no one can be supposed to instruct such a vast multitude about such high
matters in a short time?


GORGIAS  Certainly not.


SOCRATES  Come, then, and let us see what we really mean about rhetoric; for I
do not know what my own meaning is as yet. When the assembly meets to elect a
physician or a shipwright or any other craftsman, will the rhetorician be taken
into counsel? Surely not. For at every election he ought to be chosen who is
most skilled; and, again, when walls have to be built or harbours or docks to
be constructed, not the rhetorician but the master workman will advise; or when
generals have to be chosen and an order of battle arranged, or a position
taken, then the military will advise and not the rhetoricians  what do you say,
Gorgias? Since you profess to be a rhetorician and a maker of rhetoricians, I
cannot do better than learn the nature of your art from you. And here let me
assure you that I have your interest in view as well as my own. For likely
enough some one or other of the young men present might desire to become your
pupil, and in fact I see some, and a good many too, who have this wish, but
they would be too modest to question you. And therefore when you are
interrogated by me, I would have you imagine that you are interrogated by them.
âWhat is the use of coming to you, Gorgias?â they will
sayââabout what will you teach us to advise the state?âabout
the just and unjust only, or about those other things also which Socrates has
just mentioned?â How will you answer them?


GORGIAS  I like your way of leading us on, Socrates, and I will endeavour to
reveal to you the whole nature of rhetoric. You must have heard, I think, that
the docks and the walls of the Athenians and the plan of the harbour were
devised in accordance with the counsels, partly of Themistocles, and partly of
Pericles, and not at the suggestion of the builders.


SOCRATES  Such is the tradition, Gorgias, about Themistocles; and I myself
heard the speech of Pericles when he advised us about the middle wall.


GORGIAS  And you will observe, Socrates, that when a decision has to be given
in such matters the rhetoricians are the advisers; they are the men who win
their point.


SOCRATES  I had that in my admiring mind, Gorgias, when I asked what is the
nature of rhetoric, which always appears to me, when I look at the matter in
this way, to be a marvel of greatness.


GORGIAS  A marvel, indeed, Socrates, if you only knew how rhetoric comprehends
and holds under her sway all the inferior arts. Let me offer you a striking
example of this. On several occasions I have been with my brother Herodicus or
some other physician to see one of his patients, who would not allow the
physician to give him medicine, or apply the knife or hot iron to him; and I
have persuaded him to do for me what he would not do for the physician just by
the use of rhetoric. And I say that if a rhetorician and a physician were to go
to any city, and had there to argue in the Ecclesia or any other assembly as to
which of them should be elected state-physician, the physician would have no
chance; but he who could speak would be chosen if he wished; and in a contest
with a man of any other profession the rhetorician more than any one would have
the power of getting himself chosen, for he can speak more persuasively to the
multitude than any of them, and on any subject. Such is the nature and power of
the art of rhetoric! And yet, Socrates, rhetoric should be used like any other
competitive art, not against everybody,âthe rhetorician ought not to
abuse his strength any more than a pugilist or pancratiast or other master of
fence;âbecause he has powers which are more than a match either for
friend or enemy, he ought not therefore to strike, stab, or slay his friends.
Suppose a man to have been trained in the palestra and to be a skilful
boxer,âhe in the fulness of his strength goes and strikes his father or
mother or one of his familiars or friends; but that is no reason why the
trainers or fencing-masters should be held in detestation or banished from the
city;âsurely not. For they taught their art for a good purpose, to be
used against enemies and evil-doers, in self-defence not in aggression, and
others have perverted their instructions, and turned to a bad use their own
strength and skill. But not on this account are the teachers bad, neither is
the art in fault, or bad in itself; I should rather say that those who make a
bad use of the art are to blame. And the same argument holds good of rhetoric;
for the rhetorician can speak against all men and upon any subject,âin
short, he can persuade the multitude better than any other man of anything
which he pleases, but he should not therefore seek to defraud the physician or
any other artist of his reputation merely because he has the power; he ought to
use rhetoric fairly, as he would also use his athletic powers. And if after
having become a rhetorician he makes a bad use of his strength and skill, his
instructor surely ought not on that account to be held in detestation or
banished. For he was intended by his teacher to make a good use of his
instructions, but he abuses them. And therefore he is the person who ought to
be held in detestation, banished, and put to death, and not his instructor.


SOCRATES  You, Gorgias, like myself, have had great experience of disputations,
and you must have observed, I think, that they do not always terminate in
mutual edification, or in the definition by either party of the subjects which
they are discussing; but disagreements are apt to ariseâsomebody says
that another has not spoken truly or clearly; and then they get into a passion
and begin to quarrel, both parties conceiving that their opponents are arguing
from personal feeling only and jealousy of themselves, not from any interest in
the question at issue. And sometimes they will go on abusing one another until
the company at last are quite vexed at themselves for ever listening to such
fellows. Why do I say this? Why, because I cannot help feeling that you are now
saying what is not quite consistent or accordant with what you were saying at
first about rhetoric. And I am afraid to point this out to you, lest you should
think that I have some animosity against you, and that I speak, not for the
sake of discovering the truth, but from jealousy of you. Now if you are one of
my sort, I should like to cross-examine you, but if not I will let you alone.
And what is my sort? you will ask. I am one of those who are very willing to be
refuted if I say anything which is not true, and very willing to refute any one
else who says what is not true, and quite as ready to be refuted as to refute;
for I hold that this is the greater gain of the two, just as the gain is
greater of being cured of a very great evil than of curing another. For I
imagine that there is no evil which a man can endure so great as an erroneous
opinion about the matters of which we are speaking; and if you claim to be one
of my sort, let us have the discussion out, but if you would rather have done,
no matter;âlet us make an end of it.


GORGIAS  I should say, Socrates, that I am quite the man whom you indicate;
but, perhaps, we ought to consider the audience, for, before you came, I had
already given a long exhibition, and if we proceed the argument may run on to a
great length. And therefore I think that we should consider whether we may not
be detaining some part of the company when they are wanting to do something
else.


CHAEREPHON  You hear the audience cheering, Gorgias and Socrates, which shows
their desire to listen to you; and for myself, Heaven forbid that I should have
any business on hand which would take me away from a discussion so interesting
and so ably maintained.


CALLICLES  By the gods, Chaerephon, although I have been present at many
discussions, I doubt whether I was ever so much delighted before, and therefore
if you go on discoursing all day I shall be the better pleased.


SOCRATES  I may truly say, Callicles, that I am willing, if Gorgias is.


GORGIAS  After all this, Socrates, I should be disgraced if I refused,
especially as I have promised to answer all comers; in accordance with the
wishes of the company, then, do you begin, and ask of me any question which you
like.


SOCRATES  Let me tell you then, Gorgias, what surprises me in your words;
though I dare say that you may be right, and I may have misunderstood your
meaning. You say that you can make any man, who will learn of you, a
rhetorician?


GORGIAS  Yes.


SOCRATES  Do you mean that you will teach him to gain the ears of the multitude
on any subject, and this not by instruction but by persuasion?


GORGIAS  Quite so.


SOCRATES  You were saying, in fact, that the rhetorician will have greater
powers of persuasion than the physician even in a matter of health?


GORGIAS  Yes, with the multitude,âthat is.


SOCRATES  You mean to say, with the ignorant; for with those who know he cannot
be supposed to have greater powers of persuasion.


GORGIAS  Very true.


SOCRATES  But if he is to have more power of persuasion than the physician, he
will have greater power than he who knows?


GORGIAS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  Although he is not a physician âis he?


GORGIAS  No.


SOCRATES  And he who is not a physician must, obviously, be ignorant of what
the physician knows.


GORGIAS  Clearly.


SOCRATES  Then, when the rhetorician is more persuasive than the physician, the
ignorant is more persuasive with the ignorant than he who has
knowledge?âis not that the inference?


GORGIAS  In the case supposed âyes.


SOCRATES  And the same holds of the relation of rhetoric to all the other arts;
the rhetorician need not know the truth about things; he has only to discover
some way of persuading the ignorant that he has more knowledge than those who
know?


GORGIAS  Yes, Socrates, and is not this a great comfort?ânot to have
learned the other arts, but the art of rhetoric only, and yet to be in no way
inferior to the professors of them?


SOCRATES  Whether the rhetorician is or not inferior on this account is a
question which we will hereafter examine if the enquiry is likely to be of any
service to us; but I would rather begin by asking, whether he is or is not as
ignorant of the just and unjust, base and honourable, good and evil, as he is
of medicine and the other arts; I mean to say, does he really know anything of
what is good and evil, base or honourable, just or unjust in them; or has he
only a way with the ignorant of persuading them that he not knowing is to be
esteemed to know more about these things than some one else who knows? Or must
the pupil know these things and come to you knowing them before he can acquire
the art of rhetoric? If he is ignorant, you who are the teacher of rhetoric
will not teach himâit is not your business; but you will make him seem to
the multitude to know them, when he does not know them; and seem to be a good
man, when he is not. Or will you be unable to teach him rhetoric at all, unless
he knows the truth of these things first? What is to be said about all this? By
heavens, Gorgias, I wish that you would reveal to me the power of rhetoric, as
you were saying that you would.


GORGIAS  Well, Socrates, I suppose that if the pupil does chance not to know
them, he will have to learn of me these things as well.


SOCRATES  Say no more, for there you are right; and so he whom you make a
rhetorician must either know the nature of the just and unjust already, or he
must be taught by you.


GORGIAS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  Well, and is not he who has learned carpentering a carpenter?


GORGIAS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And he who has learned music a musician?


GORGIAS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And he who has learned medicine is a physician, in like manner? He
who has learned anything whatever is that which his knowledge makes him.


GORGIAS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  And in the same way, he who has learned what is just is just?


GORGIAS  To be sure.


SOCRATES  And he who is just may be supposed to do what is just?


GORGIAS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And must not the just man always desire to do what is just?


GORGIAS  That is clearly the inference.


SOCRATES  Surely, then, the just man will never consent to do injustice?


GORGIAS  Certainly not.


SOCRATES  And according to the argument the rhetorician must be a just man?


GORGIAS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And will therefore never be willing to do injustice?


GORGIAS  Clearly not.


SOCRATES  But do you remember saying just now that the trainer is not to be
accused or banished if the pugilist makes a wrong use of his pugilistic art;
and in like manner, if the rhetorician makes a bad and unjust use of his
rhetoric, that is not to be laid to the charge of his teacher, who is not to be
banished, but the wrong-doer himself who made a bad use of his
rhetoricâhe is to be banishedâwas not that said?


GORGIAS  Yes, it was.


SOCRATES  But now we are affirming that the aforesaid rhetorician will never
have done injustice at all?


GORGIAS  True.


SOCRATES  And at the very outset, Gorgias, it was said that rhetoric treated of
discourse, not (like arithmetic) about odd and even, but about just and unjust?
Was not this said?


GORGIAS  Yes.


SOCRATES  I was thinking at the time, when I heard you saying so, that
rhetoric, which is always discoursing about justice, could not possibly be an
unjust thing. But when you added, shortly afterwards, that the rhetorician
might make a bad use of rhetoric I noted with surprise the inconsistency into
which you had fallen; and I said, that if you thought, as I did, that there was
a gain in being refuted, there would be an advantage in going on with the
question, but if not, I would leave off. And in the course of our
investigations, as you will see yourself, the rhetorician has been acknowledged
to be incapable of making an unjust use of rhetoric, or of willingness to do
injustice. By the dog, Gorgias, there will be a great deal of discussion,
before we get at the truth of all this.


POLUS  And do even you, Socrates, seriously believe what you are now saying
about rhetoric? What! because Gorgias was ashamed to deny that the rhetorician
knew the just and the honourable and the good, and admitted that to any one who
came to him ignorant of them he could teach them, and then out of this
admission there arose a contradictionâthe thing which you dearly love,
and to which not he, but you, brought the argument by your captious
questionsâ(do you seriously believe that there is any truth in all this?)
For will any one ever acknowledge that he does not know, or cannot teach, the
nature of justice? The truth is, that there is great want of manners in
bringing the argument to such a pass.


SOCRATES  Illustrious Polus, the reason why we provide ourselves with friends
and children is, that when we get old and stumble, a younger generation may be
at hand to set us on our legs again in our words and in our actions  and now,
if I and Gorgias are stumbling, here are you who should raise us up; and I for
my part engage to retract any error into which you may think that I have
fallen-upon one condition 


POLUS  What condition?


SOCRATES  That you contract, Polus, the prolixity of speech in which you
indulged at first.


POLUS  What! do you mean that I may not use as many words as I please?


SOCRATES  Only to think, my friend, that having come on a visit to Athens,
which is the most free-spoken state in Hellas, you when you got there, and you
alone, should be deprived of the power of speechâthat would be hard
indeed. But then consider my case âshall not I be very hardly used, if,
when you are making a long oration, and refusing to answer what you are asked,
I am compelled to stay and listen to you, and may not go away? I say rather, if
you have a real interest in the argument, or, to repeat my former expression,
have any desire to set it on its legs, take back any statement which you
please; and in your turn ask and answer, like myself and Gorgiasârefute
and be refuted  for I suppose that you would claim to know what Gorgias
knowsâwould you not?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And you, like him, invite any one to ask you about anything which he
pleases, and you will know how to answer him?


POLUS  To be sure.


SOCRATES  And now, which will you do, ask or answer?


POLUS  I will ask; and do you answer me, Socrates, the same question which
Gorgias, as you suppose, is unable to answer  What is rhetoric?


SOCRATES  Do you mean what sort of an art?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  To say the truth, Polus, it is not an art at all, in my opinion.


POLUS  Then what, in your opinion, is rhetoric?


SOCRATES  A thing which, as I was lately reading in a book of yours, you say
that you have made an art.


POLUS  What thing?


SOCRATES  I should say a sort of experience.


POLUS  Does rhetoric seem to you to be an experience?


SOCRATES  That is my view, but you may be of another mind.


POLUS  An experience in what?


SOCRATES  An experience in producing a sort of delight and gratification.


POLUS  And if able to gratify others, must not rhetoric be a fine thing?


SOCRATES  What are you saying, Polus? Why do you ask me whether rhetoric is a
fine thing or not, when I have not as yet told you what rhetoric is?


POLUS  Did I not hear you say that rhetoric was a sort of experience?


SOCRATES  Will you, who are so desirous to gratify others, afford a slight
gratification to me?


POLUS  I will.


SOCRATES  Will you ask me, what sort of an art is cookery?


POLUS  What sort of an art is cookery?


SOCRATES  Not an art at all, Polus.


POLUS  What then?


SOCRATES  I should say an experience.


POLUS  In what? I wish that you would explain to me.


SOCRATES  An experience in producing a sort of delight and gratification,
Polus.


POLUS  Then are cookery and rhetoric the same?


SOCRATES  No, they are only different parts of the same profession.


POLUS  Of what profession?


SOCRATES  I am afraid that the truth may seem discourteous; and I hesitate to
answer, lest Gorgias should imagine that I am making fun of his own profession.
For whether or not this is that art of rhetoric which Gorgias practises I
really cannot tell âfrom what he was just now saying, nothing appeared of
what he thought of his art, but the rhetoric which I mean is a part of a not
very creditable whole.


GORGIAS  A part of what, Socrates? Say what you mean, and never mind me.


SOCRATES  In my opinion then, Gorgias, the whole of which rhetoric is a part is
not an art at all, but the habit of a bold and ready wit, which knows how to
manage mankind  this habit I sum up under the word âflatteryâ; and
it appears to me to have many other parts, one of which is cookery, which may
seem to be an art, but, as I maintain, is only an experience or routine and not
an art âanother part is rhetoric, and the art of attiring and sophistry
are two others  thus there are four branches, and four different things
answering to them. And Polus may ask, if he likes, for he has not as yet been
informed, what part of flattery is rhetoric  he did not see that I had not yet
answered him when he proceeded to ask a further question  Whether I do not
think rhetoric a fine thing? But I shall not tell him whether rhetoric is a
fine thing or not, until I have first answered, âWhat is rhetoric?â
For that would not be right, Polus; but I shall be happy to answer, if you will
ask me, What part of flattery is rhetoric?


POLUS  I will ask and do you answer? What part of flattery is rhetoric?


SOCRATES  Will you understand my answer? Rhetoric, according to my view, is the
ghost or counterfeit of a part of politics.


POLUS  And noble or ignoble?


SOCRATES  Ignoble, I should say, if I am compelled to answer, for I call what
is bad ignoble  though I doubt whether you understand what I was saying before.


GORGIAS  Indeed, Socrates, I cannot say that I understand myself.


SOCRATES  I do not wonder, Gorgias; for I have not as yet explained myself, and
our friend Polus, colt by name and colt by nature, is apt to run away. (This is
an untranslatable play on the name âPolus,â which means âa
colt.â)


GORGIAS  Never mind him, but explain to me what you mean by saying that
rhetoric is the counterfeit of a part of politics.


SOCRATES  I will try, then, to explain my notion of rhetoric, and if I am
mistaken, my friend Polus shall refute me. We may assume the existence of
bodies and of souls?


GORGIAS  Of course.


SOCRATES  You would further admit that there is a good condition of either of
them?


GORGIAS  Yes.


SOCRATES  Which condition may not be really good, but good only in appearance?
I mean to say, that there are many persons who appear to be in good health, and
whom only a physician or trainer will discern at first sight not to be in good
health.


GORGIAS  True.


SOCRATES  And this applies not only to the body, but also to the soul  in
either there may be that which gives the appearance of health and not the
reality?


GORGIAS  Yes, certainly.


SOCRATES  And now I will endeavour to explain to you more clearly what I mean 
The soul and body being two, have two arts corresponding to them  there is the
art of politics attending on the soul; and another art attending on the body,
of which I know no single name, but which may be described as having two
divisions, one of them gymnastic, and the other medicine. And in politics there
is a legislative part, which answers to gymnastic, as justice does to medicine;
and the two parts run into one another, justice having to do with the same
subject as legislation, and medicine with the same subject as gymnastic, but
with a difference. Now, seeing that there are these four arts, two attending on
the body and two on the soul for their highest good; flattery knowing, or
rather guessing their natures, has distributed herself into four shams or
simulations of them; she puts on the likeness of some one or other of them, and
pretends to be that which she simulates, and having no regard for menâs
highest interests, is ever making pleasure the bait of the unwary, and
deceiving them into the belief that she is of the highest value to them.
Cookery simulates the disguise of medicine, and pretends to know what food is
the best for the body; and if the physician and the cook had to enter into a
competition in which children were the judges, or men who had no more sense
than children, as to which of them best understands the goodness or badness of
food, the physician would be starved to death. A flattery I deem this to be and
of an ignoble sort, Polus, for to you I am now addressing myself, because it
aims at pleasure without any thought of the best. An art I do not call it, but
only an experience, because it is unable to explain or to give a reason of the
nature of its own applications. And I do not call any irrational thing an art;
but if you dispute my words, I am prepared to argue in defence of them.


Cookery, then, I maintain to be a flattery which takes the form of medicine;
and tiring, in like manner, is a flattery which takes the form of gymnastic,
and is knavish, false, ignoble, illiberal, working deceitfully by the help of
lines, and colours, and enamels, and garments, and making men affect a spurious
beauty to the neglect of the true beauty which is given by gymnastic.


I would rather not be tedious, and therefore I will only say, after the manner
of the geometricians (for I think that by this time you will be able to follow)


as tiring  gymnastic   cookery  medicine;


or rather,


as tiring  gymnastic   sophistry  legislation;


and


as cookery  medicine   rhetoric  justice.


And this, I say, is the natural difference between the rhetorician and the
sophist, but by reason of their near connection, they are apt to be jumbled up
together; neither do they know what to make of themselves, nor do other men
know what to make of them. For if the body presided over itself, and were not
under the guidance of the soul, and the soul did not discern and discriminate
between cookery and medicine, but the body was made the judge of them, and the
rule of judgment was the bodily delight which was given by them, then the word
of Anaxagoras, that word with which you, friend Polus, are so well acquainted,
would prevail far and wide  âChaosâ would come again, and cookery,
health, and medicine would mingle in an indiscriminate mass. And now I have
told you my notion of rhetoric, which is, in relation to the soul, what cookery
is to the body. I may have been inconsistent in making a long speech, when I
would not allow you to discourse at length. But I think that I may be excused,
because you did not understand me, and could make no use of my answer when I
spoke shortly, and therefore I had to enter into an explanation. And if I show
an equal inability to make use of yours, I hope that you will speak at equal
length; but if I am able to understand you, let me have the benefit of your
brevity, as is only fair  And now you may do what you please with my answer.


POLUS  What do you mean? do you think that rhetoric is flattery?


SOCRATES  Nay, I said a part of flattery; if at your age, Polus, you cannot
remember, what will you do by-and-by, when you get older?


POLUS  And are the good rhetoricians meanly regarded in states, under the idea
that they are flatterers?


SOCRATES  Is that a question or the beginning of a speech?


POLUS  I am asking a question.


SOCRATES  Then my answer is, that they are not regarded at all.


POLUS  How not regarded? Have they not very great power in states?


SOCRATES  Not if you mean to say that power is a good to the possessor.


POLUS  And that is what I do mean to say.


SOCRATES  Then, if so, I think that they have the least power of all the
citizens.


POLUS  What! are they not like tyrants? They kill and despoil and exile any one
whom they please.


SOCRATES  By the dog, Polus, I cannot make out at each deliverance of yours,
whether you are giving an opinion of your own, or asking a question of me.


POLUS  I am asking a question of you.


SOCRATES  Yes, my friend, but you ask two questions at once.


POLUS  How two questions?


SOCRATES  Why, did you not say just now that the rhetoricians are like tyrants,
and that they kill and despoil or exile any one whom they please?


POLUS  I did.


SOCRATES  Well then, I say to you that here are two questions in one, and I
will answer both of them. And I tell you, Polus, that rhetoricians and tyrants
have the least possible power in states, as I was just now saying; for they do
literally nothing which they will, but only what they think best.


POLUS  And is not that a great power?


SOCRATES  Polus has already said the reverse.


POLUS  Said the reverse! nay, that is what I assert.


SOCRATES  No, by the greatâwhat do you call him?ânot you, for you
say that power is a good to him who has the power.


POLUS  I do.


SOCRATES  And would you maintain that if a fool does what he thinks best, this
is a good, and would you call this great power?


POLUS  I should not.


SOCRATES  Then you must prove that the rhetorician is not a fool, and that
rhetoric is an art and not a flatteryâand so you will have refuted me;
but if you leave me unrefuted, why, the rhetoricians who do what they think
best in states, and the tyrants, will have nothing upon which to congratulate
themselves, if as you say, power be indeed a good, admitting at the same time
that what is done without sense is an evil.


POLUS  Yes; I admit that.


SOCRATES  How then can the rhetoricians or the tyrants have great power in
states, unless Polus can refute Socrates, and prove to him that they do as they
will?


POLUS  This fellowâ


SOCRATES  I say that they do not do as they will;ânow refute me.


POLUS  Why, have you not already said that they do as they think best?


SOCRATES  And I say so still.


POLUS  Then surely they do as they will?


SOCRATES  I deny it.


POLUS  But they do what they think best?


SOCRATES  Aye.


POLUS  That, Socrates, is monstrous and absurd.


SOCRATES  Good words, good Polus, as I may say in your own peculiar style; but
if you have any questions to ask of me, either prove that I am in error or give
the answer yourself.


POLUS  Very well, I am willing to answer that I may know what you mean.


SOCRATES  Do men appear to you to will that which they do, or to will that
further end for the sake of which they do a thing? when they take medicine, for
example, at the bidding of a physician, do they will the drinking of the
medicine which is painful, or the health for the sake of which they drink?


POLUS  Clearly, the health.


SOCRATES  And when men go on a voyage or engage in business, they do not will
that which they are doing at the time; for who would desire to take the risk of
a voyage or the trouble of business?âBut they will, to have the wealth
for the sake of which they go on a voyage.


POLUS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  And is not this universally true? If a man does something for the
sake of something else, he wills not that which he does, but that for the sake
of which he does it.


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And are not all things either good or evil, or intermediate and
indifferent?


POLUS  To be sure, Socrates.


SOCRATES  Wisdom and health and wealth and the like you would call goods, and
their opposites evils?


POLUS  I should.


SOCRATES  And the things which are neither good nor evil, and which partake
sometimes of the nature of good and at other times of evil, or of neither, are
such as sitting, walking, running, sailing; or, again, wood, stones, and the
like âthese are the things which you call neither good nor evil?


POLUS  Exactly so.


SOCRATES  Are these indifferent things done for the sake of the good, or the
good for the sake of the indifferent?


POLUS  Clearly, the indifferent for the sake of the good.


SOCRATES  When we walk we walk for the sake of the good, and under the idea
that it is better to walk, and when we stand we stand equally for the sake of
the good?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And when we kill a man we kill him or exile him or despoil him of his
goods, because, as we think, it will conduce to our good?


POLUS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  Men who do any of these things do them for the sake of the good?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And did we not admit that in doing something for the sake of
something else, we do not will those things which we do, but that other thing
for the sake of which we do them?


POLUS  Most true.


SOCRATES  Then we do not will simply to kill a man or to exile him or to
despoil him of his goods, but we will to do that which conduces to our good,
and if the act is not conducive to our good we do not will it; for we will, as
you say, that which is our good, but that which is neither good nor evil, or
simply evil, we do not will. Why are you silent, Polus? Am I not right?


POLUS  You are right.


SOCRATES  Hence we may infer, that if any one, whether he be a tyrant or a
rhetorician, kills another or exiles another or deprives him of his property,
under the idea that the act is for his own interests when really not for his
own interests, he may be said to do what seems best to him?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  But does he do what he wills if he does what is evil? Why do you not
answer?


POLUS  Well, I suppose not.


SOCRATES  Then if great power is a good as you allow, will such a one have
great power in a state?


POLUS  He will not.


SOCRATES  Then I was right in saying that a man may do what seems good to him
in a state, and not have great power, and not do what he wills?


POLUS  As though you, Socrates, would not like to have the power of doing what
seemed good to you in the state, rather than not; you would not be jealous when
you saw any one killing or despoiling or imprisoning whom he pleased, Oh, no!


SOCRATES  Justly or unjustly, do you mean?


POLUS  In either case is he not equally to be envied?


SOCRATES  Forbear, Polus!


POLUS  Why âforbearâ?


SOCRATES  Because you ought not to envy wretches who are not to be envied, but
only to pity them.


POLUS  And are those of whom I spoke wretches?


SOCRATES  Yes, certainly they are.


POLUS  And so you think that he who slays any one whom he pleases, and justly
slays him, is pitiable and wretched?


SOCRATES  No, I do not say that of him  but neither do I think that he is to be
envied.


POLUS  Were you not saying just now that he is wretched?


SOCRATES  Yes, my friend, if he killed another unjustly, in which case he is
also to be pitied; and he is not to be envied if he killed him justly.


POLUS  At any rate you will allow that he who is unjustly put to death is
wretched, and to be pitied?


SOCRATES  Not so much, Polus, as he who kills him, and not so much as he who is
justly killed.


POLUS  How can that be, Socrates?


SOCRATES  That may very well be, inasmuch as doing injustice is the greatest of
evils.


POLUS  But is it the greatest? Is not suffering injustice a greater evil?


SOCRATES  Certainly not.


POLUS  Then would you rather suffer than do injustice?


SOCRATES  I should not like either, but if I must choose between them, I would
rather suffer than do.


POLUS  Then you would not wish to be a tyrant?


SOCRATES  Not if you mean by tyranny what I mean.


POLUS  I mean, as I said before, the power of doing whatever seems good to you
in a state, killing, banishing, doing in all things as you like.


SOCRATES  Well then, illustrious friend, when I have said my say, do you reply
to me. Suppose that I go into a crowded Agora, and take a dagger under my arm.
Polus, I say to you, I have just acquired rare power, and become a tyrant; for
if I think that any of these men whom you see ought to be put to death, the man
whom I have a mind to kill is as good as dead; and if I am disposed to break
his head or tear his garment, he will have his head broken or his garment torn
in an instant. Such is my great power in this city. And if you do not believe
me, and I show you the dagger, you would probably reply  Socrates, in that sort
of way any one may have great powerâhe may burn any house which he
pleases, and the docks and triremes of the Athenians, and all their other
vessels, whether public or privateâbut can you believe that this mere
doing as you think best is great power?


POLUS  Certainly not such doing as this.


SOCRATES  But can you tell me why you disapprove of such a power?


POLUS  I can.


SOCRATES  Why then?


POLUS  Why, because he who did as you say would be certain to be punished.


SOCRATES  And punishment is an evil?


POLUS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  And you would admit once more, my good sir, that great power is a
benefit to a man if his actions turn out to his advantage, and that this is the
meaning of great power; and if not, then his power is an evil and is no power.
But let us look at the matter in another way âdo we not acknowledge that
the things of which we were speaking, the infliction of death, and exile, and
the deprivation of property are sometimes a good and sometimes not a good?


POLUS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  About that you and I may be supposed to agree?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  Tell me, then, when do you say that they are good and when that they
are evilâwhat principle do you lay down?


POLUS  I would rather, Socrates, that you should answer as well as ask that
question.


SOCRATES  Well, Polus, since you would rather have the answer from me, I say
that they are good when they are just, and evil when they are unjust.


POLUS  You are hard of refutation, Socrates, but might not a child refute that
statement?


SOCRATES  Then I shall be very grateful to the child, and equally grateful to
you if you will refute me and deliver me from my foolishness. And I hope that
refute me you will, and not weary of doing good to a friend.


POLUS  Yes, Socrates, and I need not go far or appeal to antiquity; events
which happened only a few days ago are enough to refute you, and to prove that
many men who do wrong are happy.


SOCRATES  What events?


POLUS  You see, I presume, that Archelaus the son of Perdiccas is now the ruler
of Macedonia?


SOCRATES  At any rate I hear that he is.


POLUS  And do you think that he is happy or miserable?


SOCRATES  I cannot say, Polus, for I have never had any acquaintance with him.


POLUS  And cannot you tell at once, and without having an acquaintance with
him, whether a man is happy?


SOCRATES  Most certainly not.


POLUS  Then clearly, Socrates, you would say that you did not even know whether
the great king was a happy man?


SOCRATES  And I should speak the truth; for I do not know how he stands in the
matter of education and justice.


POLUS  What! and does all happiness consist in this?


SOCRATES  Yes, indeed, Polus, that is my doctrine; the men and women who are
gentle and good are also happy, as I maintain, and the unjust and evil are
miserable.


POLUS  Then, according to your doctrine, the said Archelaus is miserable?


SOCRATES  Yes, my friend, if he is wicked.


POLUS  That he is wicked I cannot deny; for he had no title at all to the
throne which he now occupies, he being only the son of a woman who was the
slave of Alcetas the brother of Perdiccas; he himself therefore in strict right
was the slave of Alcetas; and if he had meant to do rightly he would have
remained his slave, and then, according to your doctrine, he would have been
happy. But now he is unspeakably miserable, for he has been guilty of the
greatest crimes  in the first place he invited his uncle and master, Alcetas,
to come to him, under the pretence that he would restore to him the throne
which Perdiccas has usurped, and after entertaining him and his son Alexander,
who was his own cousin, and nearly of an age with him, and making them drunk,
he threw them into a waggon and carried them off by night, and slew them, and
got both of them out of the way; and when he had done all this wickedness he
never discovered that he was the most miserable of all men, and was very far
from repenting  shall I tell you how he showed his remorse? he had a younger
brother, a child of seven years old, who was the legitimate son of Perdiccas,
and to him of right the kingdom belonged; Archelaus, however, had no mind to
bring him up as he ought and restore the kingdom to him; that was not his
notion of happiness; but not long afterwards he threw him into a well and
drowned him, and declared to his mother Cleopatra that he had fallen in while
running after a goose, and had been killed. And now as he is the greatest
criminal of all the Macedonians, he may be supposed to be the most miserable
and not the happiest of them, and I dare say that there are many Athenians, and
you would be at the head of them, who would rather be any other Macedonian than
Archelaus!


SOCRATES  I praised you at first, Polus, for being a rhetorician rather than a
reasoner. And this, as I suppose, is the sort of argument with which you fancy
that a child might refute me, and by which I stand refuted when I say that the
unjust man is not happy. But, my good friend, where is the refutation? I cannot
admit a word which you have been saying.


POLUS  That is because you will not; for you surely must think as I do.


SOCRATES  Not so, my simple friend, but because you will refute me after the
manner which rhetoricians practise in courts of law. For there the one party
think that they refute the other when they bring forward a number of witnesses
of good repute in proof of their allegations, and their adversary has only a
single one or none at all. But this kind of proof is of no value where truth is
the aim; a man may often be sworn down by a multitude of false witnesses who
have a great air of respectability. And in this argument nearly every one,
Athenian and stranger alike, would be on your side, if you should bring
witnesses in disproof of my statement;âyou may, if you will, summon
Nicias the son of Niceratus, and let his brothers, who gave the row of tripods
which stand in the precincts of Dionysus, come with him; or you may summon
Aristocrates, the son of Scellius, who is the giver of that famous offering
which is at Delphi; summon, if you will, the whole house of Pericles, or any
other great Athenian family whom you choose;âthey will all agree with
you  I only am left alone and cannot agree, for you do not convince me;
although you produce many false witnesses against me, in the hope of depriving
me of my inheritance, which is the truth. But I consider that nothing worth
speaking of will have been effected by me unless I make you the one witness of
my words; nor by you, unless you make me the one witness of yours; no matter
about the rest of the world. For there are two ways of refutation, one which is
yours and that of the world in general; but mine is of another sortâlet
us compare them, and see in what they differ. For, indeed, we are at issue
about matters which to know is honourable and not to know disgraceful; to know
or not to know happiness and miseryâthat is the chief of them. And what
knowledge can be nobler? or what ignorance more disgraceful than this? And
therefore I will begin by asking you whether you do not think that a man who is
unjust and doing injustice can be happy, seeing that you think Archelaus
unjust, and yet happy? May I assume this to be your opinion?


POLUS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  But I say that this is an impossibilityâhere is one point about
which we are at issue âvery good. And do you mean to say also that if he
meets with retribution and punishment he will still be happy?


POLUS  Certainly not; in that case he will be most miserable.


SOCRATES  On the other hand, if the unjust be not punished, then, according to
you, he will be happy?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  But in my opinion, Polus, the unjust or doer of unjust actions is
miserable in any case,âmore miserable, however, if he be not punished and
does not meet with retribution, and less miserable if he be punished and meets
with retribution at the hands of gods and men.


POLUS  You are maintaining a strange doctrine, Socrates.


SOCRATES  I shall try to make you agree with me, O my friend, for as a friend I
regard you. Then these are the points at issue between usâare they not? I
was saying that to do is worse than to suffer injustice?


POLUS  Exactly so.


SOCRATES  And you said the opposite?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  I said also that the wicked are miserable, and you refuted me?


POLUS  By Zeus, I did.


SOCRATES  In your own opinion, Polus.


POLUS  Yes, and I rather suspect that I was in the right.


SOCRATES  You further said that the wrong-doer is happy if he be unpunished?


POLUS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  And I affirm that he is most miserable, and that those who are
punished are less miserableâare you going to refute this proposition
also?


POLUS  A proposition which is harder of refutation than the other, Socrates.


SOCRATES  Say rather, Polus, impossible; for who can refute the truth?


POLUS  What do you mean? If a man is detected in an unjust attempt to make
himself a tyrant, and when detected is racked, mutilated, has his eyes burned
out, and after having had all sorts of great injuries inflicted on him, and
having seen his wife and children suffer the like, is at last impaled or tarred
and burned alive, will he be happier than if he escape and become a tyrant, and
continue all through life doing what he likes and holding the reins of
government, the envy and admiration both of citizens and strangers? Is that the
paradox which, as you say, cannot be refuted?


SOCRATES  There again, noble Polus, you are raising hobgoblins instead of
refuting me; just now you were calling witnesses against me. But please to
refresh my memory a little; did you sayââin an unjust attempt to
make himself a tyrantâ?


POLUS  Yes, I did.


SOCRATES  Then I say that neither of them will be happier than the
other,âneither he who unjustly acquires a tyranny, nor he who suffers in
the attempt, for of two miserables one cannot be the happier, but that he who
escapes and becomes a tyrant is the more miserable of the two. Do you laugh,
Polus? Well, this is a new kind of refutation,âwhen any one says
anything, instead of refuting him to laugh at him.


POLUS  But do you not think, Socrates, that you have been sufficiently refuted,
when you say that which no human being will allow? Ask the company.


SOCRATES  O Polus, I am not a public man, and only last year, when my tribe
were serving as Prytanes, and it became my duty as their president to take the
votes, there was a laugh at me, because I was unable to take them. And as I
failed then, you must not ask me to count the suffrages of the company now; but
if, as I was saying, you have no better argument than numbers, let me have a
turn, and do you make trial of the sort of proof which, as I think, is
required; for I shall produce one witness only of the truth of my words, and he
is the person with whom I am arguing; his suffrage I know how to take; but with
the many I have nothing to do, and do not even address myself to them. May I
ask then whether you will answer in turn and have your words put to the proof?
For I certainly think that I and you and every man do really believe, that to
do is a greater evil than to suffer injustice  and not to be punished than to
be punished.


POLUS  And I should say neither I, nor any man  would you yourself, for
example, suffer rather than do injustice?


SOCRATES  Yes, and you, too; I or any man would.


POLUS  Quite the reverse; neither you, nor I, nor any man.


SOCRATES  But will you answer?


POLUS  To be sure, I will; for I am curious to hear what you can have to say.


SOCRATES  Tell me, then, and you will know, and let us suppose that I am
beginning at the beginning  which of the two, Polus, in your opinion, is the
worst?âto do injustice or to suffer?


POLUS  I should say that suffering was worst.


SOCRATES  And which is the greater disgrace?âAnswer.


POLUS  To do.


SOCRATES  And the greater disgrace is the greater evil?


POLUS  Certainly not.


SOCRATES  I understand you to say, if I am not mistaken, that the honourable is
not the same as the good, or the disgraceful as the evil?


POLUS  Certainly not.


SOCRATES  Let me ask a question of you  When you speak of beautiful things,
such as bodies, colours, figures, sounds, institutions, do you not call them
beautiful in reference to some standard  bodies, for example, are beautiful in
proportion as they are useful, or as the sight of them gives pleasure to the
spectators; can you give any other account of personal beauty?


POLUS  I cannot.


SOCRATES  And you would say of figures or colours generally that they were
beautiful, either by reason of the pleasure which they give, or of their use,
or of both?


POLUS  Yes, I should.


SOCRATES  And you would call sounds and music beautiful for the same reason?


POLUS  I should.


SOCRATES  Laws and institutions also have no beauty in them except in so far as
they are useful or pleasant or both?


POLUS  I think not.


SOCRATES  And may not the same be said of the beauty of knowledge?


POLUS  To be sure, Socrates; and I very much approve of your measuring beauty
by the standard of pleasure and utility.


SOCRATES  And deformity or disgrace may be equally measured by the opposite
standard of pain and evil?


POLUS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  Then when of two beautiful things one exceeds in beauty, the measure
of the excess is to be taken in one or both of these; that is to say, in
pleasure or utility or both?


POLUS  Very true.


SOCRATES  And of two deformed things, that which exceeds in deformity or
disgrace, exceeds either in pain or evilâmust it not be so?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  But then again, what was the observation which you just now made,
about doing and suffering wrong? Did you not say, that suffering wrong was more
evil, and doing wrong more disgraceful?


POLUS  I did.


SOCRATES  Then, if doing wrong is more disgraceful than suffering, the more
disgraceful must be more painful and must exceed in pain or in evil or both 
does not that also follow?


POLUS  Of course.


SOCRATES  First, then, let us consider whether the doing of injustice exceeds
the suffering in the consequent pain  Do the injurers suffer more than the
injured?


POLUS  No, Socrates; certainly not.


SOCRATES  Then they do not exceed in pain?


POLUS  No.


SOCRATES  But if not in pain, then not in both?


POLUS  Certainly not.


SOCRATES  Then they can only exceed in the other?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  That is to say, in evil?


POLUS  True.


SOCRATES  Then doing injustice will have an excess of evil, and will therefore
be a greater evil than suffering injustice?


POLUS  Clearly.


SOCRATES  But have not you and the world already agreed that to do injustice is
more disgraceful than to suffer?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And that is now discovered to be more evil?


POLUS  True.


SOCRATES  And would you prefer a greater evil or a greater dishonour to a less
one? Answer, Polus, and fear not; for you will come to no harm if you nobly
resign yourself into the healing hand of the argument as to a physician without
shrinking, and either say âYesâ or âNoâ to me.


POLUS  I should say âNo.â


SOCRATES  Would any other man prefer a greater to a less evil?


POLUS  No, not according to this way of putting the case, Socrates.


SOCRATES  Then I said truly, Polus, that neither you, nor I, nor any man, would
rather do than suffer injustice; for to do injustice is the greater evil of the
two.


POLUS  That is the conclusion.


SOCRATES  You see, Polus, when you compare the two kinds of refutations, how
unlike they are. All men, with the exception of myself, are of your way of
thinking; but your single assent and witness are enough for me,âI have no
need of any other, I take your suffrage, and am regardless of the rest. Enough
of this, and now let us proceed to the next question; which is, Whether the
greatest of evils to a guilty man is to suffer punishment, as you supposed, or
whether to escape punishment is not a greater evil, as I supposed.
Consider âYou would say that to suffer punishment is another name for
being justly corrected when you do wrong?


POLUS  I should.


SOCRATES  And would you not allow that all just things are honourable in so far
as they are just? Please to reflect, and tell me your opinion.


POLUS  Yes, Socrates, I think that they are.


SOCRATES  Consider again âWhere there is an agent, must there not also be
a patient?


POLUS  I should say so.


SOCRATES  And will not the patient suffer that which the agent does, and will
not the suffering have the quality of the action? I mean, for example, that if
a man strikes, there must be something which is stricken?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And if the striker strikes violently or quickly, that which is struck
will be struck violently or quickly?


POLUS  True.


SOCRATES  And the suffering to him who is stricken is of the same nature as the
act of him who strikes?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And if a man burns, there is something which is burned?


POLUS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  And if he burns in excess or so as to cause pain, the thing burned
will be burned in the same way?


POLUS  Truly.


SOCRATES  And if he cuts, the same argument holdsâthere will be something
cut?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And if the cutting be great or deep or such as will cause pain, the
cut will be of the same nature?


POLUS  That is evident.


SOCRATES  Then you would agree generally to the universal proposition which I
was just now asserting  that the affection of the patient answers to the
affection of the agent?


POLUS  I agree.


SOCRATES  Then, as this is admitted, let me ask whether being punished is
suffering or acting?


POLUS  Suffering, Socrates; there can be no doubt of that.


SOCRATES  And suffering implies an agent?


POLUS  Certainly, Socrates; and he is the punisher.


SOCRATES  And he who punishes rightly, punishes justly?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And therefore he acts justly?


POLUS  Justly.


SOCRATES  Then he who is punished and suffers retribution, suffers justly?


POLUS  That is evident.


SOCRATES  And that which is just has been admitted to be honourable?


POLUS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  Then the punisher does what is honourable, and the punished suffers
what is honourable?


POLUS  True.


SOCRATES  And if what is honourable, then what is good, for the honourable is
either pleasant or useful?


POLUS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  Then he who is punished suffers what is good?


POLUS  That is true.


SOCRATES  Then he is benefited?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  Do I understand you to mean what I mean by the term
âbenefitedâ? I mean, that if he be justly punished his soul is
improved.


POLUS  Surely.


SOCRATES  Then he who is punished is delivered from the evil of his soul?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And is he not then delivered from the greatest evil? Look at the
matter in this way âIn respect of a manâs estate, do you see any
greater evil than poverty?


POLUS  There is no greater evil.


SOCRATES  Again, in a manâs bodily frame, you would say that the evil is
weakness and disease and deformity?


POLUS  I should.


SOCRATES  And do you not imagine that the soul likewise has some evil of her
own?


POLUS  Of course.


SOCRATES  And this you would call injustice and ignorance and cowardice, and
the like?


POLUS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  So then, in mind, body, and estate, which are three, you have pointed
out three corresponding evilsâinjustice, disease, poverty?


POLUS  True.


SOCRATES  And which of the evils is the most disgraceful?âIs not the most
disgraceful of them injustice, and in general the evil of the soul?


POLUS  By far the most.


SOCRATES  And if the most disgraceful, then also the worst?


POLUS  What do you mean, Socrates?


SOCRATES  I mean to say, that is most disgraceful has been already admitted to
be most painful or hurtful, or both.


POLUS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  And now injustice and all evil in the soul has been admitted by us to
be most disgraceful?


POLUS  It has been admitted.


SOCRATES  And most disgraceful either because most painful and causing
excessive pain, or most hurtful, or both?


POLUS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  And therefore to be unjust and intemperate, and cowardly and
ignorant, is more painful than to be poor and sick?


POLUS  Nay, Socrates; the painfulness does not appear to me to follow from your
premises.


SOCRATES  Then, if, as you would argue, not more painful, the evil of the soul
is of all evils the most disgraceful; and the excess of disgrace must be caused
by some preternatural greatness, or extraordinary hurtfulness of the evil.


POLUS  Clearly.


SOCRATES  And that which exceeds most in hurtfulness will be the greatest of
evils?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  Then injustice and intemperance, and in general the depravity of the
soul, are the greatest of evils?


POLUS  That is evident.


SOCRATES  Now, what art is there which delivers us from poverty? Does not the
art of making money?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And what art frees us from disease? Does not the art of medicine?


POLUS  Very true.


SOCRATES  And what from vice and injustice? If you are not able to answer at
once, ask yourself whither we go with the sick, and to whom we take them.


POLUS  To the physicians, Socrates.


SOCRATES  And to whom do we go with the unjust and intemperate?


POLUS  To the judges, you mean.


SOCRATES  âWho are to punish them?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And do not those who rightly punish others, punish them in accordance
with a certain rule of justice?


POLUS  Clearly.


SOCRATES  Then the art of money-making frees a man from poverty; medicine from
disease; and justice from intemperance and injustice?


POLUS  That is evident.


SOCRATES  Which, then, is the best of these three?


POLUS  Will you enumerate them?


SOCRATES  Money-making, medicine, and justice.


POLUS  Justice, Socrates, far excels the two others.


SOCRATES  And justice, if the best, gives the greatest pleasure or advantage or
both?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  But is the being healed a pleasant thing, and are those who are being
healed pleased?


POLUS  I think not.


SOCRATES  A useful thing, then?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  Yes, because the patient is delivered from a great evil; and this is
the advantage of enduring the painâthat you get well?


POLUS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  And would he be the happier man in his bodily condition, who is
healed, or who never was out of health?


POLUS  Clearly he who was never out of health.


SOCRATES  Yes; for happiness surely does not consist in being delivered from
evils, but in never having had them.


POLUS  True.


SOCRATES  And suppose the case of two persons who have some evil in their
bodies, and that one of them is healed and delivered from evil, and another is
not healed, but retains the evilâwhich of them is the most miserable?


POLUS  Clearly he who is not healed.


SOCRATES  And was not punishment said by us to be a deliverance from the
greatest of evils, which is vice?


POLUS  True.


SOCRATES  And justice punishes us, and makes us more just, and is the medicine
of our vice?


POLUS  True.


SOCRATES  He, then, has the first place in the scale of happiness who has never
had vice in his soul; for this has been shown to be the greatest of evils.


POLUS  Clearly.


SOCRATES  And he has the second place, who is delivered from vice?


POLUS  True.


SOCRATES  That is to say, he who receives admonition and rebuke and punishment?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  Then he lives worst, who, having been unjust, has no deliverance from
injustice?


POLUS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  That is, he lives worst who commits the greatest crimes, and who,
being the most unjust of men, succeeds in escaping rebuke or correction or
punishment; and this, as you say, has been accomplished by Archelaus and other
tyrants and rhetoricians and potentates? (Compare Republic.)


POLUS  True.


SOCRATES  May not their way of proceeding, my friend, be compared to the
conduct of a person who is afflicted with the worst of diseases and yet
contrives not to pay the penalty to the physician for his sins against his
constitution, and will not be cured, because, like a child, he is afraid of the
pain of being burned or cut âIs not that a parallel case?


POLUS  Yes, truly.


SOCRATES  He would seem as if he did not know the nature of health and bodily
vigour; and if we are right, Polus, in our previous conclusions, they are in a
like case who strive to evade justice, which they see to be painful, but are
blind to the advantage which ensues from it, not knowing how far more miserable
a companion a diseased soul is than a diseased body; a soul, I say, which is
corrupt and unrighteous and unholy. And hence they do all that they can to
avoid punishment and to avoid being released from the greatest of evils; they
provide themselves with money and friends, and cultivate to the utmost their
powers of persuasion. But if we, Polus, are right, do you see what follows, or
shall we draw out the consequences in form?


POLUS  If you please.


SOCRATES  Is it not a fact that injustice, and the doing of injustice, is the
greatest of evils?


POLUS  That is quite clear.


SOCRATES  And further, that to suffer punishment is the way to be released from
this evil?


POLUS  True.


SOCRATES  And not to suffer, is to perpetuate the evil?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  To do wrong, then, is second only in the scale of evils; but to do
wrong and not to be punished, is first and greatest of all?


POLUS  That is true.


SOCRATES  Well, and was not this the point in dispute, my friend? You deemed
Archelaus happy, because he was a very great criminal and unpunished  I, on the
other hand, maintained that he or any other who like him has done wrong and has
not been punished, is, and ought to be, the most miserable of all men; and that
the doer of injustice is more miserable than the sufferer; and he who escapes
punishment, more miserable than he who suffers.âWas not that what I said?


POLUS  Yes.


SOCRATES  And it has been proved to be true?


POLUS  Certainly.


SOCRATES  Well, Polus, but if this is true, where is the great use of rhetoric?
If we admit what has been just now said, every man ought in every way to guard
himself against doing wrong, for he will thereby suffer great evil?


POLUS  True.


SOCRATES  And if he, or any one about whom he cares, does wrong, he ought of
his own accord to go where he will be immediately punished; he will run to the
judge, as he would to the physician, in order that the disease of injustice may
not be rendered chronic and become the incurable cancer of the soul; must we
not allow this consequence, Polus, if our former admissions are to
stand âis any other inference consistent with them?


POLUS  To that, Socrates, there can be but one answer.


SOCRATES  Then rhetoric is of no use to us, Polus, in helping a man to excuse
his own injustice, that of his parents or friends, or children or country; but
may be of use to any one who holds that instead of excusing he ought to
accuseâhimself above all, and in the next degree his family or any of his
friends who may be doing wrong; he should bring to light the iniquity and not
conceal it, that so the wrong-doer may suffer and be made whole; and he should
even force himself and others not to shrink, but with closed eyes like brave
men to let the physician operate with knife or searing iron, not regarding the
pain, in the hope of attaining the good and the honourable; let him who has
done things worthy of stripes, allow himself to be scourged, if of bonds, to be
bound, if of a fine, to be fined, if of exile, to be exiled, if of death, to
die, himself being the first to accuse himself and his own relations, and using
rhetoric to this end, that his and their unjust actions may be made manifest,
and that they themselves may be delivered from injustice, which is the greatest
evil. Then, Polus, rhetoric would indeed be useful. Do you say
âYesâ or âNoâ to that?


POLUS  To me, Socrates, what you are saying appears very strange, though
probably in agreement with your premises.


SOCRATES  Is not this the conclusion, if the premises are not disproven?


POLUS  Yes; it certainly is.


SOCRATES  And from the opposite point of view, if indeed it be our duty to harm
another, whether an enemy or notâI except the case of
self-defenceâthen I have to be upon my guardâbut if my enemy
injures a third person, then in every sort of way, by word as well as deed, I
should try to prevent his being punished, or appearing before the judge; and if
he appears, I should contrive that he should escape, and not suffer punishment 
if he has stolen a sum of money, let him keep what he has stolen and spend it
on him and his, regardless of religion and justice; and if he have done things
worthy of death, let him not die, but rather be immortal in his wickedness; or,
if this is not possible, let him at any rate be allowed to live as long as he
can. For such purposes, Polus, rhetoric may be useful, but is of small if of
any use to him who is not intending to commit injustice; at least, there was no
such use discovered by us in the previous discussion.


CALLICLES  Tell me, Chaerephon, is Socrates in earnest, or is he joking?


CHAEREPHON  I should say, Callicles, that he is in most profound earnest; but
you may well ask him.


CALLICLES  By the gods, and I will. Tell me, Socrates, are you in earnest, or
only in jest? For if you are in earnest, and what you say is true, is not the
whole of human life turned upside down; and are we not doing, as would appear,
in everything the opposite of what we ought to be doing?


SOCRATES  O Callicles, if there were not some community of feelings among
mankind, however varying in different personsâI mean to say, if every
manâs feelings were peculiar to himself and were not shared by the rest
of his speciesâI do not see how we could ever communicate our impressions
to one another. I make this remark because I perceive that you and I have a
common feeling. For we are lovers both, and both of us have two loves
apiece âI am the lover of Alcibiades, the son of Cleinias, and of
philosophy; and you of the Athenian Demus, and of Demus the son of Pyrilampes.
Now, I observe that you, with all your cleverness, do not venture to contradict
your favourite in any word or opinion of his; but as he changes you change,
backwards and forwards. When the Athenian Demus denies anything that you are
saying in the assembly, you go over to his opinion; and you do the same with
Demus, the fair young son of Pyrilampes. For you have not the power to resist
the words and ideas of your loves; and if a person were to express surprise at
the strangeness of what you say from time to time when under their influence,
you would probably reply to him, if you were honest, that you cannot help
saying what your loves say unless they are prevented; and that you can only be
silent when they are. Now you must understand that my words are an echo too,
and therefore you need not wonder at me; but if you want to silence me, silence
philosophy, who is my love, for she is always telling me what I am now telling
you, my friend; neither is she capricious like my other love, for the son of
Cleinias says one thing to-day and another thing to-morrow, but philosophy is
always true. She is the teacher at whose words you are now wondering, and you
have heard her yourself. Her you must refute, and either show, as I was saying,
that to do injustice and to escape punishment is not the worst of all evils;
or, if you leave her word unrefuted, by the dog the god of Egypt, I declare, O
Callicles, that Callicles will never be at one with himself, but that his whole
life will be a discord. And yet, my friend, I would rather that my lyre should
be inharmonious, and that there should be no music in the chorus which I
provided; aye, or that the whole world should be at odds with me, and oppose
me, rather than that I myself should be at odds with myself, and contradict
myself.


CALLICLES  O Socrates, you are a regular declaimer, and seem to be running riot
in the argument. And now you are declaiming in this way because Polus has
fallen into the same error himself of which he accused Gorgias âfor he
said that when Gorgias was asked by you, whether, if some one came to him who
wanted to learn rhetoric, and did not know justice, he would teach him justice,
Gorgias in his modesty replied that he would, because he thought that mankind
in general would be displeased if he answered âNoâ; and then in
consequence of this admission, Gorgias was compelled to contradict himself,
that being just the sort of thing in which you delight. Whereupon Polus laughed
at you deservedly, as I think; but now he has himself fallen into the same
trap. I cannot say very much for his wit when he conceded to you that to do is
more dishonourable than to suffer injustice, for this was the admission which
led to his being entangled by you; and because he was too modest to say what he
thought, he had his mouth stopped. For the truth is, Socrates, that you, who
pretend to be engaged in the pursuit of truth, are appealing now to the popular
and vulgar notions of right, which are not natural, but only conventional.
Convention and nature are generally at variance with one another  and hence, if
a person is too modest to say what he thinks, he is compelled to contradict
himself; and you, in your ingenuity perceiving the advantage to be thereby
gained, slyly ask of him who is arguing conventionally a question which is to
be determined by the rule of nature; and if he is talking of the rule of
nature, you slip away to custom  as, for instance, you did in this very
discussion about doing and suffering injustice. When Polus was speaking of the
conventionally dishonourable, you assailed him from the point of view of
nature; for by the rule of nature, to suffer injustice is the greater disgrace
because the greater evil; but conventionally, to do evil is the more
disgraceful. For the suffering of injustice is not the part of a man, but of a
slave, who indeed had better die than live; since when he is wronged and
trampled upon, he is unable to help himself, or any other about whom he cares.
The reason, as I conceive, is that the makers of laws are the majority who are
weak; and they make laws and distribute praises and censures with a view to
themselves and to their own interests; and they terrify the stronger sort of
men, and those who are able to get the better of them, in order that they may
not get the better of them; and they say, that dishonesty is shameful and
unjust; meaning, by the word injustice, the desire of a man to have more than
his neighbours; for knowing their own inferiority, I suspect that they are too
glad of equality. And therefore the endeavour to have more than the many, is
conventionally said to be shameful and unjust, and is called injustice (compare
Republic), whereas nature herself intimates that it is just for the better to
have more than the worse, the more powerful than the weaker; and in many ways
she shows, among men as well as among animals, and indeed among whole cities
and races, that justice consists in the superior ruling over and having more
than the inferior. For on what principle of justice did Xerxes invade Hellas,
or his father the Scythians? (not to speak of numberless other examples). Nay,
but these are the men who act according to nature; yes, by Heaven, and
according to the law of nature  not, perhaps, according to that artificial law,
which we invent and impose upon our fellows, of whom we take the best and
strongest from their youth upwards, and tame them like young
lions,âcharming them with the sound of the voice, and saying to them,
that with equality they must be content, and that the equal is the honourable
and the just. But if there were a man who had sufficient force, he would shake
off and break through, and escape from all this; he would trample under foot
all our formulas and spells and charms, and all our laws which are against
nature  the slave would rise in rebellion and be lord over us, and the light of
natural justice would shine forth. And this I take to be the sentiment of
Pindar, when he says in his poem, that


âLaw is the king of all, of mortals as well as of immortals;â


this, as he says,


âMakes might to be right, doing violence with highest hand; as I infer
from the deeds of Heracles, for without buying themââ (Fragm.
Incert. 151 (Bockh).) âI do not remember the exact words, but the meaning
is, that without buying them, and without their being given to him, he carried
off the oxen of Geryon, according to the law of natural right, and that the
oxen and other possessions of the weaker and inferior properly belong to the
stronger and superior. And this is true, as you may ascertain, if you will
leave philosophy and go on to higher things  for philosophy, Socrates, if
pursued in moderation and at the proper age, is an elegant accomplishment, but
too much philosophy is the ruin of human life. Even if a man has good parts,
still, if he carries philosophy into later life, he is necessarily ignorant of
all those things which a gentleman and a person of honour ought to know; he is
inexperienced in the laws of the State, and in the language which ought to be
used in the dealings of man with man, whether private or public, and utterly
ignorant of the pleasures and desires of mankind and of human character in
general. And people of this sort, when they betake themselves to politics or
business, are as ridiculous as I imagine the politicians to be, when they make
their appearance in the arena of philosophy. For, as Euripides says,


âEvery man shines in that and pursues that, and devotes the greatest
portion of the day to that in which he most excels,â (Antiope, fragm. 20
(Dindorf).)


but anything in which he is inferior, he avoids and depreciates, and praises
the opposite from partiality to himself, and because he thinks that he will
thus praise himself. The true principle is to unite them. Philosophy, as a part
of education, is an excellent thing, and there is no disgrace to a man while he
is young in pursuing such a study; but when he is more advanced in years, the
thing becomes ridiculous, and I feel towards philosophers as I do towards those
who lisp and imitate children. For I love to see a little child, who is not of
an age to speak plainly, lisping at his play; there is an appearance of grace
and freedom in his utterance, which is natural to his childish years. But when
I hear some small creature carefully articulating its words, I am offended; the
sound is disagreeable, and has to my ears the twang of slavery. So when I hear
a man lisping, or see him playing like a child, his behaviour appears to me
ridiculous and unmanly and worthy of stripes. And I have the same feeling about
students of philosophy; when I see a youth thus engaged,âthe study
appears to me to be in character, and becoming a man of liberal education, and
him who neglects philosophy I regard as an inferior man, who will never aspire
to anything great or noble. But if I see him continuing the study in later
life, and not leaving off, I should like to beat him, Socrates; for, as I was
saying, such a one, even though he have good natural parts, becomes effeminate.
He flies from the busy centre and the market-place, in which, as the poet says,
men become distinguished; he creeps into a corner for the rest of his life, and
talks in a whisper with three or four admiring youths, but never speaks out
like a freeman in a satisfactory manner. Now I, Socrates, am very well inclined
towards you, and my feeling may be compared with that of Zethus towards
Amphion, in the play of Euripides, whom I was mentioning just now  for I am
disposed to say to you much what Zethus said to his brother, that you,
Socrates, are careless about the things of which you ought to be careful; and
that you


âWho have a soul so noble, are remarkable for a puerile exterior; Neither
in a court of justice could you state a case, or give any reason or proof, Or
offer valiant counsel on anotherâs behalf.â


And you must not be offended, my dear Socrates, for I am speaking out of
good-will towards you, if I ask whether you are not ashamed of being thus
defenceless; which I affirm to be the condition not of you only but of all
those who will carry the study of philosophy too far. For suppose that some one
were to take you, or any one of your sort, off to prison, declaring that you
had done wrong when you had done no wrong, you must allow that you would not
know what to do âthere you would stand giddy and gaping, and not having a
word to say; and when you went up before the Court, even if the accuser were a
poor creature and not good for much, you would die if he were disposed to claim
the penalty of death. And yet, Socrates, what is the value of


âAn art which converts a man of sense into a fool,â


who is helpless, and has no power to save either himself or others, when he is
in the greatest danger and is going to be despoiled by his enemies of all his
goods, and has to live, simply deprived of his rights of citizenship?âhe
being a man who, if I may use the expression, may be boxed on the ears with
impunity. Then, my good friend, take my advice, and refute no more 


âLearn the philosophy of business, and acquire the reputation of wisdom.
But leave to others these niceties,â


whether they are to be described as follies or absurdities 


âFor they will only Give you poverty for the inmate of your
dwelling.â


Cease, then, emulating these paltry splitters of words, and emulate only the
man of substance and honour, who is well to do.


SOCRATES  If my soul, Callicles, were made of gold, should I not rejoice to
discover one of those stones with which they test gold, and the very best
possible one to which I might bring my soul; and if the stone and I agreed in
approving of her training, then I should know that I was in a satisfactory
state, and that no other test was needed by me.


CALLICLES  What is your meaning, Socrates?


SOCRATES  I will tell you; I think that I have found in you the desired
touchstone.


CALLICLES  Why?


SOCRATES  Because I am sure that if you agree with me in any of the opinions
which my soul forms, I have at last found the truth indeed. For I consider that
if a man is to make a complete trial of the good or evil of the soul, he ought
to have three qualitiesâknowledge, good-will, outspokenness, which are
all possessed by you. Many whom I meet are unable to make trial of me, because
they are not wise as you are; others are wise, but they will not tell me the
truth, because they have not the same interest in me which you have; and these
two strangers, Gorgias and Polus, are undoubtedly wise men and my very good
friends, but they are not outspoken enough, and they are too modest. Why, their
modesty is so great that they are driven to contradict themselves, first one
and then the other of them, in the face of a large company, on matters of the
highest moment. But you have all the qualities in which these others are
deficient, having received an excellent education; to this many Athenians can
testify. And you are my friend. Shall I tell you why I think so? I know that
you, Callicles, and Tisander of Aphidnae, and Andron the son of Androtion, and
Nausicydes of the deme of Cholarges, studied together  there were four of you,
and I once heard you advising with one another as to the extent to which the
pursuit of philosophy should be carried, and, as I know, you came to the
conclusion that the study should not be pushed too much into detail. You were
cautioning one another not to be overwise; you were afraid that too much wisdom
might unconsciously to yourselves be the ruin of you. And now when I hear you
giving the same advice to me which you then gave to your most intimate friends,
I have a sufficient evidence of your real good-will to me. And of the frankness
of your nature and freedom from modesty I am assured by yourself, and the
assurance is confirmed by your last speech. Well then, the inference in the
present case clearly is, that if you agree with me in an argument about any
point, that point will have been sufficiently tested by us, and will not
require to be submitted to any further test. For you could not have agreed with
me, either from lack of knowledge or from superfluity of modesty, nor yet from
a desire to deceive me, for you are my friend, as you tell me yourself. And
therefore when you and I are agreed, the result will be the attainment of
perfect truth. Now there is no nobler enquiry, Callicles, than that which you
censure me for making,âWhat ought the character of a man to be, and what
his pursuits, and how far is he to go, both in maturer years and in youth? For
be assured that if I err in my own conduct I do not err intentionally, but from
ignorance. Do not then desist from advising me, now that you have begun, until
I have learned clearly what this is which I am to practise, and how I may
acquire it. And if you find me assenting to your words, and hereafter not doing
that to which I assented, call me âdolt,â and deem me unworthy of
receiving further instruction. Once more, then, tell me what you and Pindar
mean by natural justice  Do you not mean that the superior should take the
property of the inferior by force; that the better should rule the worse, the
noble have more than the mean? Am I not right in my recollection?


CALLICLES  Yes; that is what I was saying, and so I still aver.


SOCRATES  And do you mean by the better the same as the superior? for I could
not make out what you were saying at the timeâwhether you meant by the
superior the stronger, and that the weaker must obey the stronger, as you
seemed to imply when you said that great cities attack small ones in accordance
with natural right, because they are superior and stronger, as though the
superior and stronger and better were the same; or whether the better may be
also the inferior and weaker, and the superior the worse, or whether better is
to be defined in the same way as superior âthis is the point which I want
to have cleared up. Are the superior and better and stronger the same or
different?


CALLICLES  I say unequivocally that they are the same.


SOCRATES  Then the many are by nature superior to the one, against whom, as you
were saying, they make the laws?


CALLICLES  Certainly.


SOCRATES  Then the laws of the many are the laws of the superior?


CALLICLES  Very true.


SOCRATES  Then they are the laws of the better; for the superior class are far
better, as you were saying?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And since they are superior, the laws which are made by them are by
nature good?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And are not the many of opinion, as you were lately saying, that
justice is equality, and that to do is more disgraceful than to suffer
injustice?âis that so or not? Answer, Callicles, and let no modesty be
found to come in the way; do the many think, or do they not think thus?âI
must beg of you to answer, in order that if you agree with me I may fortify
myself by the assent of so competent an authority.


CALLICLES  Yes; the opinion of the many is what you say.


SOCRATES  Then not only custom but nature also affirms that to do is more
disgraceful than to suffer injustice, and that justice is equality; so that you
seem to have been wrong in your former assertion, when accusing me you said
that nature and custom are opposed, and that I, knowing this, was dishonestly
playing between them, appealing to custom when the argument is about nature,
and to nature when the argument is about custom?


CALLICLES  This man will never cease talking nonsense. At your age, Socrates,
are you not ashamed to be catching at words and chuckling over some verbal
slip? do you not seeâhave I not told you already, that by superior I mean
better  do you imagine me to say, that if a rabble of slaves and nondescripts,
who are of no use except perhaps for their physical strength, get together,
their ipsissima verba are laws?


SOCRATES  Ho! my philosopher, is that your line?


CALLICLES  Certainly.


SOCRATES  I was thinking, Callicles, that something of the kind must have been
in your mind, and that is why I repeated the question,âWhat is the
superior? I wanted to know clearly what you meant; for you surely do not think
that two men are better than one, or that your slaves are better than you
because they are stronger? Then please to begin again, and tell me who the
better are, if they are not the stronger; and I will ask you, great Sir, to be
a little milder in your instructions, or I shall have to run away from you.


CALLICLES  You are ironical.


SOCRATES  No, by the hero Zethus, Callicles, by whose aid you were just now
saying many ironical things against me, I am not âtell me, then, whom you
mean, by the better?


CALLICLES  I mean the more excellent.


SOCRATES  Do you not see that you are yourself using words which have no
meaning and that you are explaining nothing?âwill you tell me whether you
mean by the better and superior the wiser, or if not, whom?


CALLICLES  Most assuredly, I do mean the wiser.


SOCRATES  Then according to you, one wise man may often be superior to ten
thousand fools, and he ought to rule them, and they ought to be his subjects,
and he ought to have more than they should. This is what I believe that you
mean (and you must not suppose that I am word-catching), if you allow that the
one is superior to the ten thousand?


CALLICLES  Yes; that is what I mean, and that is what I conceive to be natural
justiceâthat the better and wiser should rule and have more than the
inferior.


SOCRATES  Stop there, and let me ask you what you would say in this case  Let
us suppose that we are all together as we are now; there are several of us, and
we have a large common store of meats and drinks, and there are all sorts of
persons in our company having various degrees of strength and weakness, and one
of us, being a physician, is wiser in the matter of food than all the rest, and
he is probably stronger than some and not so strong as others of usâwill
he not, being wiser, be also better than we are, and our superior in this
matter of food?


CALLICLES  Certainly.


SOCRATES  Either, then, he will have a larger share of the meats and drinks,
because he is better, or he will have the distribution of all of them by reason
of his authority, but he will not expend or make use of a larger share of them
on his own person, or if he does, he will be punished;âhis share will
exceed that of some, and be less than that of others, and if he be the weakest
of all, he being the best of all will have the smallest share of all,
Callicles âam I not right, my friend?


CALLICLES  You talk about meats and drinks and physicians and other nonsense; I
am not speaking of them.


SOCRATES  Well, but do you admit that the wiser is the better? Answer
âYesâ or âNo.â


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And ought not the better to have a larger share?


CALLICLES  Not of meats and drinks.


SOCRATES  I understand  then, perhaps, of coatsâthe skilfullest weaver
ought to have the largest coat, and the greatest number of them, and go about
clothed in the best and finest of them?


CALLICLES  Fudge about coats!


SOCRATES  Then the skilfullest and best in making shoes ought to have the
advantage in shoes; the shoemaker, clearly, should walk about in the largest
shoes, and have the greatest number of them?


CALLICLES  Fudge about shoes! What nonsense are you talking?


SOCRATES  Or, if this is not your meaning, perhaps you would say that the wise
and good and true husbandman should actually have a larger share of seeds, and
have as much seed as possible for his own land?


CALLICLES  How you go on, always talking in the same way, Socrates!


SOCRATES  Yes, Callicles, and also about the same things.


CALLICLES  Yes, by the Gods, you are literally always talking of cobblers and
fullers and cooks and doctors, as if this had to do with our argument.


SOCRATES  But why will you not tell me in what a man must be superior and wiser
in order to claim a larger share; will you neither accept a suggestion, nor
offer one?


CALLICLES  I have already told you. In the first place, I mean by superiors not
cobblers or cooks, but wise politicians who understand the administration of a
state, and who are not only wise, but also valiant and able to carry out their
designs, and not the men to faint from want of soul.


SOCRATES  See now, most excellent Callicles, how different my charge against
you is from that which you bring against me, for you reproach me with always
saying the same; but I reproach you with never saying the same about the same
things, for at one time you were defining the better and the superior to be the
stronger, then again as the wiser, and now you bring forward a new notion; the
superior and the better are now declared by you to be the more courageous  I
wish, my good friend, that you would tell me, once for all, whom you affirm to
be the better and superior, and in what they are better?


CALLICLES  I have already told you that I mean those who are wise and
courageous in the administration of a stateâthey ought to be the rulers
of their states, and justice consists in their having more than their subjects.


SOCRATES  But whether rulers or subjects will they or will they not have more
than themselves, my friend?


CALLICLES  What do you mean?


SOCRATES  I mean that every man is his own ruler; but perhaps you think that
there is no necessity for him to rule himself; he is only required to rule
others?


CALLICLES  What do you mean by his âruling over himselfâ?


SOCRATES  A simple thing enough; just what is commonly said, that a man should
be temperate and master of himself, and ruler of his own pleasures and
passions.


CALLICLES  What innocence! you mean those fools,âthe temperate?


SOCRATES  Certainly âany one may know that to be my meaning.


CALLICLES  Quite so, Socrates; and they are really fools, for how can a man be
happy who is the servant of anything? On the contrary, I plainly assert, that
he who would truly live ought to allow his desires to wax to the uttermost, and
not to chastise them; but when they have grown to their greatest he should have
courage and intelligence to minister to them and to satisfy all his longings.
And this I affirm to be natural justice and nobility. To this however the many
cannot attain; and they blame the strong man because they are ashamed of their
own weakness, which they desire to conceal, and hence they say that
intemperance is base. As I have remarked already, they enslave the nobler
natures, and being unable to satisfy their pleasures, they praise temperance
and justice out of their own cowardice. For if a man had been originally the
son of a king, or had a nature capable of acquiring an empire or a tyranny or
sovereignty, what could be more truly base or evil than temperanceâto a
man like him, I say, who might freely be enjoying every good, and has no one to
stand in his way, and yet has admitted custom and reason and the opinion of
other men to be lords over him?âmust not he be in a miserable plight whom
the reputation of justice and temperance hinders from giving more to his
friends than to his enemies, even though he be a ruler in his city? Nay,
Socrates, for you profess to be a votary of the truth, and the truth is
this âthat luxury and intemperance and licence, if they be provided with
means, are virtue and happinessâall the rest is a mere bauble, agreements
contrary to nature, foolish talk of men, nothing worth. (Compare Republic.)


SOCRATES  There is a noble freedom, Callicles, in your way of approaching the
argument; for what you say is what the rest of the world think, but do not like
to say. And I must beg of you to persevere, that the true rule of human life
may become manifest. Tell me, then âyou say, do you not, that in the
rightly-developed man the passions ought not to be controlled, but that we
should let them grow to the utmost and somehow or other satisfy them, and that
this is virtue?


CALLICLES  Yes; I do.


SOCRATES  Then those who want nothing are not truly said to be happy?


CALLICLES  No indeed, for then stones and dead men would be the happiest of
all.


SOCRATES  But surely life according to your view is an awful thing; and indeed
I think that Euripides may have been right in saying,


âWho knows if life be not death and death life;â


and that we are very likely dead; I have heard a philosopher say that at this
moment we are actually dead, and that the body (soma) is our tomb (sema
(compare Phaedr.)), and that the part of the soul which is the seat of the
desires is liable to be tossed about by words and blown up and down; and some
ingenious person, probably a Sicilian or an Italian, playing with the word,
invented a tale in which he called the soulâbecause of its believing and
make-believe natureâa vessel (An untranslatable pun,âdia to
pithanon te kai pistikon onomase pithon.), and the ignorant he called the
uninitiated or leaky, and the place in the souls of the uninitiated in which
the desires are seated, being the intemperate and incontinent part, he compared
to a vessel full of holes, because it can never be satisfied. He is not of your
way of thinking, Callicles, for he declares, that of all the souls in Hades,
meaning the invisible world (aeides), these uninitiated or leaky persons are
the most miserable, and that they pour water into a vessel which is full of
holes out of a colander which is similarly perforated. The colander, as my
informer assures me, is the soul, and the soul which he compares to a colander
is the soul of the ignorant, which is likewise full of holes, and therefore
incontinent, owing to a bad memory and want of faith. These notions are strange
enough, but they show the principle which, if I can, I would fain prove to you;
that you should change your mind, and, instead of the intemperate and insatiate
life, choose that which is orderly and sufficient and has a due provision for
daily needs. Do I make any impression on you, and are you coming over to the
opinion that the orderly are happier than the intemperate? Or do I fail to
persuade you, and, however many tales I rehearse to you, do you continue of the
same opinion still?


CALLICLES  The latter, Socrates, is more like the truth.


SOCRATES  Well, I will tell you another image, which comes out of the same
school âLet me request you to consider how far you would accept this as
an account of the two lives of the temperate and intemperate in a
figure âThere are two men, both of whom have a number of casks; the one
man has his casks sound and full, one of wine, another of honey, and a third of
milk, besides others filled with other liquids, and the streams which fill them
are few and scanty, and he can only obtain them with a great deal of toil and
difficulty; but when his casks are once filled he has no need to feed them any
more, and has no further trouble with them or care about them. The other, in
like manner, can procure streams, though not without difficulty; but his
vessels are leaky and unsound, and night and day he is compelled to be filling
them, and if he pauses for a moment, he is in an agony of pain. Such are their
respective lives âAnd now would you say that the life of the intemperate
is happier than that of the temperate? Do I not convince you that the opposite
is the truth?


CALLICLES  You do not convince me, Socrates, for the one who has filled himself
has no longer any pleasure left; and this, as I was just now saying, is the
life of a stone  he has neither joy nor sorrow after he is once filled; but the
pleasure depends on the superabundance of the influx.


SOCRATES  But the more you pour in, the greater the waste; and the holes must
be large for the liquid to escape.


CALLICLES  Certainly.


SOCRATES  The life which you are now depicting is not that of a dead man, or of
a stone, but of a cormorant; you mean that he is to be hungering and eating?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And he is to be thirsting and drinking?


CALLICLES  Yes, that is what I mean; he is to have all his desires about him,
and to be able to live happily in the gratification of them.


SOCRATES  Capital, excellent; go on as you have begun, and have no shame; I,
too, must disencumber myself of shame  and first, will you tell me whether you
include itching and scratching, provided you have enough of them and pass your
life in scratching, in your notion of happiness?


CALLICLES  What a strange being you are, Socrates! a regular mob-orator.


SOCRATES  That was the reason, Callicles, why I scared Polus and Gorgias, until
they were too modest to say what they thought; but you will not be too modest
and will not be scared, for you are a brave man. And now, answer my question.


CALLICLES  I answer, that even the scratcher would live pleasantly.


SOCRATES  And if pleasantly, then also happily?


CALLICLES  To be sure.


SOCRATES  But what if the itching is not confined to the head? Shall I pursue
the question? And here, Callicles, I would have you consider how you would
reply if consequences are pressed upon you, especially if in the last resort
you are asked, whether the life of a catamite is not terrible, foul, miserable?
Or would you venture to say, that they too are happy, if they only get enough
of what they want?


CALLICLES  Are you not ashamed, Socrates, of introducing such topics into the
argument?


SOCRATES  Well, my fine friend, but am I the introducer of these topics, or he
who says without any qualification that all who feel pleasure in whatever
manner are happy, and who admits of no distinction between good and bad
pleasures? And I would still ask, whether you say that pleasure and good are
the same, or whether there is some pleasure which is not a good?


CALLICLES  Well, then, for the sake of consistency, I will say that they are
the same.


SOCRATES  You are breaking the original agreement, Callicles, and will no
longer be a satisfactory companion in the search after truth, if you say what
is contrary to your real opinion.


CALLICLES  Why, that is what you are doing too, Socrates.


SOCRATES  Then we are both doing wrong. Still, my dear friend, I would ask you
to consider whether pleasure, from whatever source derived, is the good; for,
if this be true, then the disagreeable consequences which have been darkly
intimated must follow, and many others.


CALLICLES  That, Socrates, is only your opinion.


SOCRATES  And do you, Callicles, seriously maintain what you are saying?


CALLICLES  Indeed I do.


SOCRATES  Then, as you are in earnest, shall we proceed with the argument?


CALLICLES  By all means. (Or, âI am in profound earnest.â)


SOCRATES  Well, if you are willing to proceed, determine this question for
me âThere is something, I presume, which you would call knowledge?


CALLICLES  There is.


SOCRATES  And were you not saying just now, that some courage implied
knowledge?


CALLICLES  I was.


SOCRATES  And you were speaking of courage and knowledge as two things
different from one another?


CALLICLES  Certainly I was.


SOCRATES  And would you say that pleasure and knowledge are the same, or not
the same?


CALLICLES  Not the same, O man of wisdom.


SOCRATES  And would you say that courage differed from pleasure?


CALLICLES  Certainly.


SOCRATES  Well, then, let us remember that Callicles, the Acharnian, says that
pleasure and good are the same; but that knowledge and courage are not the
same, either with one another, or with the good.


CALLICLES  And what does our friend Socrates, of Foxton, sayâdoes he
assent to this, or not?


SOCRATES  He does not assent; neither will Callicles, when he sees himself
truly. You will admit, I suppose, that good and evil fortune are opposed to
each other?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And if they are opposed to each other, then, like health and disease,
they exclude one another; a man cannot have them both, or be without them both,
at the same time?


CALLICLES  What do you mean?


SOCRATES  Take the case of any bodily affection âa man may have the
complaint in his eyes which is called ophthalmia?


CALLICLES  To be sure.


SOCRATES  But he surely cannot have the same eyes well and sound at the same
time?


CALLICLES  Certainly not.


SOCRATES  And when he has got rid of his ophthalmia, has he got rid of the
health of his eyes too? Is the final result, that he gets rid of them both
together?


CALLICLES  Certainly not.


SOCRATES  That would surely be marvellous and absurd?


CALLICLES  Very.


SOCRATES  I suppose that he is affected by them, and gets rid of them in turns?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And he may have strength and weakness in the same way, by fits?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  Or swiftness and slowness?


CALLICLES  Certainly.


SOCRATES  And does he have and not have good and happiness, and their
opposites, evil and misery, in a similar alternation? (Compare Republic.)


CALLICLES  Certainly he has.


SOCRATES  If then there be anything which a man has and has not at the same
time, clearly that cannot be good and evilâdo we agree? Please not to
answer without consideration.


CALLICLES  I entirely agree.


SOCRATES  Go back now to our former admissions.âDid you say that to
hunger, I mean the mere state of hunger, was pleasant or painful?


CALLICLES  I said painful, but that to eat when you are hungry is pleasant.


SOCRATES  I know; but still the actual hunger is painful  am I not right?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And thirst, too, is painful?


CALLICLES  Yes, very.


SOCRATES  Need I adduce any more instances, or would you agree that all wants
or desires are painful?


CALLICLES  I agree, and therefore you need not adduce any more instances.


SOCRATES  Very good. And you would admit that to drink, when you are thirsty,
is pleasant?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And in the sentence which you have just uttered, the word
âthirstyâ implies pain?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And the word âdrinkingâ is expressive of pleasure, and of
the satisfaction of the want?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  There is pleasure in drinking?


CALLICLES  Certainly.


SOCRATES  When you are thirsty?


SOCRATES  And in pain?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  Do you see the inference âthat pleasure and pain are
simultaneous, when you say that being thirsty, you drink? For are they not
simultaneous, and do they not affect at the same time the same part, whether of
the soul or the body?âwhich of them is affected cannot be supposed to be
of any consequence  Is not this true?


CALLICLES  It is.


SOCRATES  You said also, that no man could have good and evil fortune at the
same time?


CALLICLES  Yes, I did.


SOCRATES  But you admitted, that when in pain a man might also have pleasure?


CALLICLES  Clearly.


SOCRATES  Then pleasure is not the same as good fortune, or pain the same as
evil fortune, and therefore the good is not the same as the pleasant?


CALLICLES  I wish I knew, Socrates, what your quibbling means.


SOCRATES  You know, Callicles, but you affect not to know.


CALLICLES  Well, get on, and donât keep fooling  then you will know what
a wiseacre you are in your admonition of me.


SOCRATES  Does not a man cease from his thirst and from his pleasure in
drinking at the same time?


CALLICLES  I do not understand what you are saying.


GORGIAS  Nay, Callicles, answer, if only for our sakes;âwe should like to
hear the argument out.


CALLICLES  Yes, Gorgias, but I must complain of the habitual trifling of
Socrates; he is always arguing about little and unworthy questions.


GORGIAS  What matter? Your reputation, Callicles, is not at stake. Let Socrates
argue in his own fashion.


CALLICLES  Well, then, Socrates, you shall ask these little peddling questions,
since Gorgias wishes to have them.


SOCRATES  I envy you, Callicles, for having been initiated into the great
mysteries before you were initiated into the lesser. I thought that this was
not allowable. But to return to our argument âDoes not a man cease from
thirsting and from the pleasure of drinking at the same moment?


CALLICLES  True.


SOCRATES  And if he is hungry, or has any other desire, does he not cease from
the desire and the pleasure at the same moment?


CALLICLES  Very true.


SOCRATES  Then he ceases from pain and pleasure at the same moment?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  But he does not cease from good and evil at the same moment, as you
have admitted  do you still adhere to what you said?


CALLICLES  Yes, I do; but what is the inference?


SOCRATES  Why, my friend, the inference is that the good is not the same as the
pleasant, or the evil the same as the painful; there is a cessation of pleasure
and pain at the same moment; but not of good and evil, for they are different.
How then can pleasure be the same as good, or pain as evil? And I would have
you look at the matter in another light, which could hardly, I think, have been
considered by you when you identified them  Are not the good good because they
have good present with them, as the beautiful are those who have beauty present
with them?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And do you call the fools and cowards good men? For you were saying
just now that the courageous and the wise are the goodâwould you not say
so?


CALLICLES  Certainly.


SOCRATES  And did you never see a foolish child rejoicing?


CALLICLES  Yes, I have.


SOCRATES  And a foolish man too?


CALLICLES  Yes, certainly; but what is your drift?


SOCRATES  Nothing particular, if you will only answer.


CALLICLES  Yes, I have.


SOCRATES  And did you ever see a sensible man rejoicing or sorrowing?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  Which rejoice and sorrow mostâthe wise or the foolish?


CALLICLES  They are much upon a par, I think, in that respect.


SOCRATES  Enough  And did you ever see a coward in battle?


CALLICLES  To be sure.


SOCRATES  And which rejoiced most at the departure of the enemy, the coward or
the brave?


CALLICLES  I should say âmostâ of both; or at any rate, they
rejoiced about equally.


SOCRATES  No matter; then the cowards, and not only the brave, rejoice?


CALLICLES  Greatly.


SOCRATES  And the foolish; so it would seem?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And are only the cowards pained at the approach of their enemies, or
are the brave also pained?


CALLICLES  Both are pained.


SOCRATES  And are they equally pained?


CALLICLES  I should imagine that the cowards are more pained.


SOCRATES  And are they not better pleased at the enemyâs departure?


CALLICLES  I dare say.


SOCRATES  Then are the foolish and the wise and the cowards and the brave all
pleased and pained, as you were saying, in nearly equal degree; but are the
cowards more pleased and pained than the brave?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  But surely the wise and brave are the good, and the foolish and the
cowardly are the bad?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  Then the good and the bad are pleased and pained in a nearly equal
degree?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  Then are the good and bad good and bad in a nearly equal degree, or
have the bad the advantage both in good and evil? (i.e. in having more pleasure
and more pain.)


CALLICLES  I really do not know what you mean.


SOCRATES  Why, do you not remember saying that the good were good because good
was present with them, and the evil because evil; and that pleasures were goods
and pains evils?


CALLICLES  Yes, I remember.


SOCRATES  And are not these pleasures or goods present to those who
rejoiceâif they do rejoice?


CALLICLES  Certainly.


SOCRATES  Then those who rejoice are good when goods are present with them?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And those who are in pain have evil or sorrow present with them?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And would you still say that the evil are evil by reason of the
presence of evil?


CALLICLES  I should.


SOCRATES  Then those who rejoice are good, and those who are in pain evil?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  The degrees of good and evil vary with the degrees of pleasure and of
pain?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  Have the wise man and the fool, the brave and the coward, joy and
pain in nearly equal degrees? or would you say that the coward has more?


CALLICLES  I should say that he has.


SOCRATES  Help me then to draw out the conclusion which follows from our
admissions; for it is good to repeat and review what is good twice and thrice
over, as they say. Both the wise man and the brave man we allow to be good?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And the foolish man and the coward to be evil?


CALLICLES  Certainly.


SOCRATES  And he who has joy is good?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And he who is in pain is evil?


CALLICLES  Certainly.


SOCRATES  The good and evil both have joy and pain, but, perhaps, the evil has
more of them?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  Then must we not infer, that the bad man is as good and bad as the
good, or, perhaps, even better?âis not this a further inference which
follows equally with the preceding from the assertion that the good and the
pleasant are the same âcan this be denied, Callicles?


CALLICLES  I have been listening and making admissions to you, Socrates; and I
remark that if a person grants you anything in play, you, like a child, want to
keep hold and will not give it back. But do you really suppose that I or any
other human being denies that some pleasures are good and others bad?


SOCRATES  Alas, Callicles, how unfair you are! you certainly treat me as if I
were a child, sometimes saying one thing, and then another, as if you were
meaning to deceive me. And yet I thought at first that you were my friend, and
would not have deceived me if you could have helped. But I see that I was
mistaken; and now I suppose that I must make the best of a bad business, as
they said of old, and take what I can get out of you.âWell, then, as I
understand you to say, I may assume that some pleasures are good and others
evil?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  The beneficial are good, and the hurtful are evil?


CALLICLES  To be sure.


SOCRATES  And the beneficial are those which do some good, and the hurtful are
those which do some evil?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  Take, for example, the bodily pleasures of eating and drinking, which
we were just now mentioningâyou mean to say that those which promote
health, or any other bodily excellence, are good, and their opposites evil?


CALLICLES  Certainly.


SOCRATES  And in the same way there are good pains and there are evil pains?


CALLICLES  To be sure.


SOCRATES  And ought we not to choose and use the good pleasures and pains?


CALLICLES  Certainly.


SOCRATES  But not the evil?


CALLICLES  Clearly.


SOCRATES  Because, if you remember, Polus and I have agreed that all our
actions are to be done for the sake of the good;âand will you agree with
us in saying, that the good is the end of all our actions, and that all our
actions are to be done for the sake of the good, and not the good for the sake
of them?âwill you add a third vote to our two?


CALLICLES  I will.


SOCRATES  Then pleasure, like everything else, is to be sought for the sake of
that which is good, and not that which is good for the sake of pleasure?


CALLICLES  To be sure.


SOCRATES  But can every man choose what pleasures are good and what are evil,
or must he have art or knowledge of them in detail?


CALLICLES  He must have art.


SOCRATES  Let me now remind you of what I was saying to Gorgias and Polus; I
was saying, as you will not have forgotten, that there were some processes
which aim only at pleasure, and know nothing of a better and worse, and there
are other processes which know good and evil. And I considered that cookery,
which I do not call an art, but only an experience, was of the former class,
which is concerned with pleasure, and that the art of medicine was of the class
which is concerned with the good. And now, by the god of friendship, I must beg
you, Callicles, not to jest, or to imagine that I am jesting with you; do not
answer at random and contrary to your real opinionâfor you will observe
that we are arguing about the way of human life; and to a man who has any sense
at all, what question can be more serious than this?âwhether he should
follow after that way of life to which you exhort me, and act what you call the
manly part of speaking in the assembly, and cultivating rhetoric, and engaging
in public affairs, according to the principles now in vogue; or whether he
should pursue the life of philosophy;âand in what the latter way differs
from the former. But perhaps we had better first try to distinguish them, as I
did before, and when we have come to an agreement that they are distinct, we
may proceed to consider in what they differ from one another, and which of them
we should choose. Perhaps, however, you do not even now understand what I mean?


CALLICLES  No, I do not.


SOCRATES  Then I will explain myself more clearly  seeing that you and I have
agreed that there is such a thing as good, and that there is such a thing as
pleasure, and that pleasure is not the same as good, and that the pursuit and
process of acquisition of the one, that is pleasure, is different from the
pursuit and process of acquisition of the other, which is goodâI wish
that you would tell me whether you agree with me thus far or notâdo you
agree?


CALLICLES  I do.


SOCRATES  Then I will proceed, and ask whether you also agree with me, and
whether you think that I spoke the truth when I further said to Gorgias and
Polus that cookery in my opinion is only an experience, and not an art at all;
and that whereas medicine is an art, and attends to the nature and constitution
of the patient, and has principles of action and reason in each case, cookery
in attending upon pleasure never regards either the nature or reason of that
pleasure to which she devotes herself, but goes straight to her end, nor ever
considers or calculates anything, but works by experience and routine, and just
preserves the recollection of what she has usually done when producing
pleasure. And first, I would have you consider whether I have proved what I was
saying, and then whether there are not other similar processes which have to do
with the soulâsome of them processes of art, making a provision for the
soulâs highest interestâothers despising the interest, and, as in
the previous case, considering only the pleasure of the soul, and how this may
be acquired, but not considering what pleasures are good or bad, and having no
other aim but to afford gratification, whether good or bad. In my opinion,
Callicles, there are such processes, and this is the sort of thing which I term
flattery, whether concerned with the body or the soul, or whenever employed
with a view to pleasure and without any consideration of good and evil. And now
I wish that you would tell me whether you agree with us in this notion, or
whether you differ.


CALLICLES  I do not differ; on the contrary, I agree; for in that way I shall
soonest bring the argument to an end, and shall oblige my friend Gorgias.


SOCRATES  And is this notion true of one soul, or of two or more?


CALLICLES  Equally true of two or more.


SOCRATES  Then a man may delight a whole assembly, and yet have no regard for
their true interests?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  Can you tell me the pursuits which delight mankindâor rather,
if you would prefer, let me ask, and do you answer, which of them belong to the
pleasurable class, and which of them not? In the first place, what say you of
flute-playing? Does not that appear to be an art which seeks only pleasure,
Callicles, and thinks of nothing else?


CALLICLES  I assent.


SOCRATES  And is not the same true of all similar arts, as, for example, the
art of playing the lyre at festivals?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And what do you say of the choral art and of dithyrambic
poetry?âare not they of the same nature? Do you imagine that Cinesias the
son of Meles cares about what will tend to the moral improvement of his
hearers, or about what will give pleasure to the multitude?


CALLICLES  There can be no mistake about Cinesias, Socrates.


SOCRATES  And what do you say of his father, Meles the harp-player? Did he
perform with any view to the good of his hearers? Could he be said to regard
even their pleasure? For his singing was an infliction to his audience. And of
harp-playing and dithyrambic poetry in general, what would you say? Have they
not been invented wholly for the sake of pleasure?


CALLICLES  That is my notion of them.


SOCRATES  And as for the Muse of Tragedy, that solemn and august
personageâwhat are her aspirations? Is all her aim and desire only to
give pleasure to the spectators, or does she fight against them and refuse to
speak of their pleasant vices, and willingly proclaim in word and song truths
welcome and unwelcome?âwhich in your judgment is her character?


CALLICLES  There can be no doubt, Socrates, that Tragedy has her face turned
towards pleasure and the gratification of the audience.


SOCRATES  And is not that the sort of thing, Callicles, which we were just now
describing as flattery?


CALLICLES  Quite true.


SOCRATES  Well now, suppose that we strip all poetry of song and rhythm and
metre, there will remain speech? (Compare Republic.)


CALLICLES  To be sure.


SOCRATES  And this speech is addressed to a crowd of people?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  Then poetry is a sort of rhetoric?


CALLICLES  True.


SOCRATES  And do not the poets in the theatres seem to you to be rhetoricians?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  Then now we have discovered a sort of rhetoric which is addressed to
a crowd of men, women, and children, freemen and slaves. And this is not much
to our taste, for we have described it as having the nature of flattery.


CALLICLES  Quite true.


SOCRATES  Very good. And what do you say of that other rhetoric which addresses
the Athenian assembly and the assemblies of freemen in other states? Do the
rhetoricians appear to you always to aim at what is best, and do they seek to
improve the citizens by their speeches, or are they too, like the rest of
mankind, bent upon giving them pleasure, forgetting the public good in the
thought of their own interest, playing with the people as with children, and
trying to amuse them, but never considering whether they are better or worse
for this?


CALLICLES  I must distinguish. There are some who have a real care of the
public in what they say, while others are such as you describe.


SOCRATES  I am contented with the admission that rhetoric is of two sorts; one,
which is mere flattery and disgraceful declamation; the other, which is noble
and aims at the training and improvement of the souls of the citizens, and
strives to say what is best, whether welcome or unwelcome, to the audience; but
have you ever known such a rhetoric; or if you have, and can point out any
rhetorician who is of this stamp, who is he?


CALLICLES  But, indeed, I am afraid that I cannot tell you of any such among
the orators who are at present living.


SOCRATES  Well, then, can you mention any one of a former generation, who may
be said to have improved the Athenians, who found them worse and made them
better, from the day that he began to make speeches? for, indeed, I do not know
of such a man.


CALLICLES  What! did you never hear that Themistocles was a good man, and Cimon
and Miltiades and Pericles, who is just lately dead, and whom you heard
yourself?


SOCRATES  Yes, Callicles, they were good men, if, as you said at first, true
virtue consists only in the satisfaction of our own desires and those of
others; but if not, and if, as we were afterwards compelled to acknowledge, the
satisfaction of some desires makes us better, and of others, worse, and we
ought to gratify the one and not the other, and there is an art in
distinguishing them,âcan you tell me of any of these statesmen who did
distinguish them?


CALLICLES  No, indeed, I cannot.


SOCRATES  Yet, surely, Callicles, if you look you will find such a one. Suppose
that we just calmly consider whether any of these was such as I have described.
Will not the good man, who says whatever he says with a view to the best, speak
with a reference to some standard and not at random; just as all other artists,
whether the painter, the builder, the shipwright, or any other look all of them
to their own work, and do not select and apply at random what they apply, but
strive to give a definite form to it? The artist disposes all things in order,
and compels the one part to harmonize and accord with the other part, until he
has constructed a regular and systematic whole; and this is true of all
artists, and in the same way the trainers and physicians, of whom we spoke
before, give order and regularity to the body  do you deny this?


CALLICLES  No; I am ready to admit it.


SOCRATES  Then the house in which order and regularity prevail is good; that in
which there is disorder, evil?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And the same is true of a ship?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And the same may be said of the human body?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And what would you say of the soul? Will the good soul be that in
which disorder is prevalent, or that in which there is harmony and order?


CALLICLES  The latter follows from our previous admissions.


SOCRATES  What is the name which is given to the effect of harmony and order in
the body?


CALLICLES  I suppose that you mean health and strength?


SOCRATES  Yes, I do; and what is the name which you would give to the effect of
harmony and order in the soul? Try and discover a name for this as well as for
the other.


CALLICLES  Why not give the name yourself, Socrates?


SOCRATES  Well, if you had rather that I should, I will; and you shall say
whether you agree with me, and if not, you shall refute and answer me.
âHealthy,â as I conceive, is the name which is given to the regular
order of the body, whence comes health and every other bodily excellence  is
that true or not?


CALLICLES  True.


SOCRATES  And âlawfulâ and âlawâ are the names which
are given to the regular order and action of the soul, and these make men
lawful and orderly âand so we have temperance and justice  have we not?


CALLICLES  Granted.


SOCRATES  And will not the true rhetorician who is honest and understands his
art have his eye fixed upon these, in all the words which he addresses to the
souls of men, and in all his actions, both in what he gives and in what he
takes away? Will not his aim be to implant justice in the souls of his citizens
and take away injustice, to implant temperance and take away intemperance, to
implant every virtue and take away every vice? Do you not agree?


CALLICLES  I agree.


SOCRATES  For what use is there, Callicles, in giving to the body of a sick man
who is in a bad state of health a quantity of the most delightful food or drink
or any other pleasant thing, which may be really as bad for him as if you gave
him nothing, or even worse if rightly estimated. Is not that true?


CALLICLES  I will not say No to it.


SOCRATES  For in my opinion there is no profit in a manâs life if his
body is in an evil plightâin that case his life also is evil  am I not
right?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  When a man is in health the physicians will generally allow him to
eat when he is hungry and drink when he is thirsty, and to satisfy his desires
as he likes, but when he is sick they hardly suffer him to satisfy his desires
at all  even you will admit that?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And does not the same argument hold of the soul, my good sir? While
she is in a bad state and is senseless and intemperate and unjust and unholy,
her desires ought to be controlled, and she ought to be prevented from doing
anything which does not tend to her own improvement.


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  Such treatment will be better for the soul herself?


CALLICLES  To be sure.


SOCRATES  And to restrain her from her appetites is to chastise her?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  Then restraint or chastisement is better for the soul than
intemperance or the absence of control, which you were just now preferring?


CALLICLES  I do not understand you, Socrates, and I wish that you would ask
some one who does.


SOCRATES  Here is a gentleman who cannot endure to be improved or to subject
himself to that very chastisement of which the argument speaks!


CALLICLES  I do not heed a word of what you are saying, and have only answered
hitherto out of civility to Gorgias.


SOCRATES  What are we to do, then? Shall we break off in the middle?


CALLICLES  You shall judge for yourself.


SOCRATES  Well, but people say that âa tale should have a head and not
break off in the middle,â and I should not like to have the argument
going about without a head (compare Laws); please then to go on a little
longer, and put the head on.


CALLICLES  How tyrannical you are, Socrates! I wish that you and your argument
would rest, or that you would get some one else to argue with you.


SOCRATES  But who else is willing?âI want to finish the argument.


CALLICLES  Cannot you finish without my help, either talking straight on, or
questioning and answering yourself?


SOCRATES  Must I then say with Epicharmus, âTwo men spoke before, but now
one shall be enoughâ? I suppose that there is absolutely no help. And if
I am to carry on the enquiry by myself, I will first of all remark that not
only I but all of us should have an ambition to know what is true and what is
false in this matter, for the discovery of the truth is a common good. And now
I will proceed to argue according to my own notion. But if any of you think
that I arrive at conclusions which are untrue you must interpose and refute me,
for I do not speak from any knowledge of what I am saying; I am an enquirer
like yourselves, and therefore, if my opponent says anything which is of force,
I shall be the first to agree with him. I am speaking on the supposition that
the argument ought to be completed; but if you think otherwise let us leave off
and go our ways.


GORGIAS  I think, Socrates, that we should not go our ways until you have
completed the argument; and this appears to me to be the wish of the rest of
the company; I myself should very much like to hear what more you have to say.


SOCRATES  I too, Gorgias, should have liked to continue the argument with
Callicles, and then I might have given him an âAmphionâ in return
for his âZethusâ; but since you, Callicles, are unwilling to
continue, I hope that you will listen, and interrupt me if I seem to you to be
in error. And if you refute me, I shall not be angry with you as you are with
me, but I shall inscribe you as the greatest of benefactors on the tablets of
my soul.


CALLICLES  My good fellow, never mind me, but get on.


SOCRATES  Listen to me, then, while I recapitulate the argument âIs the
pleasant the same as the good? Not the same. Callicles and I are agreed about
that. And is the pleasant to be pursued for the sake of the good? or the good
for the sake of the pleasant? The pleasant is to be pursued for the sake of the
good. And that is pleasant at the presence of which we are pleased, and that is
good at the presence of which we are good? To be sure. And we are good, and all
good things whatever are good when some virtue is present in us or them? That,
Callicles, is my conviction. But the virtue of each thing, whether body or
soul, instrument or creature, when given to them in the best way comes to them
not by chance but as the result of the order and truth and art which are
imparted to them  Am I not right? I maintain that I am. And is not the virtue
of each thing dependent on order or arrangement? Yes, I say. And that which
makes a thing good is the proper order inhering in each thing? Such is my view.
And is not the soul which has an order of her own better than that which has no
order? Certainly. And the soul which has order is orderly? Of course. And that
which is orderly is temperate? Assuredly. And the temperate soul is good? No
other answer can I give, Callicles dear; have you any?


CALLICLES  Go on, my good fellow.


SOCRATES  Then I shall proceed to add, that if the temperate soul is the good
soul, the soul which is in the opposite condition, that is, the foolish and
intemperate, is the bad soul. Very true.


And will not the temperate man do what is proper, both in relation to the gods
and to men;âfor he would not be temperate if he did not? Certainly he
will do what is proper. In his relation to other men he will do what is just;
and in his relation to the gods he will do what is holy; and he who does what
is just and holy must be just and holy? Very true. And must he not be
courageous? for the duty of a temperate man is not to follow or to avoid what
he ought not, but what he ought, whether things or men or pleasures or pains,
and patiently to endure when he ought; and therefore, Callicles, the temperate
man, being, as we have described, also just and courageous and holy, cannot be
other than a perfectly good man, nor can the good man do otherwise than well
and perfectly whatever he does; and he who does well must of necessity be happy
and blessed, and the evil man who does evil, miserable  now this latter is he
whom you were applaudingâthe intemperate who is the opposite of the
temperate. Such is my position, and these things I affirm to be true. And if
they are true, then I further affirm that he who desires to be happy must
pursue and practise temperance and run away from intemperance as fast as his
legs will carry him  he had better order his life so as not to need punishment;
but if either he or any of his friends, whether private individual or city, are
in need of punishment, then justice must be done and he must suffer punishment,
if he would be happy. This appears to me to be the aim which a man ought to
have, and towards which he ought to direct all the energies both of himself and
of the state, acting so that he may have temperance and justice present with
him and be happy, not suffering his lusts to be unrestrained, and in the
never-ending desire satisfy them leading a robberâs life. Such a one is
the friend neither of God nor man, for he is incapable of communion, and he who
is incapable of communion is also incapable of friendship. And philosophers
tell us, Callicles, that communion and friendship and orderliness and
temperance and justice bind together heaven and earth and gods and men, and
that this universe is therefore called Cosmos or order, not disorder or
misrule, my friend. But although you are a philosopher you seem to me never to
have observed that geometrical equality is mighty, both among gods and men; you
think that you ought to cultivate inequality or excess, and do not care about
geometry.âWell, then, either the principle that the happy are made happy
by the possession of justice and temperance, and the miserable miserable by the
possession of vice, must be refuted, or, if it is granted, what will be the
consequences? All the consequences which I drew before, Callicles, and about
which you asked me whether I was in earnest when I said that a man ought to
accuse himself and his son and his friend if he did anything wrong, and that to
this end he should use his rhetoricâall those consequences are true. And
that which you thought that Polus was led to admit out of modesty is true,
viz., that, to do injustice, if more disgraceful than to suffer, is in that
degree worse; and the other position, which, according to Polus, Gorgias
admitted out of modesty, that he who would truly be a rhetorician ought to be
just and have a knowledge of justice, has also turned out to be true.


And now, these things being as we have said, let us proceed in the next place
to consider whether you are right in throwing in my teeth that I am unable to
help myself or any of my friends or kinsmen, or to save them in the extremity
of danger, and that I am in the power of another like an outlaw to whom any one
may do what he likes,âhe may box my ears, which was a brave saying of
yours; or take away my goods or banish me, or even do his worst and kill me; a
condition which, as you say, is the height of disgrace. My answer to you is one
which has been already often repeated, but may as well be repeated once more. I
tell you, Callicles, that to be boxed on the ears wrongfully is not the worst
evil which can befall a man, nor to have my purse or my body cut open, but that
to smite and slay me and mine wrongfully is far more disgraceful and more evil;
aye, and to despoil and enslave and pillage, or in any way at all to wrong me
and mine, is far more disgraceful and evil to the doer of the wrong than to me
who am the sufferer. These truths, which have been already set forth as I state
them in the previous discussion, would seem now to have been fixed and riveted
by us, if I may use an expression which is certainly bold, in words which are
like bonds of iron and adamant; and unless you or some other still more
enterprising hero shall break them, there is no possibility of denying what I
say. For my position has always been, that I myself am ignorant how these
things are, but that I have never met any one who could say otherwise, any more
than you can, and not appear ridiculous. This is my position still, and if what
I am saying is true, and injustice is the greatest of evils to the doer of
injustice, and yet there is if possible a greater than this greatest of evils
(compare Republic), in an unjust man not suffering retribution, what is that
defence of which the want will make a man truly ridiculous? Must not the
defence be one which will avert the greatest of human evils? And will not the
worst of all defences be that with which a man is unable to defend himself or
his family or his friends?âand next will come that which is unable to
avert the next greatest evil; thirdly that which is unable to avert the third
greatest evil; and so of other evils. As is the greatness of evil so is the
honour of being able to avert them in their several degrees, and the disgrace
of not being able to avert them. Am I not right Callicles?


CALLICLES  Yes, quite right.


SOCRATES  Seeing then that there are these two evils, the doing injustice and
the suffering injusticeâand we affirm that to do injustice is a greater,
and to suffer injustice a lesser evilâby what devices can a man succeed
in obtaining the two advantages, the one of not doing and the other of not
suffering injustice? must he have the power, or only the will to obtain them? I
mean to ask whether a man will escape injustice if he has only the will to
escape, or must he have provided himself with the power?


CALLICLES  He must have provided himself with the power; that is clear.


SOCRATES  And what do you say of doing injustice? Is the will only sufficient,
and will that prevent him from doing injustice, or must he have provided
himself with power and art; and if he have not studied and practised, will he
be unjust still? Surely you might say, Callicles, whether you think that Polus
and I were right in admitting the conclusion that no one does wrong
voluntarily, but that all do wrong against their will?


CALLICLES  Granted, Socrates, if you will only have done.


SOCRATES  Then, as would appear, power and art have to be provided in order
that we may do no injustice?


CALLICLES  Certainly.


SOCRATES  And what art will protect us from suffering injustice, if not wholly,
yet as far as possible? I want to know whether you agree with me; for I think
that such an art is the art of one who is either a ruler or even tyrant
himself, or the equal and companion of the ruling power.


CALLICLES  Well said, Socrates; and please to observe how ready I am to praise
you when you talk sense.


SOCRATES  Think and tell me whether you would approve of another view of mine 
To me every man appears to be most the friend of him who is most like to
himâlike to like, as ancient sages say  Would you not agree to this?


CALLICLES  I should.


SOCRATES  But when the tyrant is rude and uneducated, he may be expected to
fear any one who is his superior in virtue, and will never be able to be
perfectly friendly with him.


CALLICLES  That is true.


SOCRATES  Neither will he be the friend of any one who is greatly his inferior,
for the tyrant will despise him, and will never seriously regard him as a
friend.


CALLICLES  That again is true.


SOCRATES  Then the only friend worth mentioning, whom the tyrant can have, will
be one who is of the same character, and has the same likes and dislikes, and
is at the same time willing to be subject and subservient to him; he is the man
who will have power in the state, and no one will injure him with
impunity âis not that so?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And if a young man begins to ask how he may become great and
formidable, this would seem to be the wayâhe will accustom himself, from
his youth upward, to feel sorrow and joy on the same occasions as his master,
and will contrive to be as like him as possible?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And in this way he will have accomplished, as you and your friends
would say, the end of becoming a great man and not suffering injury?


CALLICLES  Very true.


SOCRATES  But will he also escape from doing injury? Must not the very opposite
be true,âif he is to be like the tyrant in his injustice, and to have
influence with him? Will he not rather contrive to do as much wrong as
possible, and not be punished?


CALLICLES  True.


SOCRATES  And by the imitation of his master and by the power which he thus
acquires will not his soul become bad and corrupted, and will not this be the
greatest evil to him?


CALLICLES  You always contrive somehow or other, Socrates, to invert
everything  do you not know that he who imitates the tyrant will, if he has a
mind, kill him who does not imitate him and take away his goods?


SOCRATES  Excellent Callicles, I am not deaf, and I have heard that a great
many times from you and from Polus and from nearly every man in the city, but I
wish that you would hear me too. I dare say that he will kill him if he has a
mindâthe bad man will kill the good and true.


CALLICLES  And is not that just the provoking thing?


SOCRATES  Nay, not to a man of sense, as the argument shows  do you think that
all our cares should be directed to prolonging life to the uttermost, and to
the study of those arts which secure us from danger always; like that art of
rhetoric which saves men in courts of law, and which you advise me to
cultivate?


CALLICLES  Yes, truly, and very good advice too.


SOCRATES  Well, my friend, but what do you think of swimming; is that an art of
any great pretensions?


CALLICLES  No, indeed.


SOCRATES  And yet surely swimming saves a man from death, and there are
occasions on which he must know how to swim. And if you despise the swimmers, I
will tell you of another and greater art, the art of the pilot, who not only
saves the souls of men, but also their bodies and properties from the extremity
of danger, just like rhetoric. Yet his art is modest and unpresuming  it has no
airs or pretences of doing anything extraordinary, and, in return for the same
salvation which is given by the pleader, demands only two obols, if he brings
us from Aegina to Athens, or for the longer voyage from Pontus or Egypt, at the
utmost two drachmae, when he has saved, as I was just now saying, the passenger
and his wife and children and goods, and safely disembarked them at the
Piraeus,âthis is the payment which he asks in return for so great a boon;
and he who is the master of the art, and has done all this, gets out and walks
about on the sea-shore by his ship in an unassuming way. For he is able to
reflect and is aware that he cannot tell which of his fellow-passengers he has
benefited, and which of them he has injured in not allowing them to be drowned.
He knows that they are just the same when he has disembarked them as when they
embarked, and not a whit better either in their bodies or in their souls; and
he considers that if a man who is afflicted by great and incurable bodily
diseases is only to be pitied for having escaped, and is in no way benefited by
him in having been saved from drowning, much less he who has great and
incurable diseases, not of the body, but of the soul, which is the more
valuable part of him; neither is life worth having nor of any profit to the bad
man, whether he be delivered from the sea, or the law-courts, or any other
devourer;âand so he reflects that such a one had better not live, for he
cannot live well. (Compare Republic.)


And this is the reason why the pilot, although he is our saviour, is not
usually conceited, any more than the engineer, who is not at all behind either
the general, or the pilot, or any one else, in his saving power, for he
sometimes saves whole cities. Is there any comparison between him and the
pleader? And if he were to talk, Callicles, in your grandiose style, he would
bury you under a mountain of words, declaring and insisting that we ought all
of us to be engine-makers, and that no other profession is worth thinking
about; he would have plenty to say. Nevertheless you despise him and his art,
and sneeringly call him an engine-maker, and you will not allow your daughters
to marry his son, or marry your son to his daughters. And yet, on your
principle, what justice or reason is there in your refusal? What right have you
to despise the engine-maker, and the others whom I was just now mentioning? I
know that you will say, âI am better, and better born.â But if the
better is not what I say, and virtue consists only in a man saving himself and
his, whatever may be his character, then your censure of the engine-maker, and
of the physician, and of the other arts of salvation, is ridiculous. O my
friend! I want you to see that the noble and the good may possibly be something
different from saving and being saved âMay not he who is truly a man
cease to care about living a certain time?âhe knows, as women say, that
no man can escape fate, and therefore he is not fond of life; he leaves all
that with God, and considers in what way he can best spend his appointed
term;âwhether by assimilating himself to the constitution under which he
lives, as you at this moment have to consider how you may become as like as
possible to the Athenian people, if you mean to be in their good graces, and to
have power in the state; whereas I want you to think and see whether this is
for the interest of either of us;âI would not have us risk that which is
dearest on the acquisition of this power, like the Thessalian enchantresses,
who, as they say, bring down the moon from heaven at the risk of their own
perdition. But if you suppose that any man will show you the art of becoming
great in the city, and yet not conforming yourself to the ways of the city,
whether for better or worse, then I can only say that you are mistaken,
Callides; for he who would deserve to be the true natural friend of the
Athenian Demus, aye, or of Pyrilampesâ darling who is called after them,
must be by nature like them, and not an imitator only. He, then, who will make
you most like them, will make you as you desire, a statesman and orator  for
every man is pleased when he is spoken to in his own language and spirit, and
dislikes any other. But perhaps you, sweet Callicles, may be of another mind.
What do you say?


CALLICLES  Somehow or other your words, Socrates, always appear to me to be
good words; and yet, like the rest of the world, I am not quite convinced by
them. (Compare Symp.  1 Alcib.)


SOCRATES  The reason is, Callicles, that the love of Demus which abides in your
soul is an adversary to me; but I dare say that if we recur to these same
matters, and consider them more thoroughly, you may be convinced for all that.
Please, then, to remember that there are two processes of training all things,
including body and soul; in the one, as we said, we treat them with a view to
pleasure, and in the other with a view to the highest good, and then we do not
indulge but resist them  was not that the distinction which we drew?


CALLICLES  Very true.


SOCRATES  And the one which had pleasure in view was just a vulgar
flattery âwas not that another of our conclusions?


CALLICLES  Be it so, if you will have it.


SOCRATES  And the other had in view the greatest improvement of that which was
ministered to, whether body or soul?


CALLICLES  Quite true.


SOCRATES  And must we not have the same end in view in the treatment of our
city and citizens? Must we not try and make them as good as possible? For we
have already discovered that there is no use in imparting to them any other
good, unless the mind of those who are to have the good, whether money, or
office, or any other sort of power, be gentle and good. Shall we say that?


CALLICLES  Yes, certainly, if you like.


SOCRATES  Well, then, if you and I, Callicles, were intending to set about some
public business, and were advising one another to undertake buildings, such as
walls, docks or temples of the largest size, ought we not to examine ourselves,
first, as to whether we know or do not know the art of building, and who taught
us?âwould not that be necessary, Callicles?


CALLICLES  True.


SOCRATES  In the second place, we should have to consider whether we had ever
constructed any private house, either of our own or for our friends, and
whether this building of ours was a success or not; and if upon consideration
we found that we had had good and eminent masters, and had been successful in
constructing many fine buildings, not only with their assistance, but without
them, by our own unaided skillâin that case prudence would not dissuade
us from proceeding to the construction of public works. But if we had no master
to show, and only a number of worthless buildings or none at all, then, surely,
it would be ridiculous in us to attempt public works, or to advise one another
to undertake them. Is not this true?


CALLICLES  Certainly.


SOCRATES  And does not the same hold in all other cases? If you and I were
physicians, and were advising one another that we were competent to practise as
state-physicians, should I not ask about you, and would you not ask about me,
Well, but how about Socrates himself, has he good health? and was any one else
ever known to be cured by him, whether slave or freeman? And I should make the
same enquiries about you. And if we arrived at the conclusion that no one,
whether citizen or stranger, man or woman, had ever been any the better for the
medical skill of either of us, then, by Heaven, Callicles, what an absurdity to
think that we or any human being should be so silly as to set up as
state-physicians and advise others like ourselves to do the same, without
having first practised in private, whether successfully or not, and acquired
experience of the art! Is not this, as they say, to begin with the big jar when
you are learning the potterâs art; which is a foolish thing?


CALLICLES  True.


SOCRATES  And now, my friend, as you are already beginning to be a public
character, and are admonishing and reproaching me for not being one, suppose
that we ask a few questions of one another. Tell me, then, Callicles, how about
making any of the citizens better? Was there ever a man who was once vicious,
or unjust, or intemperate, or foolish, and became by the help of Callicles good
and noble? Was there ever such a man, whether citizen or stranger, slave or
freeman? Tell me, Callicles, if a person were to ask these questions of you,
what would you answer? Whom would you say that you had improved by your
conversation? There may have been good deeds of this sort which were done by
you as a private person, before you came forward in public. Why will you not
answer?


CALLICLES  You are contentious, Socrates.


SOCRATES  Nay, I ask you, not from a love of contention, but because I really
want to know in what way you think that affairs should be administered among
usâwhether, when you come to the administration of them, you have any
other aim but the improvement of the citizens? Have we not already admitted
many times over that such is the duty of a public man? Nay, we have surely said
so; for if you will not answer for yourself I must answer for you. But if this
is what the good man ought to effect for the benefit of his own state, allow me
to recall to you the names of those whom you were just now mentioning,
Pericles, and Cimon, and Miltiades, and Themistocles, and ask whether you still
think that they were good citizens.


CALLICLES  I do.


SOCRATES  But if they were good, then clearly each of them must have made the
citizens better instead of worse?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And, therefore, when Pericles first began to speak in the assembly,
the Athenians were not so good as when he spoke last?


CALLICLES  Very likely.


SOCRATES  Nay, my friend, âlikelyâ is not the word; for if he was a
good citizen, the inference is certain.


CALLICLES  And what difference does that make?


SOCRATES  None; only I should like further to know whether the Athenians are
supposed to have been made better by Pericles, or, on the contrary, to have
been corrupted by him; for I hear that he was the first who gave the people
pay, and made them idle and cowardly, and encouraged them in the love of talk
and money.


CALLICLES  You heard that, Socrates, from the laconising set who bruise their
ears.


SOCRATES  But what I am going to tell you now is not mere hearsay, but well
known both to you and me  that at first, Pericles was glorious and his
character unimpeached by any verdict of the Atheniansâthis was during the
time when they were not so goodâyet afterwards, when they had been made
good and gentle by him, at the very end of his life they convicted him of
theft, and almost put him to death, clearly under the notion that he was a
malefactor.


CALLICLES  Well, but how does that prove Periclesâ badness?


SOCRATES  Why, surely you would say that he was a bad manager of asses or
horses or oxen, who had received them originally neither kicking nor butting
nor biting him, and implanted in them all these savage tricks? Would he not be
a bad manager of any animals who received them gentle, and made them fiercer
than they were when he received them? What do you say?


CALLICLES  I will do you the favour of saying âyes.â


SOCRATES  And will you also do me the favour of saying whether man is an
animal?


CALLICLES  Certainly he is.


SOCRATES  And was not Pericles a shepherd of men?


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  And if he was a good political shepherd, ought not the animals who
were his subjects, as we were just now acknowledging, to have become more just,
and not more unjust?


CALLICLES  Quite true.


SOCRATES  And are not just men gentle, as Homer says?âor are you of
another mind?


CALLICLES  I agree.


SOCRATES  And yet he really did make them more savage than he received them,
and their savageness was shown towards himself; which he must have been very
far from desiring.


CALLICLES  Do you want me to agree with you?


SOCRATES  Yes, if I seem to you to speak the truth.


CALLICLES  Granted then.


SOCRATES  And if they were more savage, must they not have been more unjust and
inferior?


CALLICLES  Granted again.


SOCRATES  Then upon this view, Pericles was not a good statesman?


CALLICLES  That is, upon your view.


SOCRATES  Nay, the view is yours, after what you have admitted. Take the case
of Cimon again. Did not the very persons whom he was serving ostracize him, in
order that they might not hear his voice for ten years? and they did just the
same to Themistocles, adding the penalty of exile; and they voted that
Miltiades, the hero of Marathon, should be thrown into the pit of death, and he
was only saved by the Prytanis. And yet, if they had been really good men, as
you say, these things would never have happened to them. For the good
charioteers are not those who at first keep their place, and then, when they
have broken-in their horses, and themselves become better charioteers, are
thrown outâthat is not the way either in charioteering or in any
profession.âWhat do you think?


CALLICLES  I should think not.


SOCRATES  Well, but if so, the truth is as I have said already, that in the
Athenian State no one has ever shown himself to be a good statesmanâyou
admitted that this was true of our present statesmen, but not true of former
ones, and you preferred them to the others; yet they have turned out to be no
better than our present ones; and therefore, if they were rhetoricians, they
did not use the true art of rhetoric or of flattery, or they would not have
fallen out of favour.


CALLICLES  But surely, Socrates, no living man ever came near any one of them
in his performances.


SOCRATES  O, my dear friend, I say nothing against them regarded as the
serving-men of the State; and I do think that they were certainly more
serviceable than those who are living now, and better able to gratify the
wishes of the State; but as to transforming those desires and not allowing them
to have their way, and using the powers which they had, whether of persuasion
or of force, in the improvement of their fellow citizens, which is the prime
object of the truly good citizen, I do not see that in these respects they were
a whit superior to our present statesmen, although I do admit that they were
more clever at providing ships and walls and docks, and all that. You and I
have a ridiculous way, for during the whole time that we are arguing, we are
always going round and round to the same point, and constantly misunderstanding
one another. If I am not mistaken, you have admitted and acknowledged more than
once, that there are two kinds of operations which have to do with the body,
and two which have to do with the soul  one of the two is ministerial, and if
our bodies are hungry provides food for them, and if they are thirsty gives
them drink, or if they are cold supplies them with garments, blankets, shoes,
and all that they crave. I use the same images as before intentionally, in
order that you may understand me the better. The purveyor of the articles may
provide them either wholesale or retail, or he may be the maker of any of
them,âthe baker, or the cook, or the weaver, or the shoemaker, or the
currier; and in so doing, being such as he is, he is naturally supposed by
himself and every one to minister to the body. For none of them know that there
is another artâan art of gymnastic and medicine which is the true
minister of the body, and ought to be the mistress of all the rest, and to use
their results according to the knowledge which she has and they have not, of
the real good or bad effects of meats and drinks on the body. All other arts
which have to do with the body are servile and menial and illiberal; and
gymnastic and medicine are, as they ought to be, their mistresses. Now, when I
say that all this is equally true of the soul, you seem at first to know and
understand and assent to my words, and then a little while afterwards you come
repeating, Has not the State had good and noble citizens? and when I ask you
who they are, you reply, seemingly quite in earnest, as if I had asked, Who are
or have been good trainers?âand you had replied, Thearion, the baker,
Mithoecus, who wrote the Sicilian cookery-book, Sarambus, the vintner  these
are ministers of the body, first-rate in their art; for the first makes
admirable loaves, the second excellent dishes, and the third capital
wine;âto me these appear to be the exact parallel of the statesmen whom
you mention. Now you would not be altogether pleased if I said to you, My
friend, you know nothing of gymnastics; those of whom you are speaking to me
are only the ministers and purveyors of luxury, who have no good or noble
notions of their art, and may very likely be filling and fattening menâs
bodies and gaining their approval, although the result is that they lose their
original flesh in the long run, and become thinner than they were before; and
yet they, in their simplicity, will not attribute their diseases and loss of
flesh to their entertainers; but when in after years the unhealthy surfeit
brings the attendant penalty of disease, he who happens to be near them at the
time, and offers them advice, is accused and blamed by them, and if they could
they would do him some harm; while they proceed to eulogize the men who have
been the real authors of the mischief. And that, Callicles, is just what you
are now doing. You praise the men who feasted the citizens and satisfied their
desires, and people say that they have made the city great, not seeing that the
swollen and ulcerated condition of the State is to be attributed to these elder
statesmen; for they have filled the city full of harbours and docks and walls
and revenues and all that, and have left no room for justice and temperance.
And when the crisis of the disorder comes, the people will blame the advisers
of the hour, and applaud Themistocles and Cimon and Pericles, who are the real
authors of their calamities; and if you are not careful they may assail you and
my friend Alcibiades, when they are losing not only their new acquisitions, but
also their original possessions; not that you are the authors of these
misfortunes of theirs, although you may perhaps be accessories to them. A great
piece of work is always being made, as I see and am told, now as of old; about
our statesmen. When the State treats any of them as malefactors, I observe that
there is a great uproar and indignation at the supposed wrong which is done to
them; âafter all their many services to the State, that they should
unjustly perish,ââso the tale runs. But the cry is all a lie; for
no statesman ever could be unjustly put to death by the city of which he is the
head. The case of the professed statesman is, I believe, very much like that of
the professed sophist; for the sophists, although they are wise men, are
nevertheless guilty of a strange piece of folly; professing to be teachers of
virtue, they will often accuse their disciples of wronging them, and defrauding
them of their pay, and showing no gratitude for their services. Yet what can be
more absurd than that men who have become just and good, and whose injustice
has been taken away from them, and who have had justice implanted in them by
their teachers, should act unjustly by reason of the injustice which is not in
them? Can anything be more irrational, my friends, than this? You, Callicles,
compel me to be a mob-orator, because you will not answer.


CALLICLES  And you are the man who cannot speak unless there is some one to
answer?


SOCRATES  I suppose that I can; just now, at any rate, the speeches which I am
making are long enough because you refuse to answer me. But I adjure you by the
god of friendship, my good sir, do tell me whether there does not appear to you
to be a great inconsistency in saying that you have made a man good, and then
blaming him for being bad?


CALLICLES  Yes, it appears so to me.


SOCRATES  Do you never hear our professors of education speaking in this
inconsistent manner?


CALLICLES  Yes, but why talk of men who are good for nothing?


SOCRATES  I would rather say, why talk of men who profess to be rulers, and
declare that they are devoted to the improvement of the city, and nevertheless
upon occasion declaim against the utter vileness of the city âdo you
think that there is any difference between one and the other? My good friend,
the sophist and the rhetorician, as I was saying to Polus, are the same, or
nearly the same; but you ignorantly fancy that rhetoric is a perfect thing, and
sophistry a thing to be despised; whereas the truth is, that sophistry is as
much superior to rhetoric as legislation is to the practice of law, or
gymnastic to medicine. The orators and sophists, as I am inclined to think, are
the only class who cannot complain of the mischief ensuing to themselves from
that which they teach others, without in the same breath accusing themselves of
having done no good to those whom they profess to benefit. Is not this a fact?


CALLICLES  Certainly it is.


SOCRATES  If they were right in saying that they make men better, then they are
the only class who can afford to leave their remuneration to those who have
been benefited by them. Whereas if a man has been benefited in any other way,
if, for example, he has been taught to run by a trainer, he might possibly
defraud him of his pay, if the trainer left the matter to him, and made no
agreement with him that he should receive money as soon as he had given him the
utmost speed; for not because of any deficiency of speed do men act unjustly,
but by reason of injustice.


CALLICLES  Very true.


SOCRATES  And he who removes injustice can be in no danger of being treated
unjustly  he alone can safely leave the honorarium to his pupils, if he be
really able to make them goodâam I not right? (Compare Protag.)


CALLICLES  Yes.


SOCRATES  Then we have found the reason why there is no dishonour in a man
receiving pay who is called in to advise about building or any other art?


CALLICLES  Yes, we have found the reason.


SOCRATES  But when the point is, how a man may become best himself, and best
govern his family and state, then to say that you will give no advice gratis is
held to be dishonourable?


CALLICLES  True.


SOCRATES  And why? Because only such benefits call forth a desire to requite
them, and there is evidence that a benefit has been conferred when the
benefactor receives a return; otherwise not. Is this true?


CALLICLES  It is.


SOCRATES  Then to which service of the State do you invite me? determine for
me. Am I to be the physician of the State who will strive and struggle to make
the Athenians as good as possible; or am I to be the servant and flatterer of
the State? Speak out, my good friend, freely and fairly as you did at first and
ought to do again, and tell me your entire mind.


CALLICLES  I say then that you should be the servant of the State.


SOCRATES  The flatterer? well, sir, that is a noble invitation.


CALLICLES  The Mysian, Socrates, or what you please. For if you refuse, the
consequences will beâ


SOCRATES  Do not repeat the old storyâthat he who likes will kill me and
get my money; for then I shall have to repeat the old answer, that he will be a
bad man and will kill the good, and that the money will be of no use to him,
but that he will wrongly use that which he wrongly took, and if wrongly,
basely, and if basely, hurtfully.


CALLICLES  How confident you are, Socrates, that you will never come to harm!
you seem to think that you are living in another country, and can never be
brought into a court of justice, as you very likely may be brought by some
miserable and mean person.


SOCRATES  Then I must indeed be a fool, Callicles, if I do not know that in the
Athenian State any man may suffer anything. And if I am brought to trial and
incur the dangers of which you speak, he will be a villain who brings me to
trialâof that I am very sure, for no good man would accuse the innocent.
Nor shall I be surprised if I am put to death. Shall I tell you why I
anticipate this?


CALLICLES  By all means.


SOCRATES  I think that I am the only or almost the only Athenian living who
practises the true art of politics; I am the only politician of my time. Now,
seeing that when I speak my words are not uttered with any view of gaining
favour, and that I look to what is best and not to what is most pleasant,
having no mind to use those arts and graces which you recommend, I shall have
nothing to say in the justice court. And you might argue with me, as I was
arguing with Polus âI shall be tried just as a physician would be tried
in a court of little boys at the indictment of the cook. What would he reply
under such circumstances, if some one were to accuse him, saying, âO my
boys, many evil things has this man done to you  he is the death of you,
especially of the younger ones among you, cutting and burning and starving and
suffocating you, until you know not what to do; he gives you the bitterest
potions, and compels you to hunger and thirst. How unlike the variety of meats
and sweets on which I feasted you!â What do you suppose that the
physician would be able to reply when he found himself in such a predicament?
If he told the truth he could only say, âAll these evil things, my boys,
I did for your health,â and then would there not just be a clamour among
a jury like that? How they would cry out!


CALLICLES  I dare say.


SOCRATES  Would he not be utterly at a loss for a reply?


CALLICLES  He certainly would.


SOCRATES  And I too shall be treated in the same way, as I well know, if I am
brought before the court. For I shall not be able to rehearse to the people the
pleasures which I have procured for them, and which, although I am not disposed
to envy either the procurers or enjoyers of them, are deemed by them to be
benefits and advantages. And if any one says that I corrupt young men, and
perplex their minds, or that I speak evil of old men, and use bitter words
towards them, whether in private or public, it is useless for me to reply, as I
truly might ââAll this I do for the sake of justice, and with a
view to your interest, my judges, and to nothing else.â And therefore
there is no saying what may happen to me.


CALLICLES  And do you think, Socrates, that a man who is thus defenceless is in
a good position?


SOCRATES  Yes, Callicles, if he have that defence, which as you have often
acknowledged he should haveâif he be his own defence, and have never said
or done anything wrong, either in respect of gods or men; and this has been
repeatedly acknowledged by us to be the best sort of defence. And if any one
could convict me of inability to defend myself or others after this sort, I
should blush for shame, whether I was convicted before many, or before a few,
or by myself alone; and if I died from want of ability to do so, that would
indeed grieve me. But if I died because I have no powers of flattery or
rhetoric, I am very sure that you would not find me repining at death. For no
man who is not an utter fool and coward is afraid of death itself, but he is
afraid of doing wrong. For to go to the world below having oneâs soul
full of injustice is the last and worst of all evils. And in proof of what I
say, if you have no objection, I should like to tell you a story.


CALLICLES  Very well, proceed; and then we shall have done.


SOCRATES  Listen, then, as story-tellers say, to a very pretty tale, which I
dare say that you may be disposed to regard as a fable only, but which, as I
believe, is a true tale, for I mean to speak the truth. Homer tells us (Il.),
how Zeus and Poseidon and Pluto divided the empire which they inherited from
their father. Now in the days of Cronos there existed a law respecting the
destiny of man, which has always been, and still continues to be in
Heaven,âthat he who has lived all his life in justice and holiness shall
go, when he is dead, to the Islands of the Blessed, and dwell there in perfect
happiness out of the reach of evil; but that he who has lived unjustly and
impiously shall go to the house of vengeance and punishment, which is called
Tartarus. And in the time of Cronos, and even quite lately in the reign of
Zeus, the judgment was given on the very day on which the men were to die; the
judges were alive, and the men were alive; and the consequence was that the
judgments were not well given. Then Pluto and the authorities from the Islands
of the Blessed came to Zeus, and said that the souls found their way to the
wrong places. Zeus said  âI shall put a stop to this; the judgments are
not well given, because the persons who are judged have their clothes on, for
they are alive; and there are many who, having evil souls, are apparelled in
fair bodies, or encased in wealth or rank, and, when the day of judgment
arrives, numerous witnesses come forward and testify on their behalf that they
have lived righteously. The judges are awed by them, and they themselves too
have their clothes on when judging; their eyes and ears and their whole bodies
are interposed as a veil before their own souls. All this is a hindrance to
them; there are the clothes of the judges and the clothes of the
judged.âWhat is to be done? I will tell you âIn the first place, I
will deprive men of the foreknowledge of death, which they possess at present 
this power which they have Prometheus has already received my orders to take
from them  in the second place, they shall be entirely stripped before they are
judged, for they shall be judged when they are dead; and the judge too shall be
naked, that is to say, deadâhe with his naked soul shall pierce into the
other naked souls; and they shall die suddenly and be deprived of all their
kindred, and leave their brave attire strewn upon the earthâconducted in
this manner, the judgment will be just. I knew all about the matter before any
of you, and therefore I have made my sons judges; two from Asia, Minos and
Rhadamanthus, and one from Europe, Aeacus. And these, when they are dead, shall
give judgment in the meadow at the parting of the ways, whence the two roads
lead, one to the Islands of the Blessed, and the other to Tartarus.
Rhadamanthus shall judge those who come from Asia, and Aeacus those who come
from Europe. And to Minos I shall give the primacy, and he shall hold a court
of appeal, in case either of the two others are in any doubt âthen the
judgment respecting the last journey of men will be as just as possible.â


From this tale, Callicles, which I have heard and believe, I draw the following
inferences âDeath, if I am right, is in the first place the separation
from one another of two things, soul and body; nothing else. And after they are
separated they retain their several natures, as in life; the body keeps the
same habit, and the results of treatment or accident are distinctly visible in
it  for example, he who by nature or training or both, was a tall man while he
was alive, will remain as he was, after he is dead; and the fat man will remain
fat; and so on; and the dead man, who in life had a fancy to have flowing hair,
will have flowing hair. And if he was marked with the whip and had the prints
of the scourge, or of wounds in him when he was alive, you might see the same
in the dead body; and if his limbs were broken or misshapen when he was alive,
the same appearance would be visible in the dead. And in a word, whatever was
the habit of the body during life would be distinguishable after death, either
perfectly, or in a great measure and for a certain time. And I should imagine
that this is equally true of the soul, Callicles; when a man is stripped of the
body, all the natural or acquired affections of the soul are laid open to
view.âAnd when they come to the judge, as those from Asia come to
Rhadamanthus, he places them near him and inspects them quite impartially, not
knowing whose the soul is  perhaps he may lay hands on the soul of the great
king, or of some other king or potentate, who has no soundness in him, but his
soul is marked with the whip, and is full of the prints and scars of perjuries
and crimes with which each action has stained him, and he is all crooked with
falsehood and imposture, and has no straightness, because he has lived without
truth. Him Rhadamanthus beholds, full of all deformity and disproportion, which
is caused by licence and luxury and insolence and incontinence, and despatches
him ignominiously to his prison, and there he undergoes the punishment which he
deserves.


Now the proper office of punishment is twofold  he who is rightly punished
ought either to become better and profit by it, or he ought to be made an
example to his fellows, that they may see what he suffers, and fear and become
better. Those who are improved when they are punished by gods and men, are
those whose sins are curable; and they are improved, as in this world so also
in another, by pain and suffering; for there is no other way in which they can
be delivered from their evil. But they who have been guilty of the worst
crimes, and are incurable by reason of their crimes, are made examples; for, as
they are incurable, the time has passed at which they can receive any benefit.
They get no good themselves, but others get good when they behold them enduring
for ever the most terrible and painful and fearful sufferings as the penalty of
their sinsâthere they are, hanging up as examples, in the prison-house of
the world below, a spectacle and a warning to all unrighteous men who come
thither. And among them, as I confidently affirm, will be found Archelaus, if
Polus truly reports of him, and any other tyrant who is like him. Of these
fearful examples, most, as I believe, are taken from the class of tyrants and
kings and potentates and public men, for they are the authors of the greatest
and most impious crimes, because they have the power. And Homer witnesses to
the truth of this; for they are always kings and potentates whom he has
described as suffering everlasting punishment in the world below  such were
Tantalus and Sisyphus and Tityus. But no one ever described Thersites, or any
private person who was a villain, as suffering everlasting punishment, or as
incurable. For to commit the worst crimes, as I am inclined to think, was not
in his power, and he was happier than those who had the power. No, Callicles,
the very bad men come from the class of those who have power (compare
Republic). And yet in that very class there may arise good men, and worthy of
all admiration they are, for where there is great power to do wrong, to live
and to die justly is a hard thing, and greatly to be praised, and few there are
who attain to this. Such good and true men, however, there have been, and will
be again, at Athens and in other states, who have fulfilled their trust
righteously; and there is one who is quite famous all over Hellas, Aristeides,
the son of Lysimachus. But, in general, great men are also bad, my friend.


As I was saying, Rhadamanthus, when he gets a soul of the bad kind, knows
nothing about him, neither who he is, nor who his parents are; he knows only
that he has got hold of a villain; and seeing this, he stamps him as curable or
incurable, and sends him away to Tartarus, whither he goes and receives his
proper recompense. Or, again, he looks with admiration on the soul of some just
one who has lived in holiness and truth; he may have been a private man or not;
and I should say, Callicles, that he is most likely to have been a philosopher
who has done his own work, and not troubled himself with the doings of other
men in his lifetime; him Rhadamanthus sends to the Islands of the Blessed.
Aeacus does the same; and they both have sceptres, and judge; but Minos alone
has a golden sceptre and is seated looking on, as Odysseus in Homer declares
that he saw him 


âHolding a sceptre of gold, and giving laws to the dead.â


Now I, Callicles, am persuaded of the truth of these things, and I consider how
I shall present my soul whole and undefiled before the judge in that day.
Renouncing the honours at which the world aims, I desire only to know the
truth, and to live as well as I can, and, when I die, to die as well as I can.
And, to the utmost of my power, I exhort all other men to do the same. And, in
return for your exhortation of me, I exhort you also to take part in the great
combat, which is the combat of life, and greater than every other earthly
conflict. And I retort your reproach of me, and say, that you will not be able
to help yourself when the day of trial and judgment, of which I was speaking,
comes upon you; you will go before the judge, the son of Aegina, and, when he
has got you in his grip and is carrying you off, you will gape and your head
will swim round, just as mine would in the courts of this world, and very
likely some one will shamefully box you on the ears, and put upon you any sort
of insult.


Perhaps this may appear to you to be only an old wifeâs tale, which you
will contemn. And there might be reason in your contemning such tales, if by
searching we could find out anything better or truer  but now you see that you
and Polus and Gorgias, who are the three wisest of the Greeks of our day, are
not able to show that we ought to live any life which does not profit in
another world as well as in this. And of all that has been said, nothing
remains unshaken but the saying, that to do injustice is more to be avoided
than to suffer injustice, and that the reality and not the appearance of virtue
is to be followed above all things, as well in public as in private life; and
that when any one has been wrong in anything, he is to be chastised, and that
the next best thing to a man being just is that he should become just, and be
chastised and punished; also that he should avoid all flattery of himself as
well as of others, of the few or of the many  and rhetoric and any other art
should be used by him, and all his actions should be done always, with a view
to justice.


Follow me then, and I will lead you where you will be happy in life and after
death, as the argument shows. And never mind if some one despises you as a
fool, and insults you, if he has a mind; let him strike you, by Zeus, and do
you be of good cheer, and do not mind the insulting blow, for you will never
come to any harm in the practice of virtue, if you are a really good and true
man. When we have practised virtue together, we will apply ourselves to
politics, if that seems desirable, or we will advise about whatever else may
seem good to us, for we shall be better able to judge then. In our present
condition we ought not to give ourselves airs, for even on the most important
subjects we are always changing our minds; so utterly stupid are we! Let us,
then, take the argument as our guide, which has revealed to us that the best
way of life is to practise justice and every virtue in life and death. This way
let us go; and in this exhort all men to follow, not in the way to which you
trust and in which you exhort me to follow you; for that way, Callicles, is
nothing worth.

                            <div class="sentence"> A marvel, indeed, Socrates, if you only knew how rhetoric comprehends and holds under her sway all the inferior arts.</div><div class="sentence">Let me offer you a striking example of this.</div><div class="sentence">On several occasions I have been with my brother Herodicus or some other physician to see one of his patients, who would not allow the physician to give him medicine, or apply the knife or hot iron to him; and I have persuaded him to do for me what he would not do for the physician just by the use of rhetoric.</div><div class="sentence">And I say that if a rhetorician and a physician were to go to any city, and had there to argue in the Ecclesia or any other assembly as to which of them should be elected state-physician, the physician would have no chance; but he who could speak would be chosen if he wished; and in a contest with a man of any other profession the rhetorician more than any one would have the power of getting himself chosen, for he can speak more persuasively to the multitude than any of them, and on any subject.</div><div class="sentence">Such is the nature and power of the art of rhetoric!</div><div class="sentence">And yet, Socrates, rhetoric should be used like any other competitive art, not against everybody,âthe rhetorician ought not to abuse his strength any more than a pugilist or pancratiast or other master of fence;âbecause he has powers which are more than a match either for friend or enemy, he ought not therefore to strike, stab, or slay his friends.</div><div class="sentence">Suppose a man to have been trained in the palestra and to be a skilful boxer,âhe in the fulness of his strength goes and strikes his father or mother or one of his familiars or friends; but that is no reason why the trainers or fencing-masters should be held in detestation or banished from the city;âsurely not.</div><div class="sentence">For they taught their art for a good purpose, to be used against enemies and evil-doers, in self-defence not in aggression, and others have perverted their instructions, and turned to a bad use their own strength and skill.</div><div class="sentence">But not on this account are the teachers bad, neither is the art in fault, or bad in itself; I should rather say that those who make a bad use of the art are to blame.</div><div class="sentence">And the same argument holds good of rhetoric; for the rhetorician can speak against all men and upon any subject,âin short, he can persuade the multitude better than any other man of anything which he pleases, but he should not therefore seek to defraud the physician or any other artist of his reputation merely because he has the power; he ought to use rhetoric fairly, as he would also use his athletic powers.</div><div class="sentence">And if after having become a rhetorician he makes a bad use of his strength and skill, his instructor surely ought not on that account to be held in detestation or banished.</div><div class="sentence">For he was intended by his teacher to make a good use of his instructions, but he abuses them.</div><div class="sentence">And therefore he is the person who ought to be held in detestation, banished, and put to death, and not his instructor.</div>

                            <div class="sentence"> O, my dear friend, I say nothing against them regarded as the serving-men of the State; and I do think that they were certainly more serviceable than those who are living now, and better able to gratify the wishes of the State; but as to transforming those desires and not allowing them to have their way, and using the powers which they had, whether of persuasion or of force, in the improvement of their fellow citizens, which is the prime object of the truly good citizen, I do not see that in these respects they were a whit superior to our present statesmen, although I do admit that they were more clever at providing ships and walls and docks, and all that.</div><div class="sentence">You and I have a ridiculous way, for during the whole time that we are arguing, we are always going round and round to the same point, and constantly misunderstanding one another.</div><div class="sentence">If I am not mistaken, you have admitted and acknowledged more than once, that there are two kinds of operations which have to do with the body, and two which have to do with the soul:  one of the two is ministerial, and if our bodies are hungry provides food for them, and if they are thirsty gives them drink, or if they are cold supplies them with garments, blankets, shoes, and all that they crave.</div><div class="sentence">I use the same images as before intentionally, in order that you may understand me the better.</div><div class="sentence">The purveyor of the articles may provide them either wholesale or retail, or he may be the maker of any of them,âthe baker, or the cook, or the weaver, or the shoemaker, or the currier; and in so doing, being such as he is, he is naturally supposed by himself and every one to minister to the body.</div><div class="sentence">For none of them know that there is another artâan art of gymnastic and medicine which is the true minister of the body, and ought to be the mistress of all the rest, and to use their results according to the knowledge which she has and they have not, of the real good or bad effects of meats and drinks on the body.</div><div class="sentence">All other arts which have to do with the body are servile and menial and illiberal; and gymnastic and medicine are, as they ought to be, their mistresses.</div><div class="sentence">Now, when I say that all this is equally true of the soul, you seem at first to know and understand and assent to my words, and then a little while afterwards you come repeating, Has not the State had good and noble citizens?</div><div class="sentence">and when I ask you who they are, you reply, seemingly quite in earnest, as if I had asked, Who are or have been good trainers?âand you had replied, Thearion, the baker, Mithoecus, who wrote the Sicilian cookery-book, Sarambus, the vintner:  these are ministers of the body, first-rate in their art; for the first makes admirable loaves, the second excellent dishes, and the third capital wine;âto me these appear to be the exact parallel of the statesmen whom you mention.</div><div class="sentence">Now you would not be altogether pleased if I said to you, My friend, you know nothing of gymnastics; those of whom you are speaking to me are only the ministers and purveyors of luxury, who have no good or noble notions of their art, and may very likely be filling and fattening menâs bodies and gaining their approval, although the result is that they lose their original flesh in the long run, and become thinner than they were before; and yet they, in their simplicity, will not attribute their diseases and loss of flesh to their entertainers; but when in after years the unhealthy surfeit brings the attendant penalty of disease, he who happens to be near them at the time, and offers them advice, is accused and blamed by them, and if they could they would do him some harm; while they proceed to eulogize the men who have been the real authors of the mischief.</div><div class="sentence">And that, Callicles, is just what you are now doing.</div><div class="sentence">You praise the men who feasted the citizens and satisfied their desires, and people say that they have made the city great, not seeing that the swollen and ulcerated condition of the State is to be attributed to these elder statesmen; for they have filled the city full of harbours and docks and walls and revenues and all that, and have left no room for justice and temperance.</div><div class="sentence">And when the crisis of the disorder comes, the people will blame the advisers of the hour, and applaud Themistocles and Cimon and Pericles, who are the real authors of their calamities; and if you are not careful they may assail you and my friend Alcibiades, when they are losing not only their new acquisitions, but also their original possessions; not that you are the authors of these misfortunes of theirs, although you may perhaps be accessories to them.</div><div class="sentence">A great piece of work is always being made, as I see and am told, now as of old; about our statesmen.</div><div class="sentence">When the State treats any of them as malefactors, I observe that there is a great uproar and indignation at the supposed wrong which is done to them; âafter all their many services to the State, that they should unjustly perish,ââso the tale runs.</div><div class="sentence">But the cry is all a lie; for no statesman ever could be unjustly put to death by the city of which he is the head.</div><div class="sentence">The case of the professed statesman is, I believe, very much like that of the professed sophist; for the sophists, although they are wise men, are nevertheless guilty of a strange piece of folly; professing to be teachers of virtue, they will often accuse their disciples of wronging them, and defrauding them of their pay, and showing no gratitude for their services.</div><div class="sentence">Yet what can be more absurd than that men who have become just and good, and whose injustice has been taken away from them, and who have had justice implanted in them by their teachers, should act unjustly by reason of the injustice which is not in them?</div><div class="sentence">Can anything be more irrational, my friends, than this?</div><div class="sentence">You, Callicles, compel me to be a mob-orator, because you will not answer.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> From this tale, Callicles, which I have heard and believe, I draw the following inferences:âDeath, if I am right, is in the first place the separation from one another of two things, soul and body; nothing else.</div><div class="sentence"> And after they are separated they retain their several natures, as in life; the body keeps the same habit, and the results of treatment or accident are distinctly visible in it: for example, he who by nature or training or both, was a tall man while he was alive, will remain as he was, after he is dead; and the fat man will remain fat; and so on; and the dead man, who in life had a fancy to have flowing hair, will have flowing hair.</div><div class="sentence"> And if he was marked with the whip and had the prints of the scourge, or of wounds in him when he was alive, you might see the same in the dead body; and if his limbs were broken or misshapen when he was alive, the same appearance would be visible in the dead.</div><div class="sentence"> And in a word, whatever was the habit of the body during life would be distinguishable after death, either perfectly, or in a great measure and for a certain time.</div><div class="sentence"> And I should imagine that this is equally true of the soul, Callicles; when a man is stripped of the body, all the natural or acquired affections of the soul are laid open to view.âAnd when they come to the judge, as those from Asia come to Rhadamanthus, he places them near him and inspects them quite impartially, not knowing whose the soul is: perhaps he may lay hands on the soul of the great king, or of some other king or potentate, who has no soundness in him, but his soul is marked with the whip, and is full of the prints and scars of perjuries and crimes with which each action has stained him, and he is all crooked with falsehood and imposture, and has no straightness, because he has lived without truth.</div><div class="sentence"> Him Rhadamanthus beholds, full of all deformity and disproportion, which is caused by licence and luxury and insolence and incontinence, and despatches him ignominiously to his prison, and there he undergoes the punishment which he deserves.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> Now the proper office of punishment is twofold: he who is rightly punished ought either to become better and profit by it, or he ought to be made an example to his fellows, that they may see what he suffers, and fear and become better.</div><div class="sentence"> Those who are improved when they are punished by gods and men, are those whose sins are curable; and they are improved, as in this world so also in another, by pain and suffering; for there is no other way in which they can be delivered from their evil.</div><div class="sentence"> But they who have been guilty of the worst crimes, and are incurable by reason of their crimes, are made examples; for, as they are incurable, the time has passed at which they can receive any benefit.</div><div class="sentence"> They get no good themselves, but others get good when they behold them enduring for ever the most terrible and painful and fearful sufferings as the penalty of their sinsâthere they are, hanging up as examples, in the prison-house of the world below, a spectacle and a warning to all unrighteous men who come thither.</div><div class="sentence"> And among them, as I confidently affirm, will be found Archelaus, if Polus truly reports of him, and any other tyrant who is like him.</div><div class="sentence"> Of these fearful examples, most, as I believe, are taken from the class of tyrants and kings and potentates and public men, for they are the authors of the greatest and most impious crimes, because they have the power.</div><div class="sentence"> And Homer witnesses to the truth of this; for they are always kings and potentates whom he has described as suffering everlasting punishment in the world below: such were Tantalus and Sisyphus and Tityus.</div><div class="sentence"> But no one ever described Thersites, or any private person who was a villain, as suffering everlasting punishment, or as incurable.</div><div class="sentence"> For to commit the worst crimes, as I am inclined to think, was not in his power, and he was happier than those who had the power.</div><div class="sentence"> No, Callicles, the very bad men come from the class of those who have power (compare Republic).</div><div class="sentence"> And yet in that very class there may arise good men, and worthy of all admiration they are, for where there is great power to do wrong, to live and to die justly is a hard thing, and greatly to be praised, and few there are who attain to this.</div><div class="sentence"> Such good and true men, however, there have been, and will be again, at Athens and in other states, who have fulfilled their trust righteously; and there is one who is quite famous all over Hellas, Aristeides, the son of Lysimachus.</div><div class="sentence"> But, in general, great men are also bad, my friend.</div>

                            <div class="sentence"> A marvel, indeed, Socrates, if you only knew how rhetoric comprehends and holds under her sway all the inferior arts.</div><div class="sentence">Let me offer you a striking example of this.</div><div class="sentence">On several occasions I have been with my brother Herodicus or some other physician to see one of his patients, who would not allow the physician to give him medicine, or apply the knife or hot iron to him; and I have persuaded him to do for me what he would not do for the physician just by the use of rhetoric.</div><div class="sentence">And I say that if a rhetorician and a physician were to go to any city, and had there to argue in the Ecclesia or any other assembly as to which of them should be elected state-physician, the physician would have no chance; but he who could speak would be chosen if he wished; and in a contest with a man of any other profession the rhetorician more than any one would have the power of getting himself chosen, for he can speak more persuasively to the multitude than any of them, and on any subject.</div><div class="sentence">Such is the nature and power of the art of rhetoric!</div><div class="sentence">And yet, Socrates, rhetoric should be used like any other competitive art, not against everybody,âthe rhetorician ought not to abuse his strength any more than a pugilist or pancratiast or other master of fence;âbecause he has powers which are more than a match either for friend or enemy, he ought not therefore to strike, stab, or slay his friends.</div><div class="sentence">Suppose a man to have been trained in the palestra and to be a skilful boxer,âhe in the fulness of his strength goes and strikes his father or mother or one of his familiars or friends; but that is no reason why the trainers or fencing-masters should be held in detestation or banished from the city;âsurely not.</div><div class="sentence">For they taught their art for a good purpose, to be used against enemies and evil-doers, in self-defence not in aggression, and others have perverted their instructions, and turned to a bad use their own strength and skill.</div><div class="sentence">But not on this account are the teachers bad, neither is the art in fault, or bad in itself; I should rather say that those who make a bad use of the art are to blame.</div><div class="sentence">And the same argument holds good of rhetoric; for the rhetorician can speak against all men and upon any subject,âin short, he can persuade the multitude better than any other man of anything which he pleases, but he should not therefore seek to defraud the physician or any other artist of his reputation merely because he has the power; he ought to use rhetoric fairly, as he would also use his athletic powers.</div><div class="sentence">And if after having become a rhetorician he makes a bad use of his strength and skill, his instructor surely ought not on that account to be held in detestation or banished.</div><div class="sentence">For he was intended by his teacher to make a good use of his instructions, but he abuses them.</div><div class="sentence">And therefore he is the person who ought to be held in detestation, banished, and put to death, and not his instructor.</div>

                            <div class="sentence"> O, my dear friend, I say nothing against them regarded as the serving-men of the State; and I do think that they were certainly more serviceable than those who are living now, and better able to gratify the wishes of the State; but as to transforming those desires and not allowing them to have their way, and using the powers which they had, whether of persuasion or of force, in the improvement of their fellow citizens, which is the prime object of the truly good citizen, I do not see that in these respects they were a whit superior to our present statesmen, although I do admit that they were more clever at providing ships and walls and docks, and all that.</div><div class="sentence">You and I have a ridiculous way, for during the whole time that we are arguing, we are always going round and round to the same point, and constantly misunderstanding one another.</div><div class="sentence">If I am not mistaken, you have admitted and acknowledged more than once, that there are two kinds of operations which have to do with the body, and two which have to do with the soul:  one of the two is ministerial, and if our bodies are hungry provides food for them, and if they are thirsty gives them drink, or if they are cold supplies them with garments, blankets, shoes, and all that they crave.</div><div class="sentence">I use the same images as before intentionally, in order that you may understand me the better.</div><div class="sentence">The purveyor of the articles may provide them either wholesale or retail, or he may be the maker of any of them,âthe baker, or the cook, or the weaver, or the shoemaker, or the currier; and in so doing, being such as he is, he is naturally supposed by himself and every one to minister to the body.</div><div class="sentence">For none of them know that there is another artâan art of gymnastic and medicine which is the true minister of the body, and ought to be the mistress of all the rest, and to use their results according to the knowledge which she has and they have not, of the real good or bad effects of meats and drinks on the body.</div><div class="sentence">All other arts which have to do with the body are servile and menial and illiberal; and gymnastic and medicine are, as they ought to be, their mistresses.</div><div class="sentence">Now, when I say that all this is equally true of the soul, you seem at first to know and understand and assent to my words, and then a little while afterwards you come repeating, Has not the State had good and noble citizens?</div><div class="sentence">and when I ask you who they are, you reply, seemingly quite in earnest, as if I had asked, Who are or have been good trainers?âand you had replied, Thearion, the baker, Mithoecus, who wrote the Sicilian cookery-book, Sarambus, the vintner:  these are ministers of the body, first-rate in their art; for the first makes admirable loaves, the second excellent dishes, and the third capital wine;âto me these appear to be the exact parallel of the statesmen whom you mention.</div><div class="sentence">Now you would not be altogether pleased if I said to you, My friend, you know nothing of gymnastics; those of whom you are speaking to me are only the ministers and purveyors of luxury, who have no good or noble notions of their art, and may very likely be filling and fattening menâs bodies and gaining their approval, although the result is that they lose their original flesh in the long run, and become thinner than they were before; and yet they, in their simplicity, will not attribute their diseases and loss of flesh to their entertainers; but when in after years the unhealthy surfeit brings the attendant penalty of disease, he who happens to be near them at the time, and offers them advice, is accused and blamed by them, and if they could they would do him some harm; while they proceed to eulogize the men who have been the real authors of the mischief.</div><div class="sentence">And that, Callicles, is just what you are now doing.</div><div class="sentence">You praise the men who feasted the citizens and satisfied their desires, and people say that they have made the city great, not seeing that the swollen and ulcerated condition of the State is to be attributed to these elder statesmen; for they have filled the city full of harbours and docks and walls and revenues and all that, and have left no room for justice and temperance.</div><div class="sentence">And when the crisis of the disorder comes, the people will blame the advisers of the hour, and applaud Themistocles and Cimon and Pericles, who are the real authors of their calamities; and if you are not careful they may assail you and my friend Alcibiades, when they are losing not only their new acquisitions, but also their original possessions; not that you are the authors of these misfortunes of theirs, although you may perhaps be accessories to them.</div><div class="sentence">A great piece of work is always being made, as I see and am told, now as of old; about our statesmen.</div><div class="sentence">When the State treats any of them as malefactors, I observe that there is a great uproar and indignation at the supposed wrong which is done to them; âafter all their many services to the State, that they should unjustly perish,ââso the tale runs.</div><div class="sentence">But the cry is all a lie; for no statesman ever could be unjustly put to death by the city of which he is the head.</div><div class="sentence">The case of the professed statesman is, I believe, very much like that of the professed sophist; for the sophists, although they are wise men, are nevertheless guilty of a strange piece of folly; professing to be teachers of virtue, they will often accuse their disciples of wronging them, and defrauding them of their pay, and showing no gratitude for their services.</div><div class="sentence">Yet what can be more absurd than that men who have become just and good, and whose injustice has been taken away from them, and who have had justice implanted in them by their teachers, should act unjustly by reason of the injustice which is not in them?</div><div class="sentence">Can anything be more irrational, my friends, than this?</div><div class="sentence">You, Callicles, compel me to be a mob-orator, because you will not answer.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> From this tale, Callicles, which I have heard and believe, I draw the following inferences:âDeath, if I am right, is in the first place the separation from one another of two things, soul and body; nothing else.</div><div class="sentence"> And after they are separated they retain their several natures, as in life; the body keeps the same habit, and the results of treatment or accident are distinctly visible in it: for example, he who by nature or training or both, was a tall man while he was alive, will remain as he was, after he is dead; and the fat man will remain fat; and so on; and the dead man, who in life had a fancy to have flowing hair, will have flowing hair.</div><div class="sentence"> And if he was marked with the whip and had the prints of the scourge, or of wounds in him when he was alive, you might see the same in the dead body; and if his limbs were broken or misshapen when he was alive, the same appearance would be visible in the dead.</div><div class="sentence"> And in a word, whatever was the habit of the body during life would be distinguishable after death, either perfectly, or in a great measure and for a certain time.</div><div class="sentence"> And I should imagine that this is equally true of the soul, Callicles; when a man is stripped of the body, all the natural or acquired affections of the soul are laid open to view.âAnd when they come to the judge, as those from Asia come to Rhadamanthus, he places them near him and inspects them quite impartially, not knowing whose the soul is: perhaps he may lay hands on the soul of the great king, or of some other king or potentate, who has no soundness in him, but his soul is marked with the whip, and is full of the prints and scars of perjuries and crimes with which each action has stained him, and he is all crooked with falsehood and imposture, and has no straightness, because he has lived without truth.</div><div class="sentence"> Him Rhadamanthus beholds, full of all deformity and disproportion, which is caused by licence and luxury and insolence and incontinence, and despatches him ignominiously to his prison, and there he undergoes the punishment which he deserves.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> Now the proper office of punishment is twofold: he who is rightly punished ought either to become better and profit by it, or he ought to be made an example to his fellows, that they may see what he suffers, and fear and become better.</div><div class="sentence"> Those who are improved when they are punished by gods and men, are those whose sins are curable; and they are improved, as in this world so also in another, by pain and suffering; for there is no other way in which they can be delivered from their evil.</div><div class="sentence"> But they who have been guilty of the worst crimes, and are incurable by reason of their crimes, are made examples; for, as they are incurable, the time has passed at which they can receive any benefit.</div><div class="sentence"> They get no good themselves, but others get good when they behold them enduring for ever the most terrible and painful and fearful sufferings as the penalty of their sinsâthere they are, hanging up as examples, in the prison-house of the world below, a spectacle and a warning to all unrighteous men who come thither.</div><div class="sentence"> And among them, as I confidently affirm, will be found Archelaus, if Polus truly reports of him, and any other tyrant who is like him.</div><div class="sentence"> Of these fearful examples, most, as I believe, are taken from the class of tyrants and kings and potentates and public men, for they are the authors of the greatest and most impious crimes, because they have the power.</div><div class="sentence"> And Homer witnesses to the truth of this; for they are always kings and potentates whom he has described as suffering everlasting punishment in the world below: such were Tantalus and Sisyphus and Tityus.</div><div class="sentence"> But no one ever described Thersites, or any private person who was a villain, as suffering everlasting punishment, or as incurable.</div><div class="sentence"> For to commit the worst crimes, as I am inclined to think, was not in his power, and he was happier than those who had the power.</div><div class="sentence"> No, Callicles, the very bad men come from the class of those who have power (compare Republic).</div><div class="sentence"> And yet in that very class there may arise good men, and worthy of all admiration they are, for where there is great power to do wrong, to live and to die justly is a hard thing, and greatly to be praised, and few there are who attain to this.</div><div class="sentence"> Such good and true men, however, there have been, and will be again, at Athens and in other states, who have fulfilled their trust righteously; and there is one who is quite famous all over Hellas, Aristeides, the son of Lysimachus.</div><div class="sentence"> But, in general, great men are also bad, my friend.</div>
