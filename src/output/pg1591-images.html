                        <div class="sentence"> The Protagoras, like several of the Dialogues of Plato, is put into the mouth of Socrates, who describes a conversation which had taken place between himself and the great Sophist at the house of Callias—'the man who had spent more upon the Sophists than all the rest of the world'—and in which the learned Hippias and the grammarian Prodicus had also shared, as well as Alcibiades and Critias, both of whom said a few words—in the presence of a distinguished company consisting of disciples of Protagoras and of leading Athenians belonging to the Socratic circle.</div><div class="sentence"> The dialogue commences with a request on the part of Hippocrates that Socrates would introduce him to the celebrated teacher.</div><div class="sentence"> He has come before the dawn had risen—so fervid is his zeal.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates moderates his excitement and advises him to find out 'what Protagoras will make of him,' before he becomes his pupil.</div>
                    </div>
                 <div class="text">

                        <div class="sentence"> They go together to the house of Callias; and Socrates, after explaining the purpose of their visit to Protagoras, asks the question, 'What he will make of Hippocrates.'</div><div class="sentence"> Protagoras answers, 'That he will make him a better and a wiser man.'</div><div class="sentence"> 'But in what will he be better?</div><div class="sentence"> '—Socrates desires to have a more precise answer.</div><div class="sentence"> Protagoras replies, 'That he will teach him prudence in affairs private and public; in short, the science or knowledge of human life.'</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> This, as Socrates admits, is a noble profession; but he is or rather would have been doubtful, whether such knowledge can be taught, if Protagoras had not assured him of the fact, for two reasons: (1) Because the Athenian people, who recognize in their assemblies the distinction between the skilled and the unskilled in the arts, do not distinguish between the trained politician and the untrained; (2) Because the wisest and best Athenian citizens do not teach their sons political virtue.</div><div class="sentence"> Will Protagoras answer these objections?</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> Protagoras explains his views in the form of an apologue, in which, after Prometheus had given men the arts, Zeus is represented as sending Hermes to them, bearing with him Justice and Reverence.</div><div class="sentence"> These are not, like the arts, to be imparted to a few only, but all men are to be partakers of them.</div><div class="sentence"> Therefore the Athenian people are right in distinguishing between the skilled and unskilled in the arts, and not between skilled and unskilled politicians.</div><div class="sentence"> (1) For all men have the political virtues to a certain degree, and are obliged to say that they have them, whether they have them or not.</div><div class="sentence"> A man would be thought a madman who professed an art which he did not know; but he would be equally thought a madman if he did not profess a virtue which he had not.</div><div class="sentence"> (2) And that the political virtues can be taught and acquired, in the opinion of the Athenians, is proved by the fact that they punish evil-doers, with a view to prevention, of course—mere retribution is for beasts, and not for men.</div><div class="sentence"> (3) Again, would parents who teach her sons lesser matters leave them ignorant of the common duty of citizens?</div><div class="sentence"> To the doubt of Socrates the best answer is the fact, that the education of youth in virtue begins almost as soon as they can speak, and is continued by the state when they pass out of the parental control.</div><div class="sentence"> (4) Nor need we wonder that wise and good fathers sometimes have foolish and worthless sons.</div><div class="sentence"> Virtue, as we were saying, is not the private possession of any man, but is shared by all, only however to the extent of which each individual is by nature capable.</div><div class="sentence"> And, as a matter of fact, even the worst of civilized mankind will appear virtuous and just, if we compare them with savages.</div><div class="sentence"> (5) The error of Socrates lies in supposing that there are no teachers of virtue, whereas all men are teachers in a degree.</div><div class="sentence"> Some, like Protagoras, are better than others, and with this result we ought to be satisfied.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> Socrates is highly delighted with the explanation of Protagoras.</div><div class="sentence"> But he has still a doubt lingering in his mind.</div><div class="sentence"> Protagoras has spoken of the virtues: are they many, or one?</div><div class="sentence"> are they parts of a whole, or different names of the same thing?</div><div class="sentence"> Protagoras replies that they are parts, like the parts of a face, which have their several functions, and no one part is like any other part.</div><div class="sentence"> This admission, which has been somewhat hastily made, is now taken up and cross-examined by Socrates:—</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> Protagoras, whose temper begins to get a little ruffled at the process to which he has been subjected, is aware that he will soon be compelled by the dialectics of Socrates to admit that the temperate is the just.</div><div class="sentence"> He therefore defends himself with his favourite weapon; that is to say, he makes a long speech not much to the point, which elicits the applause of the audience.</div>
                    </div>
                 <div class="text">

                        <div class="sentence"> Here occurs a sort of interlude, which commences with a declaration on the part of Socrates that he cannot follow a long speech, and therefore he must beg Protagoras to speak shorter.</div><div class="sentence"> As Protagoras declines to accommodate him, he rises to depart, but is detained by Callias, who thinks him unreasonable in not allowing Protagoras the liberty which he takes himself of speaking as he likes.</div><div class="sentence"> But Alcibiades answers that the two cases are not parallel.</div><div class="sentence"> For Socrates admits his inability to speak long; will Protagoras in like manner acknowledge his inability to speak short?</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> The Lacedaemonians are great philosophers (although this is a fact which is not generally known); and the soul of their philosophy is brevity, which was also the style of primitive antiquity and of the seven sages.</div><div class="sentence"> Now Pittacus had a saying, 'Hard is it to be good:' and Simonides, who was jealous of the fame of this saying, wrote a poem which was designed to controvert it.</div><div class="sentence"> No, says he, Pittacus; not 'hard to be good,' but 'hard to become good.'</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates proceeds to argue in a highly impressive manner that the whole composition is intended as an attack upon Pittacus.</div><div class="sentence"> This, though manifestly absurd, is accepted by the company, and meets with the special approval of Hippias, who has however a favourite interpretation of his own, which he is requested by Alcibiades to defer.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> The argument is now resumed, not without some disdainful remarks of Socrates on the practice of introducing the poets, who ought not to be allowed, any more than flute-girls, to come into good society.</div><div class="sentence"> Men's own thoughts should supply them with the materials for discussion.</div><div class="sentence"> A few soothing flatteries are addressed to Protagoras by Callias and Socrates, and then the old question is repeated, 'Whether the virtues are one or many?'</div><div class="sentence"> To which Protagoras is now disposed to reply, that four out of the five virtues are in some degree similar; but he still contends that the fifth, courage, is unlike the rest.</div><div class="sentence"> Socrates proceeds to undermine the last stronghold of the adversary, first obtaining from him the admission that all virtue is in the highest degree good:—</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> Then now, I said, I will endeavour to explain to you my opinion about this poem of Simonides.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a very ancient philosophy which is more cultivated in Crete and Lacedaemon than in any other part of Hellas, and there are more philosophers in those countries than anywhere else in the world.</div><div class="sentence"> This, however, is a secret which the Lacedaemonians deny; and they pretend to be ignorant, just because they do not wish to have it thought that they rule the world by wisdom, like the Sophists of whom Protagoras was speaking, and not by valour of arms; considering that if the reason of their superiority were disclosed, all men would be practising their wisdom.</div><div class="sentence"> And this secret of theirs has never been discovered by the imitators of Lacedaemonian fashions in other cities, who go about with their ears bruised in imitation of them, and have the caestus bound on their arms, and are always in training, and wear short cloaks; for they imagine that these are the practices which have enabled the Lacedaemonians to conquer the other Hellenes.</div><div class="sentence"> Now when the Lacedaemonians want to unbend and hold free conversation with their wise men, and are no longer satisfied with mere secret intercourse, they drive out all these laconizers, and any other foreigners who may happen to be in their country, and they hold a philosophical seance unknown to strangers; and they themselves forbid their young men to go out into other cities—in this they are like the Cretans—in order that they may not unlearn the lessons which they have taught them.</div><div class="sentence"> And in Lacedaemon and Crete not only men but also women have a pride in their high cultivation.</div><div class="sentence"> And hereby you may know that I am right in attributing to the Lacedaemonians this excellence in philosophy and speculation: If a man converses with the most ordinary Lacedaemonian, he will find him seldom good for much in general conversation, but at any point in the discourse he will be darting out some notable saying, terse and full of meaning, with unerring aim; and the person with whom he is talking seems to be like a child in his hands.</div><div class="sentence"> And many of our own age and of former ages have noted that the true Lacedaemonian type of character has the love of philosophy even stronger than the love of gymnastics; they are conscious that only a perfectly educated man is capable of uttering such expressions.</div><div class="sentence"> Such were Thales of Miletus, and Pittacus of Mitylene, and Bias of Priene, and our own Solon, and Cleobulus the Lindian, and Myson the Chenian; and seventh in the catalogue of wise men was the Lacedaemonian Chilo.</div><div class="sentence"> All these were lovers and emulators and disciples of the culture of the Lacedaemonians, and any one may perceive that their wisdom was of this character; consisting of short memorable sentences, which they severally uttered.</div><div class="sentence"> And they met together and dedicated in the temple of Apollo at Delphi, as the first-fruits of their wisdom, the far-famed inscriptions, which are in all men's mouths—'Know thyself,' and 'Nothing too much.'</div>
