Two principles are indicated by him: first, that there is a distinction of ranks dependent on circumstances prior to the individual: second, that this distinction is and ought to be broken through by personal qualities.</div><div class="sentence"> He adapts mythology like the Homeric poems to the wants of the state, making ‘the Phoenician tale’ the vehicle of his ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> Every Greek state had a myth respecting its own origin; the Platonic republic may also have a tale of earthborn men.</div><div class="sentence"> The gravity and verisimilitude with which the tale is told, and the analogy of Greek tradition, are a sufficient verification of the ‘monstrous falsehood.’ Ancient poetry had spoken of a gold and silver and brass and iron age succeeding one another, but Plato supposes these differences in the natures of men to exist together in a single state.</div><div class="sentence"> Mythology supplies a figure under which the lesson may be taught (as Protagoras says, ‘the myth is more interesting’), and also enables Plato to touch lightly on new principles without going into details.</div><div class="sentence"> In this passage he shadows forth a general truth, but he does not tell us by what steps the transposition of ranks is to be effected.</div><div class="sentence"> Indeed throughout the Republic he allows the lower ranks to fade into the distance.</div><div class="sentence"> We do not know whether they are to carry arms, and whether in the fifth book they are or are not included in the communistic regulations respecting property and marriage.</div><div class="sentence"> Nor is there any use in arguing strictly either from a few chance words, or from the silence of Plato, or in drawing inferences which were beyond his vision.</div><div class="sentence"> Aristotle, in his criticism on the position of the lower classes, does not perceive that the poetical creation is ‘like the air, invulnerable,’ and cannot be penetrated by the shafts of his logic (Pol.</div><div class="sentence"> 2, 5, 18 foll.</div><div class="sentence"> ).</div>

but the truer and longer way would take up too much of our time.</div><div class="sentence"> ‘The shorter will satisfy me.’ Well then, you would admit that the qualities of states mean the qualities of the individuals who compose them?</div><div class="sentence"> The Scythians and Thracians are passionate, our own race intellectual, 436and the Egyptians and Phoenicians covetous, because the individual members of each have such and such a character; the difficulty is to determine whether the several principles are one or three; whether, that is to say, we reason with one part of our nature, desire with another, are angry with another, or whether the whole soul comes into play in each sort of action.</div><div class="sentence"> This enquiry, however, requires a very exact definition of terms.</div><div class="sentence"> The same thing in the same relation cannot be affected in two opposite ways.</div><div class="sentence"> But there is no impossibility in a man standing still, yet moving his arms, or in a top which is fixed on one spot going round upon its axis.</div><div class="sentence"> There is no necessity to mention all the possible exceptions; 437let us provisionally assume that opposites cannot do or be or suffer opposites in the same relation.</div><div class="sentence"> And to the class of opposites belong assent and dissent, desire and avoidance.</div><div class="sentence"> And one form lxv of desire is thirst and hunger: and here arises a new point—thirst is thirst of drink, hunger is hunger of food; not of warm drink or of a particular kind of food, 438with the single exception of course that the very fact of our desiring anything implies that it is good.</div><div class="sentence"> When relative terms have no attributes, their correlatives have no attributes; when they have attributes, their correlatives also have them.</div><div class="sentence"> For example, the term ‘greater’ is simply relative to ‘less,’ and knowledge refers to a subject of knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> But on the other hand, a particular knowledge is of a particular subject.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, every science has a distinct character, which is defined by an object; medicine, for example, is the science of health, although not to be confounded with health.</div><div class="sentence"> 439Having cleared our ideas thus far, let us return to the original instance of thirst, which has a definite object—drink.</div><div class="sentence"> Now the thirsty soul may feel two distinct impulses; the animal one saying ‘Drink;’ the rational one, which says ‘Do not drink.’ The two impulses are contradictory; and therefore we may assume that they spring from distinct principles in the soul.</div><div class="sentence"> But is passion a third principle, or akin to desire?</div><div class="sentence"> There is a story of a certain Leontius which throws some light on this question.</div><div class="sentence"> He was coming up from the Piraeus outside the north wall, and he passed a spot where there were dead bodies lying by the executioner.</div><div class="sentence"> He felt a longing desire to see them and also an abhorrence of them; at first he turned away and shut his eyes, then, 440suddenly tearing them open, he said,—‘Take your fill, ye wretches, of the fair sight.’ Now is there not here a third principle which is often found to come to the assistance of reason against desire, but never of desire against reason?</div><div class="sentence"> This is passion or spirit, of the separate existence of which we may further convince ourselves by putting the following case:—When a man suffers justly, if he be of a generous nature he is not indignant at the hardships which he undergoes: but when he suffers unjustly, his indignation is his great support; hunger and thirst cannot tame him; the spirit within him must do or die, until the voice of the shepherd, that is, of reason, bidding his dog bark no more, is heard within.</div><div class="sentence"> This shows that passion is the ally of reason.</div><div class="sentence"> 441Is passion then the same with reason?</div><div class="sentence"> No, for the former exists in children and brutes; and Homer affords a proof of the distinction between them when he says, ‘He smote his breast, and thus rebuked his soul.’</div>

whereas weak natures hardly ever do any considerable good or harm; they are not the stuff out of which either great criminals or great heroes are made.</div><div class="sentence"> 492The philosopher follows the same analogy: he is either the best or the worst of all men.</div><div class="sentence"> Some persons say that the Sophists are the corrupters of youth; but is not public opinion the real Sophist who is everywhere present—in those very persons, in the assembly, in the courts, in the camp, in the applauses and hisses of the theatre re-echoed by the surrounding hills?</div><div class="sentence"> Will not a young man’s heart leap amid these discordant sounds?</div><div class="sentence"> and will any education save him from being carried away by the torrent?</div><div class="sentence"> Nor is this all.</div><div class="sentence"> For if he will not yield to opinion, there follows the gentle compulsion of exile or death.</div><div class="sentence"> What principle of rival Sophists or anybody else can overcome in such an unequal contest?</div><div class="sentence"> Characters there may be more than human, 493who are exceptions—God may save a man, but not his own strength.</div><div class="sentence"> Further, I would have you consider that the hireling Sophist only gives back to the world their own opinions; he is the keeper of the monster, who knows how to flatter or anger him, and observes the meaning of his inarticulate grunts.</div><div class="sentence"> Good is what pleases him, evil what he dislikes; truth and beauty are determined only by the taste of the brute.</div><div class="sentence"> Such is the Sophist’s wisdom, and such is the condition of those who make public opinion the test of truth, whether in art or in morals.</div><div class="sentence"> The curse is laid upon them of being and doing what it approves, and when they attempt first principles the failure is ludicrous.</div><div class="sentence"> Think of all this and ask yourself whether the world is more likely to be a believer in the unity of the idea, or in the multiplicity of phenomena.</div><div class="sentence"> And the world if not a believer lxxxiii in the idea cannot be a philosopher, 494and must therefore be a persecutor of philosophers.</div><div class="sentence"> There is another evil:—the world does not like to lose the gifted nature, and so they flatter the young [Alcibiades] into a magnificent opinion of his own capacity; the tall, proper youth begins to expand, and is dreaming of kingdoms and empires.</div><div class="sentence"> If at this instant a friend whispers to him, ‘Now the gods lighten thee; thou art a great fool’ and must be educated—do you think that he will listen?</div><div class="sentence"> Or suppose a better sort of man who is attracted towards philosophy, will they not make Herculean efforts to spoil and corrupt him?</div><div class="sentence"> 495Are we not right in saying that the love of knowledge, no less than riches, may divert him?</div><div class="sentence"> Men of this class [Critias] often become politicians—they are the authors of great mischief in states, and sometimes also of great good.</div><div class="sentence"> And thus philosophy is deserted by her natural protectors, and others enter in and dishonour her.</div><div class="sentence"> Vulgar little minds see the land open and rush from the prisons of the arts into her temple.</div><div class="sentence"> A clever mechanic having a soul coarse as his body, thinks that he will gain caste by becoming her suitor.</div><div class="sentence"> For philosophy, even in her fallen estate, has a dignity of her own—and he, like a bald little blacksmith’s apprentice as he is, having made some money and got out of durance, washes and dresses himself as a bridegroom and marries his master’s daughter.</div><div class="sentence"> 496What will be the issue of such marriages?</div><div class="sentence"> Will they not be vile and bastard, devoid of truth and nature?</div><div class="sentence"> ‘They will.’ Small, then, is the remnant of genuine philosophers; there may be a few who are citizens of small states, in which politics are not worth thinking of, or who have been detained by Theages’ bridle of ill health; for my own case of the oracular sign is almost unique, and too rare to be worth mentioning.</div><div class="sentence"> And these few when they have tasted the pleasures of philosophy, and have taken a look at that den of thieves and place of wild beasts, which is human life, will stand aside from the storm under the shelter of a wall, and try to preserve their own innocence and to depart in peace.</div><div class="sentence"> ‘A great work, too, will have been accomplished by them.’ Great, yes, but not the greatest; for man is a social being, and can only attain his highest development in the society which is best suited to him.</div>

the stolid, fearless, nature is averse to intellectual toil.</div><div class="sentence"> And yet these opposite elements are all necessary, and therefore, as we were saying before, the aspirant must be tested in pleasures and dangers; and also, as we must now further add, 504in the highest branches of knowledge.</div><div class="sentence"> You will remember, that when we spoke of the virtues mention was made of a longer road, which you were satisfied to leave unexplored.</div><div class="sentence"> ‘Enough seemed to have been said.’ Enough, my friend; but what is enough while anything remains wanting?</div><div class="sentence"> Of all men the guardian must not faint in the search after truth; he must be prepared to take the longer road, or he will never reach that higher region which is above the four virtues; and of the virtues too he must not only get an outline, but a clear and distinct vision.</div><div class="sentence"> (Strange that we should be so precise about trifles, so careless about the highest truths!)</div><div class="sentence"> ‘And what are the highest?’ 505You to pretend unconsciousness, when you have so often heard me speak of the idea of good, about which we know so little, and without which though a man gain the world he has no profit of it!</div><div class="sentence"> Some people imagine that the good is wisdom; but this involves a circle,—the good, they say, is wisdom, wisdom has to do with the good.</div><div class="sentence"> According to others the good is pleasure; but then comes the absurdity that good is bad, for there are bad pleasures as well as good.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, the good must have reality; a man may desire the appearance of virtue, but he will not desire the appearance of good.</div><div class="sentence"> Ought our guardians then to be ignorant of this supreme principle, 506of which every man has a presentiment, and without which no man has any real knowledge of anything?</div><div class="sentence"> ‘But, Socrates, what is this supreme principle, knowledge or pleasure, or what?</div><div class="sentence"> You may think me troublesome, but I say that you have no business to be always lxxxvii repeating the doctrines of others instead of giving us your own.’ Can I say what I do not know?</div><div class="sentence"> ‘You may offer an opinion.’ And will the blindness and crookedness of opinion content you when you might have the light and certainty of science?</div><div class="sentence"> ‘I will only ask you to give such an explanation of the good as you have given already of temperance and justice.’ I wish that I could, but in my present mood I cannot reach to the height of the knowledge of the good.</div><div class="sentence"> 507To the parent or principal I cannot introduce you, but to the child begotten in his image, which I may compare with the interest on the principal, I will.</div><div class="sentence"> (Audit the account, and do not let me give you a false statement of the debt.)</div><div class="sentence"> You remember our old distinction of the many beautiful and the one beautiful, the particular and the universal, the objects of sight and the objects of thought?</div><div class="sentence"> Did you ever consider that the objects of sight imply a faculty of sight which is the most complex and costly of our senses, requiring not only objects of sense, but also a medium, which is light; without which the sight will not distinguish between colours and all will be a blank?</div><div class="sentence"> 508For light is the noble bond between the perceiving faculty and the thing perceived, and the god who gives us light is the sun, who is the eye of the day, but is not to be confounded with the eye of man.</div><div class="sentence"> This eye of the day or sun is what I call the child of the good, standing in the same relation to the visible world as the good to the intellectual.</div><div class="sentence"> When the sun shines the eye sees, and in the intellectual world where truth is, there is sight and light.</div><div class="sentence"> Now that which is the sun of intelligent natures, is the idea of good, the cause of knowledge and truth, yet other and fairer than they are, 509and standing in the same relation to them in which the sun stands to light.</div><div class="sentence"> O inconceivable height of beauty, which is above knowledge and above truth!</div><div class="sentence"> (‘You cannot surely mean pleasure,’ he said.</div><div class="sentence"> Peace, I replied.)</div><div class="sentence"> And this idea of good, like the sun, is also the cause of growth, and the author not of knowledge only, but of being, yet greater far than either in dignity and power.</div><div class="sentence"> ‘That is a reach of thought more than human; but, pray, go on with the image, for I suspect that there is more behind.’ There is, I said; and bearing in mind our two suns or principles, imagine further their corresponding worlds—one of the visible, the other of the intelligible; you may assist your fancy by figuring the distinction under the image lxxxviii of a line divided into two unequal parts, and may again subdivide each part into two lesser segments representative of the stages of knowledge in either sphere.</div><div class="sentence"> The lower portion of the lower or visible sphere will consist of shadows and reflections, 510and its upper and smaller portion will contain real objects in the world of nature or of art.</div><div class="sentence"> The sphere of the intelligible will also have two divisions,—one of mathematics, in which there is no ascent but all is descent; no inquiring into premises, but only drawing of inferences.</div><div class="sentence"> In this division the mind works with figures and numbers, the images of which are taken not from the shadows, but from the objects, although the truth of them is seen only with the mind’s eye; and they are used as hypotheses without being analysed.</div><div class="sentence"> 511Whereas in the other division reason uses the hypotheses as stages or steps in the ascent to the idea of good, to which she fastens them, and then again descends, walking firmly in the region of ideas, and of ideas only, in her ascent as well as descent, and finally resting in them.</div><div class="sentence"> ‘I partly understand,’ he replied; ‘you mean that the ideas of science are superior to the hypothetical, metaphorical conceptions of geometry and the other arts or sciences, whichever is to be the name of them; and the latter conceptions you refuse to make subjects of pure intellect, because they have no first principle, although when resting on a first principle, they pass into the higher sphere.’ You understand me very well, I said.</div><div class="sentence"> And now to those four divisions of knowledge you may assign four corresponding faculties—pure intelligence to the highest sphere; active intelligence to the second; to the third, faith; to the fourth, the perception of shadows—and the clearness of the several faculties will be in the same ratio as the truth of the objects to which they are related….</div>

and at first they will be able to perceive only shadows and reflections in the water; then they will recognize the moon and the stars, and will at length behold the sun in his own proper place as he is.</div><div class="sentence"> Last of all they will conclude:—This is he who gives us the year and the seasons, and is the author of all that we see.</div><div class="sentence"> How will they rejoice in passing from darkness to light!</div><div class="sentence"> How worthless to them will seem the honours and glories of the den!</div><div class="sentence"> But now imagine further, that they descend into their old habitations;—in that underground dwelling they will not see as well as their fellows, 517and will not be able to compete with them in the measurement of the shadows on the wall; there will be many jokes about the man who went on a visit to the sun and lost his eyes, and if they find anybody trying to set free and enlighten one of their number, they will put him to death, if they can catch him.</div><div class="sentence"> Now the cave or den is the world of sight, the fire is the sun, the way upwards is the way to knowledge, and in the world of knowledge the idea of good is last seen and with difficulty, but when seen is inferred to be the author of good and right—parent of the lord of light in this world, and of truth and understanding in the other.</div><div class="sentence"> c He who attains to the beatific vision is always going upwards; he is unwilling to descend into political assemblies and courts of law; for his eyes are apt to blink at the images or shadows of images which they behold in them—he cannot enter into the ideas of those who have never in their lives understood the relation of the shadow to the substance.</div><div class="sentence"> 518But blindness is of two kinds, and may be caused either by passing out of darkness into light or out of light into darkness, and a man of sense will distinguish between them, and will not laugh equally at both of them, but the blindness which arises from fulness of light he will deem blessed, and pity the other; or if he laugh at the puzzled soul looking at the sun, he will have more reason to laugh than the inhabitants of the den at those who descend from above.</div><div class="sentence"> There is a further lesson taught by this parable of ours.</div><div class="sentence"> Some persons fancy that instruction is like giving eyes to the blind, but we say that the faculty of sight was always there, and that the soul only requires to be turned round towards the light.</div><div class="sentence"> And this is conversion; other virtues are almost like bodily habits, and may be acquired in the same manner, but intelligence has a diviner life, and is indestructible, turning either to good or evil according to the direction given.</div><div class="sentence"> 519Did you never observe how the mind of a clever rogue peers out of his eyes, and the more clearly he sees, the more evil he does?</div><div class="sentence"> Now if you take such an one, and cut away from him those leaden weights of pleasure and desire which bind his soul to earth, his intelligence will be turned round, and he will behold the truth as clearly as he now discerns his meaner ends.</div><div class="sentence"> And have we not decided that our rulers must neither be so uneducated as to have no fixed rule of life, nor so over-educated as to be unwilling to leave their paradise for the business of the world?</div><div class="sentence"> We must choose out therefore the natures who are most likely to ascend to the light and knowledge of the good; but we must not allow them to remain in the region of light; they must be forced down again among the captives in the den to partake of their labours and honours.</div><div class="sentence"> ‘Will they not think this a hardship?’ You should remember that our purpose in framing the State was not that our citizens should do what they like, but that they should serve the State for the common good of all.</div><div class="sentence"> 520May we not fairly say to our philosopher,—Friend, we do you no wrong; for in other ci States philosophy grows wild, and a wild plant owes nothing to the gardener, but you have been trained by us to be the rulers and kings of our hive, and therefore we must insist on your descending into the den.</div><div class="sentence"> You must, each of you, take your turn, and become able to use your eyes in the dark, and with a little practice you will see far better than those who quarrel about the shadows, whose knowledge is a dream only, whilst yours is a waking reality.</div><div class="sentence"> It may be that the saint or philosopher who is best fitted, may also be the least inclined to rule, but necessity is laid upon him, and he must no longer live in the heaven of ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> 521And this will be the salvation of the State.</div><div class="sentence"> For those who rule must not be those who are desirous to rule; and, if you can offer to our citizens a better life than that of rulers generally is, there will be a chance that the rich, not only in this world’s goods, but in virtue and wisdom, may bear rule.</div><div class="sentence"> And the only life which is better than the life of political ambition is that of philosophy, which is also the best preparation for the government of a State.</div>

that is to say, they must be quick at learning, capable of mental toil, retentive, solid, diligent natures, who combine intellectual with moral virtues; not lame and one-sided, diligent in bodily exercise and indolent in mind, or conversely; not a maimed soul, which hates falsehood and yet 536unintentionally is always wallowing in the mire of ignorance; not a bastard or feeble person, but sound in wind and limb, and in perfect condition for the great gymnastic trial of the mind.</div><div class="sentence"> Justice herself can find no fault with natures such as these; and they will be the saviours of our State; disciples of another sort would only make philosophy more ridiculous than she is at present.</div><div class="sentence"> Forgive my enthusiasm; I am becoming excited;

youth is the time of study, and here we must remember that the mind is free and dainty, and, unlike the body, must not be made to work against the grain.</div><div class="sentence"> 537Learning should be at first a sort of play, in which the natural bent cvii is detected.</div><div class="sentence"> As in training them for war, the young dogs should at first only taste blood; but when the necessary gymnastics are over which during two or three years divide life between sleep and bodily exercise, then the education of the soul will become a more serious matter.</div><div class="sentence"> At twenty years of age, a selection must be made of the more promising disciples, with whom a new epoch of education will begin.</div><div class="sentence"> The sciences which they have hitherto learned in fragments will now be brought into relation with each other and with true being; for the power of combining them is the test of speculative and dialectical ability.</div><div class="sentence"> And afterwards at thirty a further selection shall be made of those who are able to withdraw from the world of sense into the abstraction of ideas.</div><div class="sentence"> But at this point, judging from present experience, there is a danger that dialectic may be the source of many evils.</div><div class="sentence"> The danger may be illustrated by a parallel case:—Imagine a person who has been brought up in wealth and luxury amid a crowd of flatterers, and who is suddenly informed that he is a supposititious son.</div><div class="sentence"> 538He has hitherto honoured his reputed parents and disregarded the flatterers, and now he does the reverse.</div><div class="sentence"> This is just what happens with a man’s principles.</div><div class="sentence"> There are certain doctrines which he learnt at home and which exercised a parental authority over him.</div><div class="sentence"> Presently he finds that imputations are cast upon them; a troublesome querist comes and asks, ‘What is the just and good?’ or proves that virtue is vice and vice virtue, and his mind becomes unsettled, and he ceases to love, honour, and obey them as he has hitherto done.</div><div class="sentence"> 539He is seduced into the life of pleasure, and becomes a lawless person and a rogue.</div><div class="sentence"> The case of such speculators is very pitiable, and, in order that our thirty years’ old pupils may not require this pity, let us take every possible care that young persons do not study philosophy too early.</div><div class="sentence"> For a young man is a sort of puppy who only plays with an argument; and is reasoned into and out of his opinions every day; he soon begins to believe nothing, and brings himself and philosophy into discredit.</div><div class="sentence"> A man of thirty does not run on in this way; he will argue and not merely contradict, and adds new honour to philosophy by the sobriety of his conduct.</div><div class="sentence"> What time shall we allow for this second gymnastic training of the soul?—say, twice the time required for the gymnastics of the body; six, or perhaps five years, to commence at thirty, and then for fifteen cviii years let the student go down into the den, and command armies, and gain experience of life.</div><div class="sentence"> 540At fifty let him return to the end of all things, and have his eyes uplifted to the idea of good, and order his life after that pattern; if necessary, taking his turn at the helm of State, and training up others to be his successors.</div><div class="sentence"> When his time comes he shall depart in peace to the islands of the blest.</div><div class="sentence"> He shall be honoured with sacrifices, and receive such worship as the Pythian oracle approves.</div>

                        <div class="sentence"> There seem to be two great aims in the philosophy of Plato,—first, to realize abstractions; secondly, to connect them.</div><div class="sentence"> According to him, the true education is that which draws men from becoming to being, and to a comprehensive survey of all being.</div><div class="sentence"> He desires to develop in the human mind the faculty of seeing the universal in all things; until at last the particulars of sense drop away and the universal alone remains.</div><div class="sentence"> He then seeks to combine the universals which he has disengaged from sense, not perceiving that the correlation of them has no other basis but the common use of language.</div><div class="sentence"> He never understands that abstractions, as Hegel says, are ‘mere abstractions’—of use when employed in the arrangement of facts, but adding nothing to the sum of knowledge when pursued apart from them, or with reference to an imaginary idea of good.</div><div class="sentence"> Still the exercise of the faculty of abstraction apart from facts has enlarged the mind, and played a great part in the education of the human race.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato appreciated the value of this faculty, and saw that it might be quickened by the study of number and relation.</div><div class="sentence"> All things in which there is opposition or proportion are suggestive of reflection.</div><div class="sentence"> The mere impression of sense evokes no power of thought or of mind, but when sensible objects ask to be compared and distinguished, then philosophy begins.</div><div class="sentence"> The science of arithmetic first suggests such distinctions.</div><div class="sentence"> There follow in order the other sciences of plain and solid geometry, and of solids in motion, one branch of which is astronomy or the harmony of the spheres,—to this is appended the sister science of the harmony of sounds.</div><div class="sentence"> Plato seems also to hint at the possibility of other applications of arithmetical or mathematical proportions, such as we employ in chemistry and natural philosophy, such as the Pythagoreans and even Aristotle make use of in Ethics cx and Politics, e.g.</div><div class="sentence"> his distinction between arithmetical and geometrical proportion in the Ethics (Book V), or between numerical and proportional equality in the Politics (iii.</div><div class="sentence"> 8, iv.</div><div class="sentence"> 12, &c.).</div>

the one from excess of wealth, the other from excess of freedom.</div><div class="sentence"> ‘The great natural good of life,’ says the democrat, ‘is freedom.’ And this exclusive love of freedom and regardlessness of everything else, is the cause of the change from democracy to tyranny.</div><div class="sentence"> The State demands the strong wine of freedom, and unless her rulers give her a plentiful draught, punishes and insults them; equality and fraternity of governors and governed is the approved principle.</div><div class="sentence"> Anarchy is the law, not of the State only, but of private houses, and extends even to the animals.</div><div class="sentence"> 563Father and son, citizen and foreigner, teacher and pupil, old and young, are all on a level; fathers and teachers fear their sons and pupils, and the wisdom of the young man is a match for the elder, and the old imitate the jaunty manners of the young because they are afraid of being thought morose.</div><div class="sentence"> Slaves are on a level with their masters and mistresses, and there is no difference between men and women.</div><div class="sentence"> Nay, the very animals in a democratic State have a freedom which is unknown in other places.</div><div class="sentence"> The she-dogs are as good as their she-mistresses, and horses and asses march along with dignity and run their noses against anybody who comes in their way.</div><div class="sentence"> ‘That has often been my experience.’ At last the citizens become so sensitive that they cannot endure the yoke of laws, written or unwritten; they would have no man call himself their master.</div><div class="sentence"> Such is the glorious beginning of things out of which tyranny springs.</div><div class="sentence"> ‘Glorious, indeed; but what is to follow?’ The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; 564for there is a law of contraries; the excess of freedom passes into the excess of slavery, and the greater the freedom the greater the slavery.</div><div class="sentence"> You will remember that in the oligarchy were found two classes—rogues and paupers, whom we compared to drones with and without stings.</div><div class="sentence"> These two classes are to the State what phlegm and bile are to the human body; and the State-physician, or legislator, must get rid of them, just as the bee-master keeps the drones out of the hive.</div><div class="sentence"> Now in a democracy, too, there are drones, but they are more numerous and more dangerous than in the oligarchy; there they are inert and unpractised, here they are full of life and animation; and the keener sort speak and act, while the others buzz about the bema and prevent their opponents from being heard.</div><div class="sentence"> And there is another class in democratic States, cxxiv of respectable, thriving individuals, who can be squeezed when the drones have need of their possessions; 565there is moreover a third class, who are the labourers and the artisans, and they make up the mass of the people.</div><div class="sentence"> When the people meet, they are omnipotent, but they cannot be brought together unless they are attracted by a little honey; and the rich are made to supply the honey, of which the demagogues keep the greater part themselves, giving a taste only to the mob.</div><div class="sentence"> Their victims attempt to resist; they are driven mad by the stings of the drones, and so become downright oligarchs in self-defence.</div><div class="sentence"> Then follow informations and convictions for treason.</div><div class="sentence"> The people have some protector whom they nurse into greatness, and from this root the tree of tyranny springs.</div><div class="sentence"> The nature of the change is indicated in the old fable of the temple of Zeus Lycaeus, which tells how he who tastes human flesh mixed up with the flesh of other victims will turn into a wolf.</div><div class="sentence"> Even so the protector, who tastes human blood, and slays some and exiles others with or without law, who hints at abolition of debts and division of lands, 566must either perish or become a wolf—that is, a tyrant.</div><div class="sentence"> Perhaps he is driven out, but he soon comes back from exile; and then if his enemies cannot get rid of him by lawful means, they plot his assassination.</div><div class="sentence"> Thereupon the friend of the people makes his well-known request to them for a body-guard, which they readily grant, thinking only of his danger and not of their own.</div><div class="sentence"> Now let the rich man make to himself wings, for he will never run away again if he does not do so then.</div><div class="sentence"> And the Great Protector, having crushed all his rivals, stands proudly erect in the chariot of State, a full-blown tyrant: Let us enquire into the nature of his happiness.</div>

                        <div class="speaker">I. Plato expressly says that he is intending to found an Hellenic State (Book v. 470 E). Many of his regulations are characteristically Spartan; such as the prohibition of gold and silver, the common meals of the men, the military training of the youth, the gymnastic exercises of the women. The life of Sparta was the life of a camp (Laws ii. 666 E), enforced even more rigidly in time of peace than in war; the citizens of Sparta, like Plato’s, were forbidden to trade—they were to be soldiers and not shopkeepers. Nowhere else in Greece was the individual so completely subjected to the State; the time when he was to marry, the education of his children, the clothes which he was to wear, the food which he was to eat, were all prescribed by law. Some of the best enactments in the Republic, such as the reverence to be paid to parents and elders, and some of the worst, such as the exposure of deformed children, are borrowed from the practice of Sparta. The encouragement of friendships between men and youths, or of men with one another, as affording incentives to bravery, is also Spartan; in Sparta too a nearer approach was made than in any other Greek State to equality of the sexes, and to community of property; and while there was probably less of licentiousness in the sense of immorality, the tie of marriage was regarded more lightly than in the rest of Greece. The ‘suprema lex’ was the preservation of the family, and the interest of the State. The coarse strength of a military government was not favourable to purity and refinement; and the excessive strictness of some regulations seems to have produced a reaction. Of all Hellenes the Spartans were most accessible to bribery; several of the greatest of them might be described in the words of Plato as having a ‘fierce secret longing after gold and silver.’ Though not in the strict sense communists, the principle of communism was maintained among them in their division of lands, in their common meals, in their slaves, and in the free use of one another’s goods. Marriage was a public institution</div>

The paradoxes of one age have been said to become the commonplaces of the next; but the paradoxes of Plato are at least as paradoxical to us as they were to his contemporaries. The clxxv modern world has either sneered at them as absurd, or denounced them as unnatural and immoral; men have been pleased to find in Aristotle’s criticisms of them the anticipation of their own good sense. The wealthy and cultivated classes have disliked and also dreaded them; they have pointed with satisfaction to the failure of efforts to realize them in practice. Yet since they are the thoughts of one of the greatest of human intelligences, and of one who had done most to elevate morality and religion, they seem to deserve a better treatment at our hands. We may have to address the public, as Plato does poetry, and assure them that we mean no harm to existing institutions.

Plato’s views of education are in several respects remarkable; like the rest of the Republic they are partly Greek and partly ideal, beginning with the ordinary curriculum of the Greek youth, and extending to after-life. Plato is the first writer who distinctly says that education is to comprehend the whole of life, and to be a preparation for another in which education begins again (vi. 498 D).

                        <div class="speaker">IV. We remark with surprise that the progress of nations or ccxii the natural growth of institutions which fill modern treatises on political philosophy seem hardly ever to have attracted the attention of Plato and Aristotle. The ancients were familiar with the mutability of human affairs; they could moralize over the ruins of cities and the fall of empires (cp. Plato, Statesman 301, 302, and Sulpicius’ Letter to Cicero, Ad Fam. iv. 5); by them fate and chance were deemed to be real powers, almost persons, and to have had a great share in political events. The wiser of them like Thucydides believed that ‘what had been would be again,’ and that a tolerable idea of the future could be gathered from the past. Also they had dreams of a Golden Age which existed once upon a time and might still exist in some unknown land, or might return again in the remote future. But the regular growth of a state enlightened by experience, progressing in knowledge, improving in the arts, of which the citizens were educated by the fulfilment of political duties, appears never to have come within the range of their hopes and aspirations. Such a state had never been seen, and therefore could not be conceived by them. Their experience (cp. Aristot. Metaph. xi. 21; Plato, Laws iii. 676–9) led them to conclude that there had been cycles of civilization in which the arts had been discovered and lost many times over, and cities had been overthrown and rebuilt again and again, and deluges and volcanoes and other natural convulsions had altered the face of the earth. Tradition told them of many destructions of mankind and of the preservation of a remnant. The world began again after a deluge and was reconstructed out of the fragments of itself. Also they were acquainted with empires of unknown antiquity, like the Egyptian or Assyrian; but they had never seen them grow, and could not imagine, any more than we can, the state of man which preceded them. They were puzzled and awestricken by the Egyptian monuments, of which the forms, as Plato says, not in a figure, but literally, were ten thousand years old (Laws ii. 656 E), and they contrasted the antiquity of Egypt with their own short memories.</div>

                        <div class="speaker">VII. Human life and conduct are affected by ideals in the same way that they are affected by the examples of eminent men. Neither the one nor the other are immediately applicable to practice, but there is a virtue flowing from them which tends to raise individuals above the common routine of society or trade, and to elevate States above the mere interests of commerce or the necessities of self-defence. Like the ideals of art they are partly framed by the omission of particulars; they require to be viewed at a certain distance, and are apt to fade away if we attempt to approach them. They gain an imaginary distinctness when embodied in a State or in a system of philosophy, but they still remain the visions of ‘a world unrealized.’ More striking and obvious to the ordinary mind are the examples of great men, who have served their own generation and are remembered in another. Even in our own family circle there may have been some one, a woman, or even a child, in whose face has shone forth a goodness more than human. The ideal then approaches nearer to us, and we fondly cling to it. The ideal of the past, whether of our own past lives or of former states of society, has a singular fascination for the minds of many. Too late we learn that such ideals cannot be recalled, though the recollection of them may have a humanizing influence on other times. But the abstractions of philosophy are to most persons cold and vacant; they give light without warmth; they are like the full moon in the heavens when there are no stars appearing. Men cannot live by thought alone; the world of sense is always breaking in upon them. They are for the most part confined to a corner of earth, and see but a little way beyond their own home or place of abode; they ‘do not lift up their eyes to the hills’; they are not awake when the dawn appears. But in Plato we have reached a height from which a man may look into the distance (Rep. iv. 445 C) and behold the future of the world and of philosophy. The ideal of the State and of the life of the philosopher; the ideal of an education ccxxx continuing through life and extending equally to both sexes; the ideal of the unity and correlation of knowledge; the faith in good and immortality—are the vacant forms of light on which Plato is seeking to fix the eye of mankind.</div>

Well, I said, I will tell you a tale; not one of the tales which Odysseus tells to the hero Alcinous, yet this too is a tale of a hero, Er the son of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth. He was slain in battle, and ten days afterwards, when the bodies of the dead were taken up already in a state of corruption, his body was found unaffected by decay, and 331 carried away home to be buried. And on the twelfth day, as he was lying on the funeral pile, he returned to life and told them what he had seen in the other world. The judgement.He said that when his soul left the body he went on a journey with a great company, Cand that they came to a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth; they were near together, and over against them were two other openings in the heaven above. The two openings in heaven and the two in earth through which passed those who were beginning and those who had completed their pilgrimage.In the intermediate space there were judges seated, who commanded the just, after they had given judgment on them and had bound their sentences in front of them, to ascend by the heavenly way on the right hand; and in like manner the unjust were bidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left hand; these also bore the symbols of their deeds, but fastened on their backs. He drew near, Dand they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry the report of the other world to men, and they bade him hear and see all that was to be heard and seen in that place. Then he beheld and saw on one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and earth when sentence had been given on them; and at the two other openings other souls, some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn with travel, some descending out of heaven clean and bright. And Earriving ever and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey, and they went forth with gladness into the meadow, where they encamped as at a festival; and those who knew one another embraced and conversed, the souls which came from earth curiously enquiring about the things above, The meeting in the meadow.and the souls which came from heaven about the things beneath. And they told one another of what had happened by the way, those from below weeping and sorrowing 615at the remembrance of the things which they had endured and seen in their journey beneath the earth (now the journey lasted a thousand years), while those from above were describing heavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty. The story, Glaucon, would take too long to tell; but the sum was this</div>

Art).</div><div class="sentence"> The restless energy of the Athenian character is perhaps reflected in the discipline imposed upon the ruling class (7.</div><div class="sentence"> 540), who when they have reached fifty are dispensed from continuous public service, but must then devote themselves to abstract study, and also be willing to take their turn when necessary at the helm of state [cp.</div><div class="sentence"> Laws 7.</div><div class="sentence"> 807; Thucyd.</div><div class="sentence"> i.</div><div class="sentence"> 70; ii.</div><div class="sentence"> 40].—II.</div><div class="sentence"> The most peculiar features of Plato’s state are (1) the community of property, (2) the position of women, (3) the government of philosophers.</div><div class="sentence"> (1) The first (see s. v.), though suggested in some measure by the example of Sparta or Crete [cp.</div><div class="sentence"> Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Pol.</div><div class="sentence"> ii.</div><div class="sentence"> 5, § 6], is not known to have been actually practised anywhere in Hellas, unless possibly among such a body as the Pythagorean brotherhood.</div><div class="sentence"> (2) Nothing in all the Republic was probably stranger to his contemporaries than the place which Plato assigns to women in the state.</div><div class="sentence"> The community of wives and children, though carefully guarded by him from the charge of licentiousness (5.</div><div class="sentence"> 458 E), would appear worse in Athenian eyes than the traditional ‘licence’ of the Spartan women [Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Pol.</div><div class="sentence"> ii.</div><div class="sentence"> 9, § 5), which, so far as it really existed, no doubt arose out of an excessive regard to physical considerations in marriage.</div><div class="sentence"> Again, the equal share in education, in war, and in administration which the women are supposed to enjoy in Plato’s state, was, if not so revolting, quite as contrary to common Hellenic sentiment [cp.</div><div class="sentence"> Thucyd.</div><div class="sentence"> ii.</div><div class="sentence"> 45].</div><div class="sentence"> The Spartan women exercised a great influence on public affairs, but this was mainly indirect [cp.</div><div class="sentence"> Laws 7.</div><div class="sentence"> 806; Arist.</div><div class="sentence"> Pol.</div><div class="sentence"> ii.</div><div class="sentence"> 9, § 8]; they did not hold office or learn the use of arms.</div><div class="sentence"> At Athens, as is well known, the women, of the upper classes at least, lived in an almost Oriental seclusion, and were wholly absorbed in household duties (Laws 7.</div><div class="sentence"> 805 E).</div><div class="sentence"> (3) Finally, the government of philosophers had no analogy in the Hellenic world of 375 Plato’s time.</div><div class="sentence"> He may have taken the suggestion from the stories of the Pythagorean rule in Magna Graecia.</div><div class="sentence"> But it is also possible that these accounts of the brotherhood of Pythagoras, some of which have reached us on very doubtful authority, may be themselves to a considerable extent coloured and distorted by features adapted from the Republic.</div><div class="sentence"> Whether this is the case or not, we can hardly doubt that Plato was chiefly indebted to his own imagination for his kingdom of philosophers, or that it remained to himself an ideal, rather than a state which would ever ‘play her part in actual life’ (Tim.</div><div class="sentence"> 19, 20).</div><div class="sentence"> It is at least significant that he never finished the Critias, as though he were unable to embody, even in a mythical form, the ‘city of which the pattern is laid up in heaven.’]</div>
