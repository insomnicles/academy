<h2>
      INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
<p>
      The Euthydemus, though apt to be regarded by us only as an elaborate jest,
      has also a very serious purpose. It may fairly claim to be the oldest
      treatise on logic; for that science originates in the misunderstandings
      which necessarily accompany the first efforts of speculation. Several of
      the fallacies which are satirized in it reappear in the Sophistici Elenchi
      of Aristotle and are retained at the end of our manuals of logic. But if
      the order of history were followed, they should be placed not at the end
      but at the beginning of them; for they belong to the age in which the
      human mind was first making the attempt to distinguish thought from sense,
      and to separate the universal from the particular or individual. How to
      put together words or ideas, how to escape ambiguities in the meaning of
      terms or in the structure of propositions, how to resist the fixed
      impression of an 'eternal being' or 'perpetual flux,' how to distinguish
      between words and things—these were problems not easy of solution in
      the infancy of philosophy. They presented the same kind of difficulty to
      the half-educated man which spelling or arithmetic do to the mind of a
      child. It was long before the new world of ideas which had been sought
      after with such passionate yearning was set in order and made ready for
      use. To us the fallacies which arise in the pre-Socratic philosophy are
      trivial and obsolete because we are no longer liable to fall into the
      errors which are expressed by them. The intellectual world has become
      better assured to us, and we are less likely to be imposed upon by
      illusions of words.
    </p>
<p>
      The logic of Aristotle is for the most part latent in the dialogues of
      Plato. The nature of definition is explained not by rules but by examples
      in the Charmides, Lysis, Laches, Protagoras, Meno, Euthyphro, Theaetetus,
      Gorgias, Republic; the nature of division is likewise illustrated by
      examples in the Sophist and Statesman; a scheme of categories is found in
      the Philebus; the true doctrine of contradiction is taught, and the
      fallacy of arguing in a circle is exposed in the Republic; the nature of
      synthesis and analysis is graphically described in the Phaedrus; the
      nature of words is analysed in the Cratylus; the form of the syllogism is
      indicated in the genealogical trees of the Sophist and Statesman; a true
      doctrine of predication and an analysis of the sentence are given in the
      Sophist; the different meanings of one and being are worked out in the
      Parmenides. Here we have most of the important elements of logic, not yet
      systematized or reduced to an art or science, but scattered up and down as
      they would naturally occur in ordinary discourse. They are of little or no
      use or significance to us; but because we have grown out of the need of
      them we should not therefore despise them. They are still interesting and
      instructive for the light which they shed on the history of the human
      mind.
    </p>
<p>
      There are indeed many old fallacies which linger among us, and new ones
      are constantly springing up. But they are not of the kind to which ancient
      logic can be usefully applied. The weapons of common sense, not the
      analytics of Aristotle, are needed for their overthrow. Nor is the use of
      the Aristotelian logic any longer natural to us. We no longer put
      arguments into the form of syllogisms like the schoolmen; the simple use
      of language has been, happily, restored to us. Neither do we discuss the
      nature of the proposition, nor extract hidden truths from the copula, nor
      dispute any longer about nominalism and realism. We do not confuse the
      form with the matter of knowledge, or invent laws of thought, or imagine
      that any single science furnishes a principle of reasoning to all the
      rest. Neither do we require categories or heads of argument to be invented
      for our use. Those who have no knowledge of logic, like some of our great
      physical philosophers, seem to be quite as good reasoners as those who
      have. Most of the ancient puzzles have been settled on the basis of usage
      and common sense; there is no need to reopen them. No science should raise
      problems or invent forms of thought which add nothing to knowledge and are
      of no use in assisting the acquisition of it. This seems to be the natural
      limit of logic and metaphysics; if they give us a more comprehensive or a
      more definite view of the different spheres of knowledge they are to be
      studied; if not, not. The better part of ancient logic appears hardly in
      our own day to have a separate existence; it is absorbed in two other
      sciences: (1) rhetoric, if indeed this ancient art be not also fading away
      into literary criticism; (2) the science of language, under which all
      questions relating to words and propositions and the combinations of them
      may properly be included.
    </p>
<p>
      To continue dead or imaginary sciences, which make no signs of progress
      and have no definite sphere, tends to interfere with the prosecution of
      living ones. The study of them is apt to blind the judgment and to render
      men incapable of seeing the value of evidence, and even of appreciating
      the nature of truth. Nor should we allow the living science to become
      confused with the dead by an ambiguity of language. The term logic has two
      different meanings, an ancient and a modern one, and we vainly try to
      bridge the gulf between them. Many perplexities are avoided by keeping
      them apart. There might certainly be a new science of logic; it would not
      however be built up out of the fragments of the old, but would be distinct
      from them—relative to the state of knowledge which exists at the
      present time, and based chiefly on the methods of Modern Inductive
      philosophy. Such a science might have two legitimate fields: first, the
      refutation and explanation of false philosophies still hovering in the air
      as they appear from the point of view of later experience or are
      comprehended in the history of the human mind, as in a larger horizon:
      secondly, it might furnish new forms of thought more adequate to the
      expression of all the diversities and oppositions of knowledge which have
      grown up in these latter days; it might also suggest new methods of
      enquiry derived from the comparison of the sciences. Few will deny that
      the introduction of the words 'subject' and 'object' and the Hegelian
      reconciliation of opposites have been 'most gracious aids' to psychology,
      or that the methods of Bacon and Mill have shed a light far and wide on
      the realms of knowledge. These two great studies, the one destructive and
      corrective of error, the other conservative and constructive of truth,
      might be a first and second part of logic. Ancient logic would be the
      propaedeutic or gate of approach to logical science,—nothing more.
      But to pursue such speculations further, though not irrelevant, might lead
      us too far away from the argument of the dialogue.
    </p>
<p>
      The Euthydemus is, of all the Dialogues of Plato, that in which he
      approaches most nearly to the comic poet. The mirth is broader, the irony
      more sustained, the contrast between Socrates and the two Sophists,
      although veiled, penetrates deeper than in any other of his writings. Even
      Thrasymachus, in the Republic, is at last pacified, and becomes a friendly
      and interested auditor of the great discourse. But in the Euthydemus the
      mask is never dropped; the accustomed irony of Socrates continues to the
      end...
    </p>
<p>
      Socrates narrates to Crito a remarkable scene in which he has himself
      taken part, and in which the two brothers, Dionysodorus and Euthydemus,
      are the chief performers. They are natives of Chios, who had settled at
      Thurii, but were driven out, and in former days had been known at Athens
      as professors of rhetoric and of the art of fighting in armour. To this
      they have now added a new accomplishment—the art of Eristic, or
      fighting with words, which they are likewise willing to teach 'for a
      consideration.' But they can also teach virtue in a very short time and in
      the very best manner. Socrates, who is always on the look-out for teachers
      of virtue, is interested in the youth Cleinias, the grandson of the great
      Alcibiades, and is desirous that he should have the benefit of their
      instructions. He is ready to fall down and worship them; although the
      greatness of their professions does arouse in his mind a temporary
      incredulity.
    </p>
<p>
      A circle gathers round them, in the midst of which are Socrates, the two
      brothers, the youth Cleinias, who is watched by the eager eyes of his
      lover Ctesippus, and others. The performance begins; and such a
      performance as might well seem to require an invocation of Memory and the
      Muses. It is agreed that the brothers shall question Cleinias. 'Cleinias,'
      says Euthydemus, 'who learn, the wise or the unwise?' 'The wise,' is the
      reply; given with blushing and hesitation. 'And yet when you learned you
      did not know and were not wise.' Then Dionysodorus takes up the ball: 'Who
      are they who learn dictation of the grammar-master; the wise or the
      foolish boys?' 'The wise.' 'Then, after all, the wise learn.' 'And do they
      learn,' said Euthydemus, 'what they know or what they do not know?' 'The
      latter.' 'And dictation is a dictation of letters?' 'Yes.' 'And you know
      letters?' 'Yes.' 'Then you learn what you know.' 'But,' retorts
      Dionysodorus, 'is not learning acquiring knowledge?' 'Yes.' 'And you
      acquire that which you have not got already?' 'Yes.' 'Then you learn that
      which you do not know.'
    </p>
<p>
      Socrates is afraid that the youth Cleinias may be discouraged at these
      repeated overthrows. He therefore explains to him the nature of the
      process to which he is being subjected. The two strangers are not serious;
      there are jests at the mysteries which precede the enthronement, and he is
      being initiated into the mysteries of the sophistical ritual. This is all
      a sort of horse-play, which is now ended. The exhortation to virtue will
      follow, and Socrates himself (if the wise men will not laugh at him) is
      desirous of showing the way in which such an exhortation should be carried
      on, according to his own poor notion. He proceeds to question Cleinias.
      The result of the investigation may be summed up as follows:—
    </p>
<p>
      All men desire good; and good means the possession of goods, such as
      wealth, health, beauty, birth, power, honour; not forgetting the virtues
      and wisdom. And yet in this enumeration the greatest good of all is
      omitted. What is that? Good fortune. But what need is there of good
      fortune when we have wisdom already:—in every art and business are
      not the wise also the fortunate? This is admitted. And again, the
      possession of goods is not enough; there must also be a right use of them
      which can only be given by knowledge: in themselves they are neither good
      nor evil—knowledge and wisdom are the only good, and ignorance and
      folly the only evil. The conclusion is that we must get 'wisdom.' But can
      wisdom be taught? 'Yes,' says Cleinias. The ingenuousness of the youth
      delights Socrates, who is at once relieved from the necessity of
      discussing one of his great puzzles. 'Since wisdom is the only good, he
      must become a philosopher, or lover of wisdom.' 'That I will,' says
      Cleinias.
    </p>
<p>
      After Socrates has given this specimen of his own mode of instruction, the
      two brothers recommence their exhortation to virtue, which is of quite
      another sort.
    </p>
<p>
      'You want Cleinias to be wise?' 'Yes.' 'And he is not wise yet?' 'No.'
      'Then you want him to be what he is not, and not to be what he is?—not
      to be—that is, to perish. Pretty lovers and friends you must all
      be!'
    </p>
<p>
      Here Ctesippus, the lover of Cleinias, interposes in great excitement,
      thinking that he will teach the two Sophists a lesson of good manners. But
      he is quickly entangled in the meshes of their sophistry; and as a storm
      seems to be gathering Socrates pacifies him with a joke, and Ctesippus
      then says that he is not reviling the two Sophists, he is only
      contradicting them. 'But,' says Dionysodorus, 'there is no such thing as
      contradiction. When you and I describe the same thing, or you describe one
      thing and I describe another, how can there be a contradiction?' Ctesippus
      is unable to reply.
    </p>
<p>
      Socrates has already heard of the denial of contradiction, and would like
      to be informed by the great master of the art, 'What is the meaning of
      this paradox? Is there no such thing as error, ignorance, falsehood? Then
      what are they professing to teach?' The two Sophists complain that
      Socrates is ready to answer what they said a year ago, but is
      'non-plussed' at what they are saying now. 'What does the word
      "non-plussed" mean?' Socrates is informed, in reply, that words are
      lifeless things, and lifeless things have no sense or meaning. Ctesippus
      again breaks out, and again has to be pacified by Socrates, who renews the
      conversation with Cleinias. The two Sophists are like Proteus in the
      variety of their transformations, and he, like Menelaus in the Odyssey,
      hopes to restore them to their natural form.
    </p>
<p>
      He had arrived at the conclusion that Cleinias must become a philosopher.
      And philosophy is the possession of knowledge; and knowledge must be of a
      kind which is profitable and may be used. What knowledge is there which
      has such a nature? Not the knowledge which is required in any particular
      art; nor again the art of the composer of speeches, who knows how to write
      them, but cannot speak them, although he too must be admitted to be a kind
      of enchanter of wild animals. Neither is the knowledge which we are
      seeking the knowledge of the general. For the general makes over his prey
      to the statesman, as the huntsman does to the cook, or the taker of quails
      to the keeper of quails; he has not the use of that which he acquires. The
      two enquirers, Cleinias and Socrates, are described as wandering about in
      a wilderness, vainly searching after the art of life and happiness. At
      last they fix upon the kingly art, as having the desired sort of
      knowledge. But the kingly art only gives men those goods which are neither
      good nor evil: and if we say further that it makes us wise, in what does
      it make us wise? Not in special arts, such as cobbling or carpentering,
      but only in itself: or say again that it makes us good, there is no answer
      to the question, 'good in what?' At length in despair Cleinias and
      Socrates turn to the 'Dioscuri' and request their aid.
    </p>
<p>
      Euthydemus argues that Socrates knows something; and as he cannot know and
      not know, he cannot know some things and not know others, and therefore he
      knows all things: he and Dionysodorus and all other men know all things.
      'Do they know shoemaking, etc?' 'Yes.' The sceptical Ctesippus would like
      to have some evidence of this extraordinary statement: he will believe if
      Euthydemus will tell him how many teeth Dionysodorus has, and if
      Dionysodorus will give him a like piece of information about Euthydemus.
      Even Socrates is incredulous, and indulges in a little raillery at the
      expense of the brothers. But he restrains himself, remembering that if the
      men who are to be his teachers think him stupid they will take no pains
      with him. Another fallacy is produced which turns on the absoluteness of
      the verb 'to know.' And here Dionysodorus is caught 'napping,' and is
      induced by Socrates to confess that 'he does not know the good to be
      unjust.' Socrates appeals to his brother Euthydemus; at the same time he
      acknowledges that he cannot, like Heracles, fight against a Hydra, and
      even Heracles, on the approach of a second monster, called upon his nephew
      Iolaus to help. Dionysodorus rejoins that Iolaus was no more the nephew of
      Heracles than of Socrates. For a nephew is a nephew, and a brother is a
      brother, and a father is a father, not of one man only, but of all; nor of
      men only, but of dogs and sea-monsters. Ctesippus makes merry with the
      consequences which follow: 'Much good has your father got out of the
      wisdom of his puppies.'
    </p>
<p>
      'But,' says Euthydemus, unabashed, 'nobody wants much good.' Medicine is a
      good, arms are a good, money is a good, and yet there may be too much of
      them in wrong places. 'No,' says Ctesippus, 'there cannot be too much
      gold.' And would you be happy if you had three talents of gold in your
      belly, a talent in your pate, and a stater in either eye?' Ctesippus,
      imitating the new wisdom, replies, 'And do not the Scythians reckon those
      to be the happiest of men who have their skulls gilded and see the inside
      of them?' 'Do you see,' retorts Euthydemus, 'what has the quality of
      vision or what has not the quality of vision?' 'What has the quality of
      vision.' 'And you see our garments?' 'Yes.' 'Then our garments have the
      quality of vision.' A similar play of words follows, which is successfully
      retorted by Ctesippus, to the great delight of Cleinias, who is rebuked by
      Socrates for laughing at such solemn and beautiful things.
    </p>
<p>
      'But are there any beautiful things? And if there are such, are they the
      same or not the same as absolute beauty?' Socrates replies that they are
      not the same, but each of them has some beauty present with it. 'And are
      you an ox because you have an ox present with you?' After a few more
      amphiboliae, in which Socrates, like Ctesippus, in self-defence borrows
      the weapons of the brothers, they both confess that the two heroes are
      invincible; and the scene concludes with a grand chorus of shouting and
      laughing, and a panegyrical oration from Socrates:—
    </p>
<p>
      First, he praises the indifference of Dionysodorus and Euthydemus to
      public opinion; for most persons would rather be refuted by such arguments
      than use them in the refutation of others. Secondly, he remarks upon their
      impartiality; for they stop their own mouths, as well as those of other
      people. Thirdly, he notes their liberality, which makes them give away
      their secret to all the world: they should be more reserved, and let no
      one be present at this exhibition who does not pay them a handsome fee; or
      better still they might practise on one another only. He concludes with a
      respectful request that they will receive him and Cleinias among their
      disciples.
    </p>
<p>
      Crito tells Socrates that he has heard one of the audience criticise
      severely this wisdom,—not sparing Socrates himself for countenancing
      such an exhibition. Socrates asks what manner of man was this censorious
      critic. 'Not an orator, but a great composer of speeches.' Socrates
      understands that he is an amphibious animal, half philosopher, half
      politician; one of a class who have the highest opinion of themselves and
      a spite against philosophers, whom they imagine to be their rivals. They
      are a class who are very likely to get mauled by Euthydemus and his
      friends, and have a great notion of their own wisdom; for they imagine
      themselves to have all the advantages and none of the drawbacks both of
      politics and of philosophy. They do not understand the principles of
      combination, and hence are ignorant that the union of two good things
      which have different ends produces a compound inferior to either of them
      taken separately.
    </p>
<p>
      Crito is anxious about the education of his children, one of whom is
      growing up. The description of Dionysodorus and Euthydemus suggests to him
      the reflection that the professors of education are strange beings.
      Socrates consoles him with the remark that the good in all professions are
      few, and recommends that 'he and his house' should continue to serve
      philosophy, and not mind about its professors.
    </p>
<p>
      ...
    </p>
<p>
      There is a stage in the history of philosophy in which the old is dying
      out, and the new has not yet come into full life. Great philosophies like
      the Eleatic or Heraclitean, which have enlarged the boundaries of the
      human mind, begin to pass away in words. They subsist only as forms which
      have rooted themselves in language—as troublesome elements of
      thought which cannot be either used or explained away. The same
      absoluteness which was once attributed to abstractions is now attached to
      the words which are the signs of them. The philosophy which in the first
      and second generation was a great and inspiring effort of reflection, in
      the third becomes sophistical, verbal, eristic.
    </p>
<p>
      It is this stage of philosophy which Plato satirises in the Euthydemus.
      The fallacies which are noted by him appear trifling to us now, but they
      were not trifling in the age before logic, in the decline of the earlier
      Greek philosophies, at a time when language was first beginning to perplex
      human thought. Besides he is caricaturing them; they probably received
      more subtle forms at the hands of those who seriously maintained them.
      They are patent to us in Plato, and we are inclined to wonder how any one
      could ever have been deceived by them; but we must remember also that
      there was a time when the human mind was only with great difficulty
      disentangled from such fallacies.
    </p>
<p>
      To appreciate fully the drift of the Euthydemus, we should imagine a
      mental state in which not individuals only, but whole schools during more
      than one generation, were animated by the desire to exclude the conception
      of rest, and therefore the very word 'this' (Theaet.) from language; in
      which the ideas of space, time, matter, motion, were proved to be
      contradictory and imaginary; in which the nature of qualitative change was
      a puzzle, and even differences of degree, when applied to abstract
      notions, were not understood; in which there was no analysis of grammar,
      and mere puns or plays of words received serious attention; in which
      contradiction itself was denied, and, on the one hand, every predicate was
      affirmed to be true of every subject, and on the other, it was held that
      no predicate was true of any subject, and that nothing was, or was known,
      or could be spoken. Let us imagine disputes carried on with religious
      earnestness and more than scholastic subtlety, in which the catchwords of
      philosophy are completely detached from their context. (Compare Theaet.)
      To such disputes the humour, whether of Plato in the ancient, or of Pope
      and Swift in the modern world, is the natural enemy. Nor must we forget
      that in modern times also there is no fallacy so gross, no trick of
      language so transparent, no abstraction so barren and unmeaning, no form
      of thought so contradictory to experience, which has not been found to
      satisfy the minds of philosophical enquirers at a certain stage, or when
      regarded from a certain point of view only. The peculiarity of the
      fallacies of our own age is that we live within them, and are therefore
      generally unconscious of them.
    </p>
<p>
      Aristotle has analysed several of the same fallacies in his book 'De
      Sophisticis Elenchis,' which Plato, with equal command of their true
      nature, has preferred to bring to the test of ridicule. At first we are
      only struck with the broad humour of this 'reductio ad absurdum:'
      gradually we perceive that some important questions begin to emerge. Here,
      as everywhere else, Plato is making war against the philosophers who put
      words in the place of things, who tear arguments to tatters, who deny
      predication, and thus make knowledge impossible, to whom ideas and objects
      of sense have no fixedness, but are in a state of perpetual oscillation
      and transition. Two great truths seem to be indirectly taught through
      these fallacies: (1) The uncertainty of language, which allows the same
      words to be used in different meanings, or with different degrees of
      meaning: (2) The necessary limitation or relative nature of all phenomena.
      Plato is aware that his own doctrine of ideas, as well as the Eleatic
      Being and Not-being, alike admit of being regarded as verbal fallacies.
      The sophism advanced in the Meno, 'that you cannot enquire either into
      what you know or do not know,' is lightly touched upon at the commencement
      of the Dialogue; the thesis of Protagoras, that everything is true to him
      to whom it seems to be true, is satirized. In contrast with these
      fallacies is maintained the Socratic doctrine that happiness is gained by
      knowledge. The grammatical puzzles with which the Dialogue concludes
      probably contain allusions to tricks of language which may have been
      practised by the disciples of Prodicus or Antisthenes. They would have had
      more point, if we were acquainted with the writings against which Plato's
      humour is directed. Most of the jests appear to have a serious meaning;
      but we have lost the clue to some of them, and cannot determine whether,
      as in the Cratylus, Plato has or has not mixed up purely unmeaning fun
      with his satire.
    </p>
<p>
      The two discourses of Socrates may be contrasted in several respects with
      the exhibition of the Sophists: (1) In their perfect relevancy to the
      subject of discussion, whereas the Sophistical discourses are wholly
      irrelevant: (2) In their enquiring sympathetic tone, which encourages the
      youth, instead of 'knocking him down,' after the manner of the two
      Sophists: (3) In the absence of any definite conclusion—for while
      Socrates and the youth are agreed that philosophy is to be studied, they
      are not able to arrive at any certain result about the art which is to
      teach it. This is a question which will hereafter be answered in the
      Republic; as the conception of the kingly art is more fully developed in
      the Politicus, and the caricature of rhetoric in the Gorgias.
    </p>
<p>
      The characters of the Dialogue are easily intelligible. There is Socrates
      once more in the character of an old man; and his equal in years, Crito,
      the father of Critobulus, like Lysimachus in the Laches, his fellow
      demesman (Apol.), to whom the scene is narrated, and who once or twice
      interrupts with a remark after the manner of the interlocutor in the
      Phaedo, and adds his commentary at the end; Socrates makes a playful
      allusion to his money-getting habits. There is the youth Cleinias, the
      grandson of Alcibiades, who may be compared with Lysis, Charmides,
      Menexenus, and other ingenuous youths out of whose mouths Socrates draws
      his own lessons, and to whom he always seems to stand in a kindly and
      sympathetic relation. Crito will not believe that Socrates has not
      improved or perhaps invented the answers of Cleinias (compare Phaedrus).
      The name of the grandson of Alcibiades, who is described as long dead,
      (Greek), and who died at the age of forty-four, in the year 404 B.C.,
      suggests not only that the intended scene of the Euthydemus could not have
      been earlier than 404, but that as a fact this Dialogue could not have
      been composed before 390 at the soonest. Ctesippus, who is the lover of
      Cleinias, has been already introduced to us in the Lysis, and seems there
      too to deserve the character which is here given him, of a somewhat
      uproarious young man. But the chief study of all is the picture of the two
      brothers, who are unapproachable in their effrontery, equally careless of
      what they say to others and of what is said to them, and never at a loss.
      They are 'Arcades ambo et cantare pares et respondere parati.' Some
      superior degree of wit or subtlety is attributed to Euthydemus, who sees
      the trap in which Socrates catches Dionysodorus.
    </p>
<p>
      The epilogue or conclusion of the Dialogue has been criticised as
      inconsistent with the general scheme. Such a criticism is like similar
      criticisms on Shakespeare, and proceeds upon a narrow notion of the
      variety which the Dialogue, like the drama, seems to admit. Plato in the
      abundance of his dramatic power has chosen to write a play upon a play,
      just as he often gives us an argument within an argument. At the same time
      he takes the opportunity of assailing another class of persons who are as
      alien from the spirit of philosophy as Euthydemus and Dionysodorus. The
      Eclectic, the Syncretist, the Doctrinaire, have been apt to have a bad
      name both in ancient and modern times. The persons whom Plato ridicules in
      the epilogue to the Euthydemus are of this class. They occupy a
      border-ground between philosophy and politics; they keep out of the
      dangers of politics, and at the same time use philosophy as a means of
      serving their own interests. Plato quaintly describes them as making two
      good things, philosophy and politics, a little worse by perverting the
      objects of both. Men like Antiphon or Lysias would be types of the class.
      Out of a regard to the respectabilities of life, they are disposed to
      censure the interest which Socrates takes in the exhibition of the two
      brothers. They do not understand, any more than Crito, that he is pursuing
      his vocation of detecting the follies of mankind, which he finds 'not
      unpleasant.' (Compare Apol.)
    </p>
<p>
      Education is the common subject of all Plato's earlier Dialogues. The
      concluding remark of Crito, that he has a difficulty in educating his two
      sons, and the advice of Socrates to him that he should not give up
      philosophy because he has no faith in philosophers, seems to be a
      preparation for the more peremptory declaration of the Meno that 'Virtue
      cannot be taught because there are no teachers.'
    </p>
<p>
      The reasons for placing the Euthydemus early in the series are: (1) the
      similarity in plan and style to the Protagoras, Charmides, and Lysis;—the
      relation of Socrates to the Sophists is still that of humorous antagonism,
      not, as in the later Dialogues of Plato, of embittered hatred; and the
      places and persons have a considerable family likeness; (2) the Euthydemus
      belongs to the Socratic period in which Socrates is represented as willing
      to learn, but unable to teach; and in the spirit of Xenophon's
      Memorabilia, philosophy is defined as 'the knowledge which will make us
      happy;' (3) we seem to have passed the stage arrived at in the Protagoras,
      for Socrates is no longer discussing whether virtue can be taught—from
      this question he is relieved by the ingenuous declaration of the youth
      Cleinias; and (4) not yet to have reached the point at which he asserts
      'that there are no teachers.' Such grounds are precarious, as arguments
      from style and plan are apt to be (Greek). But no arguments equally strong
      can be urged in favour of assigning to the Euthydemus any other position
      in the series.

<p>
      PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: Socrates, who is the narrator of the Dialogue.
      Crito, Cleinias, Euthydemus, Dionysodorus, Ctesippus.
    </p>
<p>
      SCENE: The Lyceum.
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: Who was the person, Socrates, with whom you were talking yesterday
      at the Lyceum? There was such a crowd around you that I could not get
      within hearing, but I caught a sight of him over their heads, and I made
      out, as I thought, that he was a stranger with whom you were talking: who
      was he?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: There were two, Crito; which of them do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: The one whom I mean was seated second from you on the right-hand
      side. In the middle was Cleinias the young son of Axiochus, who has
      wonderfully grown; he is only about the age of my own Critobulus, but he
      is much forwarder and very good-looking: the other is thin and looks
      younger than he is.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: He whom you mean, Crito, is Euthydemus; and on my left hand
      there was his brother Dionysodorus, who also took part in the
      conversation.
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: Neither of them are known to me, Socrates; they are a new
      importation of Sophists, as I should imagine. Of what country are they,
      and what is their line of wisdom?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: As to their origin, I believe that they are natives of this part
      of the world, and have migrated from Chios to Thurii; they were driven out
      of Thurii, and have been living for many years past in these regions. As
      to their wisdom, about which you ask, Crito, they are wonderful—consummate!
      I never knew what the true pancratiast was before; they are simply made up
      of fighting, not like the two Acarnanian brothers who fight with their
      bodies only, but this pair of heroes, besides being perfect in the use of
      their bodies, are invincible in every sort of warfare; for they are
      capital at fighting in armour, and will teach the art to any one who pays
      them; and also they are most skilful in legal warfare; they will plead
      themselves and teach others to speak and to compose speeches which will
      have an effect upon the courts. And this was only the beginning of their
      wisdom, but they have at last carried out the pancratiastic art to the
      very end, and have mastered the only mode of fighting which had been
      hitherto neglected by them; and now no one dares even to stand up against
      them: such is their skill in the war of words, that they can refute any
      proposition whether true or false. Now I am thinking, Crito, of placing
      myself in their hands; for they say that in a short time they can impart
      their skill to any one.
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: But, Socrates, are you not too old? there may be reason to fear
      that.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Certainly not, Crito; as I will prove to you, for I have the
      consolation of knowing that they began this art of disputation which I
      covet, quite, as I may say, in old age; last year, or the year before,
      they had none of their new wisdom. I am only apprehensive that I may bring
      the two strangers into disrepute, as I have done Connus the son of
      Metrobius, the harp-player, who is still my music-master; for when the
      boys who go to him see me going with them, they laugh at me and call him
      grandpapa's master. Now I should not like the strangers to experience
      similar treatment; the fear of ridicule may make them unwilling to receive
      me; and therefore, Crito, I shall try and persuade some old men to
      accompany me to them, as I persuaded them to go with me to Connus, and I
      hope that you will make one: and perhaps we had better take your sons as a
      bait; they will want to have them as pupils, and for the sake of them
      willing to receive us.
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: I see no objection, Socrates, if you like; but first I wish that
      you would give me a description of their wisdom, that I may know
      beforehand what we are going to learn.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: In less than no time you shall hear; for I cannot say that I did
      not attend—I paid great attention to them, and I remember and will
      endeavour to repeat the whole story. Providentially I was sitting alone in
      the dressing-room of the Lyceum where you saw me, and was about to depart;
      when I was getting up I recognized the familiar divine sign: so I sat down
      again, and in a little while the two brothers Euthydemus and Dionysodorus
      came in, and several others with them, whom I believe to be their
      disciples, and they walked about in the covered court; they had not taken
      more than two or three turns when Cleinias entered, who, as you truly say,
      is very much improved: he was followed by a host of lovers, one of whom
      was Ctesippus the Paeanian, a well-bred youth, but also having the
      wildness of youth. Cleinias saw me from the entrance as I was sitting
      alone, and at once came and sat down on the right hand of me, as you
      describe; and Dionysodorus and Euthydemus, when they saw him, at first
      stopped and talked with one another, now and then glancing at us, for I
      particularly watched them; and then Euthydemus came and sat down by the
      youth, and the other by me on the left hand; the rest anywhere. I saluted
      the brothers, whom I had not seen for a long time; and then I said to
      Cleinias: Here are two wise men, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, Cleinias,
      wise not in a small but in a large way of wisdom, for they know all about
      war,—all that a good general ought to know about the array and
      command of an army, and the whole art of fighting in armour: and they know
      about law too, and can teach a man how to use the weapons of the courts
      when he is injured.
    </p>
<p>
      They heard me say this, but only despised me. I observed that they looked
      at one another, and both of them laughed; and then Euthydemus said: Those,
      Socrates, are matters which we no longer pursue seriously; to us they are
      secondary occupations.
    </p>
<p>
      Indeed, I said, if such occupations are regarded by you as secondary, what
      must the principal one be; tell me, I beseech you, what that noble study
      is?
    </p>
<p>
      The teaching of virtue, Socrates, he replied, is our principal occupation;
      and we believe that we can impart it better and quicker than any man.
    </p>
<p>
      My God! I said, and where did you learn that? I always thought, as I was
      saying just now, that your chief accomplishment was the art of fighting in
      armour; and I used to say as much of you, for I remember that you
      professed this when you were here before. But now if you really have the
      other knowledge, O forgive me: I address you as I would superior beings,
      and ask you to pardon the impiety of my former expressions. But are you
      quite sure about this, Dionysodorus and Euthydemus? the promise is so
      vast, that a feeling of incredulity steals over me.
    </p>
<p>
      You may take our word, Socrates, for the fact.
    </p>
<p>
      Then I think you happier in having such a treasure than the great king is
      in the possession of his kingdom. And please to tell me whether you intend
      to exhibit your wisdom; or what will you do?
    </p>
<p>
      That is why we have come hither, Socrates; and our purpose is not only to
      exhibit, but also to teach any one who likes to learn.
    </p>
<p>
      But I can promise you, I said, that every unvirtuous person will want to
      learn. I shall be the first; and there is the youth Cleinias, and
      Ctesippus: and here are several others, I said, pointing to the lovers of
      Cleinias, who were beginning to gather round us. Now Ctesippus was sitting
      at some distance from Cleinias; and when Euthydemus leaned forward in
      talking with me, he was prevented from seeing Cleinias, who was between
      us; and so, partly because he wanted to look at his love, and also because
      he was interested, he jumped up and stood opposite to us: and all the
      other admirers of Cleinias, as well as the disciples of Euthydemus and
      Dionysodorus, followed his example. And these were the persons whom I
      showed to Euthydemus, telling him that they were all eager to learn: to
      which Ctesippus and all of them with one voice vehemently assented, and
      bid him exhibit the power of his wisdom. Then I said: O Euthydemus and
      Dionysodorus, I earnestly request you to do myself and the company the
      favour to exhibit. There may be some trouble in giving the whole
      exhibition; but tell me one thing,—can you make a good man of him
      only who is already convinced that he ought to learn of you, or of him
      also who is not convinced, either because he imagines that virtue is a
      thing which cannot be taught at all, or that you are not the teachers of
      it? Has your art power to persuade him, who is of the latter temper of
      mind, that virtue can be taught; and that you are the men from whom he
      will best learn it?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, Socrates, said Dionysodorus; our art will do both.
    </p>
<p>
      And you and your brother, Dionysodorus, I said, of all men who are now
      living are the most likely to stimulate him to philosophy and to the study
      of virtue?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, Socrates, I rather think that we are.
    </p>
<p>
      Then I wish that you would be so good as to defer the other part of the
      exhibition, and only try to persuade the youth whom you see here that he
      ought to be a philosopher and study virtue. Exhibit that, and you will
      confer a great favour on me and on every one present; for the fact is I
      and all of us are extremely anxious that he should become truly good. His
      name is Cleinias, and he is the son of Axiochus, and grandson of the old
      Alcibiades, cousin of the Alcibiades that now is. He is quite young, and
      we are naturally afraid that some one may get the start of us, and turn
      his mind in a wrong direction, and he may be ruined. Your visit,
      therefore, is most happily timed; and I hope that you will make a trial of
      the young man, and converse with him in our presence, if you have no
      objection.
    </p>
<p>
      These were pretty nearly the expressions which I used; and Euthydemus, in
      a manly and at the same time encouraging tone, replied: There can be no
      objection, Socrates, if the young man is only willing to answer questions.
    </p>
<p>
      He is quite accustomed to do so, I replied; for his friends often come and
      ask him questions and argue with him; and therefore he is quite at home in
      answering.
    </p>
<p>
      What followed, Crito, how can I rightly narrate? For not slight is the
      task of rehearsing infinite wisdom, and therefore, like the poets, I ought
      to commence my relation with an invocation to Memory and the Muses. Now
      Euthydemus, if I remember rightly, began nearly as follows: O Cleinias,
      are those who learn the wise or the ignorant?
    </p>
<p>
      The youth, overpowered by the question blushed, and in his perplexity
      looked at me for help; and I, knowing that he was disconcerted, said: Take
      courage, Cleinias, and answer like a man whichever you think; for my
      belief is that you will derive the greatest benefit from their questions.
    </p>
<p>
      Whichever he answers, said Dionysodorus, leaning forward so as to catch my
      ear, his face beaming with laughter, I prophesy that he will be refuted,
      Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      While he was speaking to me, Cleinias gave his answer: and therefore I had
      no time to warn him of the predicament in which he was placed, and he
      answered that those who learned were the wise.
    </p>
<p>
      Euthydemus proceeded: There are some whom you would call teachers, are
      there not?
    </p>
<p>
      The boy assented.
    </p>
<p>
      And they are the teachers of those who learn—the grammar-master and
      the lyre-master used to teach you and other boys; and you were the
      learners?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And when you were learners you did not as yet know the things which you
      were learning?
    </p>
<p>
      No, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And were you wise then?
    </p>
<p>
      No, indeed, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      But if you were not wise you were unlearned?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      You then, learning what you did not know, were unlearned when you were
      learning?
    </p>
<p>
      The youth nodded assent.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the unlearned learn, and not the wise, Cleinias, as you imagine.
    </p>
<p>
      At these words the followers of Euthydemus, of whom I spoke, like a chorus
      at the bidding of their director, laughed and cheered. Then, before the
      youth had time to recover his breath, Dionysodorus cleverly took him in
      hand, and said: Yes, Cleinias; and when the grammar-master dictated
      anything to you, were they the wise boys or the unlearned who learned the
      dictation?
    </p>
<p>
      The wise, replied Cleinias.
    </p>
<p>
      Then after all the wise are the learners and not the unlearned; and your
      last answer to Euthydemus was wrong.
    </p>
<p>
      Then once more the admirers of the two heroes, in an ecstasy at their
      wisdom, gave vent to another peal of laughter, while the rest of us were
      silent and amazed. Euthydemus, observing this, determined to persevere
      with the youth; and in order to heighten the effect went on asking another
      similar question, which might be compared to the double turn of an expert
      dancer. Do those, said he, who learn, learn what they know, or what they
      do not know?
    </p>
<p>
      Again Dionysodorus whispered to me: That, Socrates, is just another of the
      same sort.
    </p>
<p>
      Good heavens, I said; and your last question was so good!
    </p>
<p>
      Like all our other questions, Socrates, he replied—inevitable.
    </p>
<p>
      I see the reason, I said, why you are in such reputation among your
      disciples.
    </p>
<p>
      Meanwhile Cleinias had answered Euthydemus that those who learned learn
      what they do not know; and he put him through a series of questions the
      same as before.
    </p>
<p>
      Do you not know letters?
    </p>
<p>
      He assented.
    </p>
<p>
      All letters?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      But when the teacher dictates to you, does he not dictate letters?
    </p>
<p>
      To this also he assented.
    </p>
<p>
      Then if you know all letters, he dictates that which you know?
    </p>
<p>
      This again was admitted by him.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, said the other, you do not learn that which he dictates; but he only
      who does not know letters learns?
    </p>
<p>
      Nay, said Cleinias; but I do learn.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, said he, you learn what you know, if you know all the letters?
    </p>
<p>
      He admitted that.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, he said, you were wrong in your answer.
    </p>
<p>
      The word was hardly out of his mouth when Dionysodorus took up the
      argument, like a ball which he caught, and had another throw at the youth.
      Cleinias, he said, Euthydemus is deceiving you. For tell me now, is not
      learning acquiring knowledge of that which one learns?
    </p>
<p>
      Cleinias assented.
    </p>
<p>
      And knowing is having knowledge at the time?
    </p>
<p>
      He agreed.
    </p>
<p>
      And not knowing is not having knowledge at the time?
    </p>
<p>
      He admitted that.
    </p>
<p>
      And are those who acquire those who have or have not a thing?
    </p>
<p>
      Those who have not.
    </p>
<p>
      And have you not admitted that those who do not know are of the number of
      those who have not?
    </p>
<p>
      He nodded assent.
    </p>
<p>
      Then those who learn are of the class of those who acquire, and not of
      those who have?
    </p>
<p>
      He agreed.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, Cleinias, he said, those who do not know learn, and not those who
      know.
    </p>
<p>
      Euthydemus was proceeding to give the youth a third fall; but I knew that
      he was in deep water, and therefore, as I wanted to give him a respite
      lest he should be disheartened, I said to him consolingly: You must not be
      surprised, Cleinias, at the singularity of their mode of speech: this I
      say because you may not understand what the two strangers are doing with
      you; they are only initiating you after the manner of the Corybantes in
      the mysteries; and this answers to the enthronement, which, if you have
      ever been initiated, is, as you will know, accompanied by dancing and
      sport; and now they are just prancing and dancing about you, and will next
      proceed to initiate you; imagine then that you have gone through the first
      part of the sophistical ritual, which, as Prodicus says, begins with
      initiation into the correct use of terms. The two foreign gentlemen,
      perceiving that you did not know, wanted to explain to you that the word
      'to learn' has two meanings, and is used, first, in the sense of acquiring
      knowledge of some matter of which you previously have no knowledge, and
      also, when you have the knowledge, in the sense of reviewing this matter,
      whether something done or spoken by the light of this newly-acquired
      knowledge; the latter is generally called 'knowing' rather than
      'learning,' but the word 'learning' is also used; and you did not see, as
      they explained to you, that the term is employed of two opposite sorts of
      men, of those who know, and of those who do not know. There was a similar
      trick in the second question, when they asked you whether men learn what
      they know or what they do not know. These parts of learning are not
      serious, and therefore I say that the gentlemen are not serious, but are
      only playing with you. For if a man had all that sort of knowledge that
      ever was, he would not be at all the wiser; he would only be able to play
      with men, tripping them up and oversetting them with distinctions of
      words. He would be like a person who pulls away a stool from some one when
      he is about to sit down, and then laughs and makes merry at the sight of
      his friend overturned and laid on his back. And you must regard all that
      has hitherto passed between you and them as merely play. But in what is to
      follow I am certain that they will exhibit to you their serious purpose,
      and keep their promise (I will show them how); for they promised to give
      me a sample of the hortatory philosophy, but I suppose that they wanted to
      have a game with you first. And now, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, I think
      that we have had enough of this. Will you let me see you explaining to the
      young man how he is to apply himself to the study of virtue and wisdom?
      And I will first show you what I conceive to be the nature of the task,
      and what sort of a discourse I desire to hear; and if I do this in a very
      inartistic and ridiculous manner, do not laugh at me, for I only venture
      to improvise before you because I am eager to hear your wisdom: and I must
      therefore ask you and your disciples to refrain from laughing. And now, O
      son of Axiochus, let me put a question to you: Do not all men desire
      happiness? And yet, perhaps, this is one of those ridiculous questions
      which I am afraid to ask, and which ought not to be asked by a sensible
      man: for what human being is there who does not desire happiness?
    </p>
<p>
      There is no one, said Cleinias, who does not.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, then, I said, since we all of us desire happiness, how can we be
      happy?—that is the next question. Shall we not be happy if we have
      many good things? And this, perhaps, is even a more simple question than
      the first, for there can be no doubt of the answer.
    </p>
<p>
      He assented.
    </p>
<p>
      And what things do we esteem good? No solemn sage is required to tell us
      this, which may be easily answered; for every one will say that wealth is
      a good.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And are not health and beauty goods, and other personal gifts?
    </p>
<p>
      He agreed.
    </p>
<p>
      Can there be any doubt that good birth, and power, and honours in one's
      own land, are goods?
    </p>
<p>
      He assented.
    </p>
<p>
      And what other goods are there? I said. What do you say of temperance,
      justice, courage: do you not verily and indeed think, Cleinias, that we
      shall be more right in ranking them as goods than in not ranking them as
      goods? For a dispute might possibly arise about this. What then do you
      say?
    </p>
<p>
      They are goods, said Cleinias.
    </p>
<p>
      Very well, I said; and where in the company shall we find a place for
      wisdom—among the goods or not?
    </p>
<p>
      Among the goods.
    </p>
<p>
      And now, I said, think whether we have left out any considerable goods.
    </p>
<p>
      I do not think that we have, said Cleinias.
    </p>
<p>
      Upon recollection, I said, indeed I am afraid that we have left out the
      greatest of them all.
    </p>
<p>
      What is that? he asked.
    </p>
<p>
      Fortune, Cleinias, I replied; which all, even the most foolish, admit to
      be the greatest of goods.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      On second thoughts, I added, how narrowly, O son of Axiochus, have you and
      I escaped making a laughing-stock of ourselves to the strangers.
    </p>
<p>
      Why do you say so?
    </p>
<p>
      Why, because we have already spoken of good-fortune, and are but repeating
      ourselves.
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      I mean that there is something ridiculous in again putting forward
      good-fortune, which has a place in the list already, and saying the same
      thing twice over.
    </p>
<p>
      He asked what was the meaning of this, and I replied: Surely wisdom is
      good-fortune; even a child may know that.
    </p>
<p>
      The simple-minded youth was amazed; and, observing his surprise, I said to
      him: Do you not know, Cleinias, that flute-players are most fortunate and
      successful in performing on the flute?
    </p>
<p>
      He assented.
    </p>
<p>
      And are not the scribes most fortunate in writing and reading letters?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Amid the dangers of the sea, again, are any more fortunate on the whole
      than wise pilots?
    </p>
<p>
      None, certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And if you were engaged in war, in whose company would you rather take the
      risk—in company with a wise general, or with a foolish one?
    </p>
<p>
      With a wise one.
    </p>
<p>
      And if you were ill, whom would you rather have as a companion in a
      dangerous illness—a wise physician, or an ignorant one?
    </p>
<p>
      A wise one.
    </p>
<p>
      You think, I said, that to act with a wise man is more fortunate than to
      act with an ignorant one?
    </p>
<p>
      He assented.
    </p>
<p>
      Then wisdom always makes men fortunate: for by wisdom no man would ever
      err, and therefore he must act rightly and succeed, or his wisdom would be
      wisdom no longer.
    </p>
<p>
      We contrived at last, somehow or other, to agree in a general conclusion,
      that he who had wisdom had no need of fortune. I then recalled to his mind
      the previous state of the question. You remember, I said, our making the
      admission that we should be happy and fortunate if many good things were
      present with us?
    </p>
<p>
      He assented.
    </p>
<p>
      And should we be happy by reason of the presence of good things, if they
      profited us not, or if they profited us?
    </p>
<p>
      If they profited us, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And would they profit us, if we only had them and did not use them? For
      example, if we had a great deal of food and did not eat, or a great deal
      of drink and did not drink, should we be profited?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Or would an artisan, who had all the implements necessary for his work,
      and did not use them, be any the better for the possession of them? For
      example, would a carpenter be any the better for having all his tools and
      plenty of wood, if he never worked?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And if a person had wealth and all the goods of which we were just now
      speaking, and did not use them, would he be happy because he possessed
      them?
    </p>
<p>
      No indeed, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, I said, a man who would be happy must not only have the good things,
      but he must also use them; there is no advantage in merely having them?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, Cleinias, but if you have the use as well as the possession of good
      things, is that sufficient to confer happiness?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, in my opinion.
    </p>
<p>
      And may a person use them either rightly or wrongly?
    </p>
<p>
      He must use them rightly.
    </p>
<p>
      That is quite true, I said. And the wrong use of a thing is far worse than
      the non-use; for the one is an evil, and the other is neither a good nor
      an evil. You admit that?
    </p>
<p>
      He assented.
    </p>
<p>
      Now in the working and use of wood, is not that which gives the right use
      simply the knowledge of the carpenter?
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing else, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And surely, in the manufacture of vessels, knowledge is that which gives
      the right way of making them?
    </p>
<p>
      He agreed.
    </p>
<p>
      And in the use of the goods of which we spoke at first—wealth and
      health and beauty, is not knowledge that which directs us to the right use
      of them, and regulates our practice about them?
    </p>
<p>
      He assented.
    </p>
<p>
      Then in every possession and every use of a thing, knowledge is that which
      gives a man not only good-fortune but success?
    </p>
<p>
      He again assented.
    </p>
<p>
      And tell me, I said, O tell me, what do possessions profit a man, if he
      have neither good sense nor wisdom? Would a man be better off, having and
      doing many things without wisdom, or a few things with wisdom? Look at the
      matter thus: If he did fewer things would he not make fewer mistakes? if
      he made fewer mistakes would he not have fewer misfortunes? and if he had
      fewer misfortunes would he not be less miserable?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And who would do least—a poor man or a rich man?
    </p>
<p>
      A poor man.
    </p>
<p>
      A weak man or a strong man?
    </p>
<p>
      A weak man.
    </p>
<p>
      A noble man or a mean man?
    </p>
<p>
      A mean man.
    </p>
<p>
      And a coward would do less than a courageous and temperate man?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And an indolent man less than an active man?
    </p>
<p>
      He assented.
    </p>
<p>
      And a slow man less than a quick; and one who had dull perceptions of
      seeing and hearing less than one who had keen ones?
    </p>
<p>
      All this was mutually allowed by us.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, I said, Cleinias, the sum of the matter appears to be that the goods
      of which we spoke before are not to be regarded as goods in themselves,
      but the degree of good and evil in them depends on whether they are or are
      not under the guidance of knowledge: under the guidance of ignorance, they
      are greater evils than their opposites, inasmuch as they are more able to
      minister to the evil principle which rules them; and when under the
      guidance of wisdom and prudence, they are greater goods: but in themselves
      they are nothing?
    </p>
<p>
      That, he replied, is obvious.
    </p>
<p>
      What then is the result of what has been said? Is not this the result—that
      other things are indifferent, and that wisdom is the only good, and
      ignorance the only evil?
    </p>
<p>
      He assented.
    </p>
<p>
      Let us consider a further point, I said: Seeing that all men desire
      happiness, and happiness, as has been shown, is gained by a use, and a
      right use, of the things of life, and the right use of them, and
      good-fortune in the use of them, is given by knowledge,—the
      inference is that everybody ought by all means to try and make himself as
      wise as he can?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And when a man thinks that he ought to obtain this treasure, far more than
      money, from a father or a guardian or a friend or a suitor, whether
      citizen or stranger—the eager desire and prayer to them that they
      would impart wisdom to you, is not at all dishonourable, Cleinias; nor is
      any one to be blamed for doing any honourable service or ministration to
      any man, whether a lover or not, if his aim is to get wisdom. Do you
      agree? I said.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, I quite agree, and think that you are right.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, Cleinias, if only wisdom can be taught, and does not come to
      man spontaneously; for this is a point which has still to be considered,
      and is not yet agreed upon by you and me—
    </p>
<p>
      But I think, Socrates, that wisdom can be taught, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Best of men, I said, I am delighted to hear you say so; and I am also
      grateful to you for having saved me from a long and tiresome investigation
      as to whether wisdom can be taught or not. But now, as you think that
      wisdom can be taught, and that wisdom only can make a man happy and
      fortunate, will you not acknowledge that all of us ought to love wisdom,
      and you individually will try to love her?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, Socrates, he said; I will do my best.
    </p>
<p>
      I was pleased at hearing this; and I turned to Dionysodorus and Euthydemus
      and said: That is an example, clumsy and tedious I admit, of the sort of
      exhortations which I would have you give; and I hope that one of you will
      set forth what I have been saying in a more artistic style: or at least
      take up the enquiry where I left off, and proceed to show the youth
      whether he should have all knowledge; or whether there is one sort of
      knowledge only which will make him good and happy, and what that is. For,
      as I was saying at first, the improvement of this young man in virtue and
      wisdom is a matter which we have very much at heart.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus I spoke, Crito, and was all attention to what was coming. I wanted to
      see how they would approach the question, and where they would start in
      their exhortation to the young man that he should practise wisdom and
      virtue. Dionysodorus, who was the elder, spoke first. Everybody's eyes
      were directed towards him, perceiving that something wonderful might
      shortly be expected. And certainly they were not far wrong; for the man,
      Crito, began a remarkable discourse well worth hearing, and wonderfully
      persuasive regarded as an exhortation to virtue.
    </p>
<p>
      Tell me, he said, Socrates and the rest of you who say that you want this
      young man to become wise, are you in jest or in real earnest?
    </p>
<p>
      I was led by this to imagine that they fancied us to have been jesting
      when we asked them to converse with the youth, and that this made them
      jest and play, and being under this impression, I was the more decided in
      saying that we were in profound earnest. Dionysodorus said:
    </p>
<p>
      Reflect, Socrates; you may have to deny your words.
    </p>
<p>
      I have reflected, I said; and I shall never deny my words.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, said he, and so you say that you wish Cleinias to become wise?
    </p>
<p>
      Undoubtedly.
    </p>
<p>
      And he is not wise as yet?
    </p>
<p>
      At least his modesty will not allow him to say that he is.
    </p>
<p>
      You wish him, he said, to become wise and not, to be ignorant?
    </p>
<p>
      That we do.
    </p>
<p>
      You wish him to be what he is not, and no longer to be what he is?
    </p>
<p>
      I was thrown into consternation at this.
    </p>
<p>
      Taking advantage of my consternation he added: You wish him no longer to
      be what he is, which can only mean that you wish him to perish. Pretty
      lovers and friends they must be who want their favourite not to be, or to
      perish!
    </p>
<p>
      When Ctesippus heard this he got very angry (as a lover well might) and
      said: Stranger of Thurii—if politeness would allow me I should say,
      A plague upon you! What can make you tell such a lie about me and the
      others, which I hardly like to repeat, as that I wish Cleinias to perish?
    </p>
<p>
      Euthydemus replied: And do you think, Ctesippus, that it is possible to
      tell a lie?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, said Ctesippus; I should be mad to say anything else.
    </p>
<p>
      And in telling a lie, do you tell the thing of which you speak or not?
    </p>
<p>
      You tell the thing of which you speak.
    </p>
<p>
      And he who tells, tells that thing which he tells, and no other?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, said Ctesippus.
    </p>
<p>
      And that is a distinct thing apart from other things?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And he who says that thing says that which is?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And he who says that which is, says the truth. And therefore Dionysodorus,
      if he says that which is, says the truth of you and no lie.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, Euthydemus, said Ctesippus; but in saying this, he says what is not.
    </p>
<p>
      Euthydemus answered: And that which is not is not?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And that which is not is nowhere?
    </p>
<p>
      Nowhere.
    </p>
<p>
      And can any one do anything about that which has no existence, or do to
      Cleinias that which is not and is nowhere?
    </p>
<p>
      I think not, said Ctesippus.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, but do rhetoricians, when they speak in the assembly, do nothing?
    </p>
<p>
      Nay, he said, they do something.
    </p>
<p>
      And doing is making?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And speaking is doing and making?
    </p>
<p>
      He agreed.
    </p>
<p>
      Then no one says that which is not, for in saying what is not he would be
      doing something; and you have already acknowledged that no one can do what
      is not. And therefore, upon your own showing, no one says what is false;
      but if Dionysodorus says anything, he says what is true and what is.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, Euthydemus, said Ctesippus; but he speaks of things in a certain way
      and manner, and not as they really are.
    </p>
<p>
      Why, Ctesippus, said Dionysodorus, do you mean to say that any one speaks
      of things as they are?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said—all gentlemen and truth-speaking persons.
    </p>
<p>
      And are not good things good, and evil things evil?
    </p>
<p>
      He assented.
    </p>
<p>
      And you say that gentlemen speak of things as they are?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the good speak evil of evil things, if they speak of them as they
      are?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, indeed, he said; and they speak evil of evil men. And if I may give
      you a piece of advice, you had better take care that they do not speak
      evil of you, since I can tell you that the good speak evil of the evil.
    </p>
<p>
      And do they speak great things of the great, rejoined Euthydemus, and warm
      things of the warm?
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure they do, said Ctesippus; and they speak coldly of the insipid
      and cold dialectician.
    </p>
<p>
      You are abusive, Ctesippus, said Dionysodorus, you are abusive!
    </p>
<p>
      Indeed, I am not, Dionysodorus, he replied; for I love you and am giving
      you friendly advice, and, if I could, would persuade you not like a boor
      to say in my presence that I desire my beloved, whom I value above all
      men, to perish.
    </p>
<p>
      I saw that they were getting exasperated with one another, so I made a
      joke with him and said: O Ctesippus, I think that we must allow the
      strangers to use language in their own way, and not quarrel with them
      about words, but be thankful for what they give us. If they know how to
      destroy men in such a way as to make good and sensible men out of bad and
      foolish ones—whether this is a discovery of their own, or whether
      they have learned from some one else this new sort of death and
      destruction which enables them to get rid of a bad man and turn him into a
      good one—if they know this (and they do know this—at any rate
      they said just now that this was the secret of their newly-discovered art)—let
      them, in their phraseology, destroy the youth and make him wise, and all
      of us with him. But if you young men do not like to trust yourselves with
      them, then fiat experimentum in corpore senis; I will be the Carian on
      whom they shall operate. And here I offer my old person to Dionysodorus;
      he may put me into the pot, like Medea the Colchian, kill me, boil me, if
      he will only make me good.
    </p>
<p>
      Ctesippus said: And I, Socrates, am ready to commit myself to the
      strangers; they may skin me alive, if they please (and I am pretty well
      skinned by them already), if only my skin is made at last, not like that
      of Marsyas, into a leathern bottle, but into a piece of virtue. And here
      is Dionysodorus fancying that I am angry with him, when really I am not
      angry at all; I do but contradict him when I think that he is speaking
      improperly to me: and you must not confound abuse and contradiction, O
      illustrious Dionysodorus; for they are quite different things.
    </p>
<p>
      Contradiction! said Dionysodorus; why, there never was such a thing.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly there is, he replied; there can be no question of that. Do you,
      Dionysodorus, maintain that there is not?
    </p>
<p>
      You will never prove to me, he said, that you have heard any one
      contradicting any one else.
    </p>
<p>
      Indeed, said Ctesippus; then now you may hear me contradicting
      Dionysodorus.
    </p>
<p>
      Are you prepared to make that good?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, have not all things words expressive of them?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Of their existence or of their non-existence?
    </p>
<p>
      Of their existence.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, Ctesippus, and we just now proved, as you may remember, that no man
      could affirm a negative; for no one could affirm that which is not.
    </p>
<p>
      And what does that signify? said Ctesippus; you and I may contradict all
      the same for that.
    </p>
<p>
      But can we contradict one another, said Dionysodorus, when both of us are
      describing the same thing? Then we must surely be speaking the same thing?
    </p>
<p>
      He assented.
    </p>
<p>
      Or when neither of us is speaking of the same thing? For then neither of
      us says a word about the thing at all?
    </p>
<p>
      He granted that proposition also.
    </p>
<p>
      But when I describe something and you describe another thing, or I say
      something and you say nothing—is there any contradiction? How can he
      who speaks contradict him who speaks not?
    </p>
<p>
      Here Ctesippus was silent; and I in my astonishment said: What do you
      mean, Dionysodorus? I have often heard, and have been amazed to hear, this
      thesis of yours, which is maintained and employed by the disciples of
      Protagoras, and others before them, and which to me appears to be quite
      wonderful, and suicidal as well as destructive, and I think that I am most
      likely to hear the truth about it from you. The dictum is that there is no
      such thing as falsehood; a man must either say what is true or say
      nothing. Is not that your position?
    </p>
<p>
      He assented.
    </p>
<p>
      But if he cannot speak falsely, may he not think falsely?
    </p>
<p>
      No, he cannot, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then there is no such thing as false opinion?
    </p>
<p>
      No, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then there is no such thing as ignorance, or men who are ignorant; for is
      not ignorance, if there be such a thing, a mistake of fact?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And that is impossible?
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Are you saying this as a paradox, Dionysodorus; or do you seriously
      maintain no man to be ignorant?
    </p>
<p>
      Refute me, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      But how can I refute you, if, as you say, to tell a falsehood is
      impossible?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, said Euthydemus.
    </p>
<p>
      Neither did I tell you just now to refute me, said Dionysodorus; for how
      can I tell you to do that which is not?
    </p>
<p>
      O Euthydemus, I said, I have but a dull conception of these subtleties and
      excellent devices of wisdom; I am afraid that I hardly understand them,
      and you must forgive me therefore if I ask a very stupid question: if
      there be no falsehood or false opinion or ignorance, there can be no such
      thing as erroneous action, for a man cannot fail of acting as he is acting—that
      is what you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And now, I said, I will ask my stupid question: If there is no such thing
      as error in deed, word, or thought, then what, in the name of goodness, do
      you come hither to teach? And were you not just now saying that you could
      teach virtue best of all men, to any one who was willing to learn?
    </p>
<p>
      And are you such an old fool, Socrates, rejoined Dionysodorus, that you
      bring up now what I said at first—and if I had said anything last
      year, I suppose that you would bring that up too—but are non-plussed
      at the words which I have just uttered?
    </p>
<p>
      Why, I said, they are not easy to answer; for they are the words of wise
      men: and indeed I know not what to make of this word 'nonplussed,' which
      you used last: what do you mean by it, Dionysodorus? You must mean that I
      cannot refute your argument. Tell me if the words have any other sense.
    </p>
<p>
      No, he replied, they mean what you say. And now answer.
    </p>
<p>
      What, before you, Dionysodorus? I said.
    </p>
<p>
      Answer, said he.
    </p>
<p>
      And is that fair?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, quite fair, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Upon what principle? I said. I can only suppose that you are a very wise
      man who comes to us in the character of a great logician, and who knows
      when to answer and when not to answer—and now you will not open your
      mouth at all, because you know that you ought not.
    </p>
<p>
      You prate, he said, instead of answering. But if, my good sir, you admit
      that I am wise, answer as I tell you.
    </p>
<p>
      I suppose that I must obey, for you are master. Put the question.
    </p>
<p>
      Are the things which have sense alive or lifeless?
    </p>
<p>
      They are alive.
    </p>
<p>
      And do you know of any word which is alive?
    </p>
<p>
      I cannot say that I do.
    </p>
<p>
      Then why did you ask me what sense my words had?
    </p>
<p>
      Why, because I was stupid and made a mistake. And yet, perhaps, I was
      right after all in saying that words have a sense;—what do you say,
      wise man? If I was not in error, even you will not refute me, and all your
      wisdom will be non-plussed; but if I did fall into error, then again you
      are wrong in saying that there is no error,—and this remark was made
      by you not quite a year ago. I am inclined to think, however, Dionysodorus
      and Euthydemus, that this argument lies where it was and is not very
      likely to advance: even your skill in the subtleties of logic, which is
      really amazing, has not found out the way of throwing another and not
      falling yourself, now any more than of old.
    </p>
<p>
      Ctesippus said: Men of Chios, Thurii, or however and whatever you call
      yourselves, I wonder at you, for you seem to have no objection to talking
      nonsense.
    </p>
<p>
      Fearing that there would be high words, I again endeavoured to soothe
      Ctesippus, and said to him: To you, Ctesippus, I must repeat what I said
      before to Cleinias—that you do not understand the ways of these
      philosophers from abroad. They are not serious, but, like the Egyptian
      wizard, Proteus, they take different forms and deceive us by their
      enchantments: and let us, like Menelaus, refuse to let them go until they
      show themselves to us in earnest. When they begin to be in earnest their
      full beauty will appear: let us then beg and entreat and beseech them to
      shine forth. And I think that I had better once more exhibit the form in
      which I pray to behold them; it might be a guide to them. I will go on
      therefore where I left off, as well as I can, in the hope that I may touch
      their hearts and move them to pity, and that when they see me deeply
      serious and interested, they also may be serious. You, Cleinias, I said,
      shall remind me at what point we left off. Did we not agree that
      philosophy should be studied? and was not that our conclusion?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And philosophy is the acquisition of knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And what knowledge ought we to acquire? May we not answer with absolute
      truth—A knowledge which will do us good?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And should we be any the better if we went about having a knowledge of the
      places where most gold was hidden in the earth?
    </p>
<p>
      Perhaps we should, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      But have we not already proved, I said, that we should be none the better
      off, even if without trouble and digging all the gold which there is in
      the earth were ours? And if we knew how to convert stones into gold, the
      knowledge would be of no value to us, unless we also knew how to use the
      gold? Do you not remember? I said.
    </p>
<p>
      I quite remember, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor would any other knowledge, whether of money-making, or of medicine, or
      of any other art which knows only how to make a thing, and not to use it
      when made, be of any good to us. Am I not right?
    </p>
<p>
      He agreed.
    </p>
<p>
      And if there were a knowledge which was able to make men immortal, without
      giving them the knowledge of the way to use the immortality, neither would
      there be any use in that, if we may argue from the analogy of the previous
      instances?
    </p>
<p>
      To all this he agreed.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, my dear boy, I said, the knowledge which we want is one that uses as
      well as makes?
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And our desire is not to be skilful lyre-makers, or artists of that sort—far
      otherwise; for with them the art which makes is one, and the art which
      uses is another. Although they have to do with the same, they are divided:
      for the art which makes and the art which plays on the lyre differ widely
      from one another. Am I not right?
    </p>
<p>
      He agreed.
    </p>
<p>
      And clearly we do not want the art of the flute-maker; this is only
      another of the same sort?
    </p>
<p>
      He assented.
    </p>
<p>
      But suppose, I said, that we were to learn the art of making speeches—would
      that be the art which would make us happy?
    </p>
<p>
      I should say, no, rejoined Cleinias.
    </p>
<p>
      And why should you say so? I asked.
    </p>
<p>
      I see, he replied, that there are some composers of speeches who do not
      know how to use the speeches which they make, just as the makers of lyres
      do not know how to use the lyres; and also some who are of themselves
      unable to compose speeches, but are able to use the speeches which the
      others make for them; and this proves that the art of making speeches is
      not the same as the art of using them.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said; and I take your words to be a sufficient proof that the art
      of making speeches is not one which will make a man happy. And yet I did
      think that the art which we have so long been seeking might be discovered
      in that direction; for the composers of speeches, whenever I meet them,
      always appear to me to be very extraordinary men, Cleinias, and their art
      is lofty and divine, and no wonder. For their art is a part of the great
      art of enchantment, and hardly, if at all, inferior to it: and whereas the
      art of the enchanter is a mode of charming snakes and spiders and
      scorpions, and other monsters and pests, this art of their's acts upon
      dicasts and ecclesiasts and bodies of men, for the charming and pacifying
      of them. Do you agree with me?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, I think that you are quite right.
    </p>
<p>
      Whither then shall we go, I said, and to what art shall we have recourse?
    </p>
<p>
      I do not see my way, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      But I think that I do, I replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And what is your notion? asked Cleinias.
    </p>
<p>
      I think that the art of the general is above all others the one of which
      the possession is most likely to make a man happy.
    </p>
<p>
      I do not think so, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Why not? I said.
    </p>
<p>
      The art of the general is surely an art of hunting mankind.
    </p>
<p>
      What of that? I said.
    </p>
<p>
      Why, he said, no art of hunting extends beyond hunting and capturing; and
      when the prey is taken the huntsman or fisherman cannot use it; but they
      hand it over to the cook, and the geometricians and astronomers and
      calculators (who all belong to the hunting class, for they do not make
      their diagrams, but only find out that which was previously contained in
      them)—they, I say, not being able to use but only to catch their
      prey, hand over their inventions to the dialectician to be applied by him,
      if they have any sense in them.
    </p>
<p>
      Good, I said, fairest and wisest Cleinias. And is this true?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said; just as a general when he takes a city or a camp hands
      over his new acquisition to the statesman, for he does not know how to use
      them himself; or as the quail-taker transfers the quails to the keeper of
      them. If we are looking for the art which is to make us blessed, and which
      is able to use that which it makes or takes, the art of the general is not
      the one, and some other must be found.
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: And do you mean, Socrates, that the youngster said all this?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Are you incredulous, Crito?
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: Indeed, I am; for if he did say so, then in my opinion he needs
      neither Euthydemus nor any one else to be his instructor.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Perhaps I may have forgotten, and Ctesippus was the real
      answerer.
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: Ctesippus! nonsense.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: All I know is that I heard these words, and that they were not
      spoken either by Euthydemus or Dionysodorus. I dare say, my good Crito,
      that they may have been spoken by some superior person: that I heard them
      I am certain.
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: Yes, indeed, Socrates, by some one a good deal superior, as I
      should be disposed to think. But did you carry the search any further, and
      did you find the art which you were seeking?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Find! my dear sir, no indeed. And we cut a poor figure; we were
      like children after larks, always on the point of catching the art, which
      was always getting away from us. But why should I repeat the whole story?
      At last we came to the kingly art, and enquired whether that gave and
      caused happiness, and then we got into a labyrinth, and when we thought we
      were at the end, came out again at the beginning, having still to seek as
      much as ever.
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: How did that happen, Socrates?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: I will tell you; the kingly art was identified by us with the
      political.
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: Well, and what came of that?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: To this royal or political art all the arts, including the art
      of the general, seemed to render up the supremacy, that being the only one
      which knew how to use what they produce. Here obviously was the very art
      which we were seeking—the art which is the source of good
      government, and which may be described, in the language of Aeschylus, as
      alone sitting at the helm of the vessel of state, piloting and governing
      all things, and utilizing them.
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: And were you not right, Socrates?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You shall judge, Crito, if you are willing to hear what
      followed; for we resumed the enquiry, and a question of this sort was
      asked: Does the kingly art, having this supreme authority, do anything for
      us? To be sure, was the answer. And would not you, Crito, say the same?
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: Yes, I should.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And what would you say that the kingly art does? If medicine
      were supposed to have supreme authority over the subordinate arts, and I
      were to ask you a similar question about that, you would say—it
      produces health?
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: I should.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And what of your own art of husbandry, supposing that to have
      supreme authority over the subject arts—what does that do? Does it
      not supply us with the fruits of the earth?
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And what does the kingly art do when invested with supreme
      power? Perhaps you may not be ready with an answer?
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: Indeed I am not, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: No more were we, Crito. But at any rate you know that if this is
      the art which we were seeking, it ought to be useful.
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And surely it ought to do us some good?
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: Certainly, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And Cleinias and I had arrived at the conclusion that knowledge
      of some kind is the only good.
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: Yes, that was what you were saying.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: All the other results of politics, and they are many, as for
      example, wealth, freedom, tranquillity, were neither good nor evil in
      themselves; but the political science ought to make us wise, and impart
      knowledge to us, if that is the science which is likely to do us good, and
      make us happy.
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: Yes; that was the conclusion at which you had arrived, according to
      your report of the conversation.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And does the kingly art make men wise and good?
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: Why not, Socrates?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: What, all men, and in every respect? and teach them all the
      arts,—carpentering, and cobbling, and the rest of them?
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: I think not, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But then what is this knowledge, and what are we to do with it?
      For it is not the source of any works which are neither good nor evil, and
      gives no knowledge, but the knowledge of itself; what then can it be, and
      what are we to do with it? Shall we say, Crito, that it is the knowledge
      by which we are to make other men good?
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: By all means.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And in what will they be good and useful? Shall we repeat that
      they will make others good, and that these others will make others again,
      without ever determining in what they are to be good; for we have put
      aside the results of politics, as they are called. This is the old, old
      song over again; and we are just as far as ever, if not farther, from the
      knowledge of the art or science of happiness.
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: Indeed, Socrates, you do appear to have got into a great
      perplexity.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Thereupon, Crito, seeing that I was on the point of shipwreck, I
      lifted up my voice, and earnestly entreated and called upon the strangers
      to save me and the youth from the whirlpool of the argument; they were our
      Castor and Pollux, I said, and they should be serious, and show us in
      sober earnest what that knowledge was which would enable us to pass the
      rest of our lives in happiness.
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: And did Euthydemus show you this knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Yes, indeed; he proceeded in a lofty strain to the following
      effect: Would you rather, Socrates, said he, that I should show you this
      knowledge about which you have been doubting, or shall I prove that you
      already have it?
    </p>
<p>
      What, I said, are you blessed with such a power as this?
    </p>
<p>
      Indeed I am.
    </p>
<p>
      Then I would much rather that you should prove me to have such a
      knowledge; at my time of life that will be more agreeable than having to
      learn.
    </p>
<p>
      Then tell me, he said, do you know anything?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, I know many things, but not anything of much importance.
    </p>
<p>
      That will do, he said: And would you admit that anything is what it is,
      and at the same time is not what it is?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      And did you not say that you knew something?
    </p>
<p>
      I did.
    </p>
<p>
      If you know, you are knowing.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, of the knowledge which I have.
    </p>
<p>
      That makes no difference;—and must you not, if you are knowing, know
      all things?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not, I said, for there are many other things which I do not
      know.
    </p>
<p>
      And if you do not know, you are not knowing.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, friend, of that which I do not know.
    </p>
<p>
      Still you are not knowing, and you said just now that you were knowing;
      and therefore you are and are not at the same time, and in reference to
      the same things.
    </p>
<p>
      A pretty clatter, as men say, Euthydemus, this of yours! and will you
      explain how I possess that knowledge for which we were seeking? Do you
      mean to say that the same thing cannot be and also not be; and therefore,
      since I know one thing, that I know all, for I cannot be knowing and not
      knowing at the same time, and if I know all things, then I must have the
      knowledge for which we are seeking—May I assume this to be your
      ingenious notion?
    </p>
<p>
      Out of your own mouth, Socrates, you are convicted, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, but, Euthydemus, I said, has that never happened to you? for if I am
      only in the same case with you and our beloved Dionysodorus, I cannot
      complain. Tell me, then, you two, do you not know some things, and not
      know others?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not, Socrates, said Dionysodorus.
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean, I said; do you know nothing?
    </p>
<p>
      Nay, he replied, we do know something.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, I said, you know all things, if you know anything?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, all things, he said; and that is as true of you as of us.
    </p>
<p>
      O, indeed, I said, what a wonderful thing, and what a great blessing! And
      do all other men know all things or nothing?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he replied; they cannot know some things, and not know others,
      and be at the same time knowing and not knowing.
    </p>
<p>
      Then what is the inference? I said.
    </p>
<p>
      They all know all things, he replied, if they know one thing.
    </p>
<p>
      O heavens, Dionysodorus, I said, I see now that you are in earnest; hardly
      have I got you to that point. And do you really and truly know all things,
      including carpentering and leather-cutting?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And do you know stitching?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, by the gods, we do, and cobbling, too.
    </p>
<p>
      And do you know things such as the numbers of the stars and of the sand?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly; did you think we should say No to that?
    </p>
<p>
      By Zeus, said Ctesippus, interrupting, I only wish that you would give me
      some proof which would enable me to know whether you speak truly.
    </p>
<p>
      What proof shall I give you? he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Will you tell me how many teeth Euthydemus has? and Euthydemus shall tell
      how many teeth you have.
    </p>
<p>
      Will you not take our word that we know all things?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not, said Ctesippus: you must further tell us this one thing,
      and then we shall know that you are speak the truth; if you tell us the
      number, and we count them, and you are found to be right, we will believe
      the rest. They fancied that Ctesippus was making game of them, and they
      refused, and they would only say in answer to each of his questions, that
      they knew all things. For at last Ctesippus began to throw off all
      restraint; no question in fact was too bad for him; he would ask them if
      they knew the foulest things, and they, like wild boars, came rushing on
      his blows, and fearlessly replied that they did. At last, Crito, I too was
      carried away by my incredulity, and asked Euthydemus whether Dionysodorus
      could dance.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And can he vault among swords, and turn upon a wheel, at his age? has he
      got to such a height of skill as that?
    </p>
<p>
      He can do anything, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And did you always know this?
    </p>
<p>
      Always, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      When you were children, and at your birth?
    </p>
<p>
      They both said that they did.
    </p>
<p>
      This we could not believe. And Euthydemus said: You are incredulous,
      Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, and I might well be incredulous, if I did not know you to be
      wise men.
    </p>
<p>
      But if you will answer, he said, I will make you confess to similar
      marvels.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, I said, there is nothing that I should like better than to be
      self-convicted of this, for if I am really a wise man, which I never knew
      before, and you will prove to me that I know and have always known all
      things, nothing in life would be a greater gain to me.
    </p>
<p>
      Answer then, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Ask, I said, and I will answer.
    </p>
<p>
      Do you know something, Socrates, or nothing?
    </p>
<p>
      Something, I said.
    </p>
<p>
      And do you know with what you know, or with something else?
    </p>
<p>
      With what I know; and I suppose that you mean with my soul?
    </p>
<p>
      Are you not ashamed, Socrates, of asking a question when you are asked
      one?
    </p>
<p>
      Well, I said; but then what am I to do? for I will do whatever you bid;
      when I do not know what you are asking, you tell me to answer
      nevertheless, and not to ask again.
    </p>
<p>
      Why, you surely have some notion of my meaning, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, then, answer according to your notion of my meaning.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said; but if the question which you ask in one sense is understood
      and answered by me in another, will that please you—if I answer what
      is not to the point?
    </p>
<p>
      That will please me very well; but will not please you equally well, as I
      imagine.
    </p>
<p>
      I certainly will not answer unless I understand you, I said.
    </p>
<p>
      You will not answer, he said, according to your view of the meaning,
      because you will be prating, and are an ancient.
    </p>
<p>
      Now I saw that he was getting angry with me for drawing distinctions, when
      he wanted to catch me in his springes of words. And I remembered that
      Connus was always angry with me when I opposed him, and then he neglected
      me, because he thought that I was stupid; and as I was intending to go to
      Euthydemus as a pupil, I reflected that I had better let him have his way,
      as he might think me a blockhead, and refuse to take me. So I said: You
      are a far better dialectician than myself, Euthydemus, for I have never
      made a profession of the art, and therefore do as you say; ask your
      questions once more, and I will answer.
    </p>
<p>
      Answer then, he said, again, whether you know what you know with
      something, or with nothing.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said; I know with my soul.
    </p>
<p>
      The man will answer more than the question; for I did not ask you, he
      said, with what you know, but whether you know with something.
    </p>
<p>
      Again I replied, Through ignorance I have answered too much, but I hope
      that you will forgive me. And now I will answer simply that I always know
      what I know with something.
    </p>
<p>
      And is that something, he rejoined, always the same, or sometimes one
      thing, and sometimes another thing?
    </p>
<p>
      Always, I replied, when I know, I know with this.
    </p>
<p>
      Will you not cease adding to your answers?
    </p>
<p>
      My fear is that this word 'always' may get us into trouble.
    </p>
<p>
      You, perhaps, but certainly not us. And now answer: Do you always know
      with this?
    </p>
<p>
      Always; since I am required to withdraw the words 'when I know.'
    </p>
<p>
      You always know with this, or, always knowing, do you know some things
      with this, and some things with something else, or do you know all things
      with this?
    </p>
<p>
      All that I know, I replied, I know with this.
    </p>
<p>
      There again, Socrates, he said, the addition is superfluous.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, then, I said, I will take away the words 'that I know.'
    </p>
<p>
      Nay, take nothing away; I desire no favours of you; but let me ask: Would
      you be able to know all things, if you did not know all things?
    </p>
<p>
      Quite impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      And now, he said, you may add on whatever you like, for you confess that
      you know all things.
    </p>
<p>
      I suppose that is true, I said, if my qualification implied in the words
      'that I know' is not allowed to stand; and so I do know all things.
    </p>
<p>
      And have you not admitted that you always know all things with that which
      you know, whether you make the addition of 'when you know them' or not?
      for you have acknowledged that you have always and at once known all
      things, that is to say, when you were a child, and at your birth, and when
      you were growing up, and before you were born, and before the heaven and
      earth existed, you knew all things, if you always know them; and I swear
      that you shall always continue to know all things, if I am of the mind to
      make you.
    </p>
<p>
      But I hope that you will be of that mind, reverend Euthydemus, I said, if
      you are really speaking the truth, and yet I a little doubt your power to
      make good your words unless you have the help of your brother
      Dionysodorus; then you may do it. Tell me now, both of you, for although
      in the main I cannot doubt that I really do know all things, when I am
      told so by men of your prodigious wisdom—how can I say that I know
      such things, Euthydemus, as that the good are unjust; come, do I know that
      or not?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, you know that.
    </p>
<p>
      What do I know?
    </p>
<p>
      That the good are not unjust.
    </p>
<p>
      Quite true, I said; and that I have always known; but the question is,
      where did I learn that the good are unjust?
    </p>
<p>
      Nowhere, said Dionysodorus.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, I said, I do not know this.
    </p>
<p>
      You are ruining the argument, said Euthydemus to Dionysodorus; he will be
      proved not to know, and then after all he will be knowing and not knowing
      at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
      Dionysodorus blushed.
    </p>
<p>
      I turned to the other, and said, What do you think, Euthydemus? Does not
      your omniscient brother appear to you to have made a mistake?
    </p>
<p>
      What, replied Dionysodorus in a moment; am I the brother of Euthydemus?
    </p>
<p>
      Thereupon I said, Please not to interrupt, my good friend, or prevent
      Euthydemus from proving to me that I know the good to be unjust; such a
      lesson you might at least allow me to learn.
    </p>
<p>
      You are running away, Socrates, said Dionysodorus, and refusing to answer.
    </p>
<p>
      No wonder, I said, for I am not a match for one of you, and a fortiori I
      must run away from two. I am no Heracles; and even Heracles could not
      fight against the Hydra, who was a she-Sophist, and had the wit to shoot
      up many new heads when one of them was cut off; especially when he saw a
      second monster of a sea-crab, who was also a Sophist, and appeared to have
      newly arrived from a sea-voyage, bearing down upon him from the left,
      opening his mouth and biting. When the monster was growing troublesome he
      called Iolaus, his nephew, to his help, who ably succoured him; but if my
      Iolaus, who is my brother Patrocles (the statuary), were to come, he would
      only make a bad business worse.
    </p>
<p>
      And now that you have delivered yourself of this strain, said
      Dionysodorus, will you inform me whether Iolaus was the nephew of Heracles
      any more than he is yours?
    </p>
<p>
      I suppose that I had best answer you, Dionysodorus, I said, for you will
      insist on asking—that I pretty well know—out of envy, in order
      to prevent me from learning the wisdom of Euthydemus.
    </p>
<p>
      Then answer me, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Well then, I said, I can only reply that Iolaus was not my nephew at all,
      but the nephew of Heracles; and his father was not my brother Patrocles,
      but Iphicles, who has a name rather like his, and was the brother of
      Heracles.
    </p>
<p>
      And is Patrocles, he said, your brother?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, he is my half-brother, the son of my mother, but not of my
      father.
    </p>
<p>
      Then he is and is not your brother.
    </p>
<p>
      Not by the same father, my good man, I said, for Chaeredemus was his
      father, and mine was Sophroniscus.
    </p>
<p>
      And was Sophroniscus a father, and Chaeredemus also?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said; the former was my father, and the latter his.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, he said, Chaeredemus is not a father.
    </p>
<p>
      He is not my father, I said.
    </p>
<p>
      But can a father be other than a father? or are you the same as a stone?
    </p>
<p>
      I certainly do not think that I am a stone, I said, though I am afraid
      that you may prove me to be one.
    </p>
<p>
      Are you not other than a stone?
    </p>
<p>
      I am.
    </p>
<p>
      And being other than a stone, you are not a stone; and being other than
      gold, you are not gold?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And so Chaeredemus, he said, being other than a father, is not a father?
    </p>
<p>
      I suppose that he is not a father, I replied.
    </p>
<p>
      For if, said Euthydemus, taking up the argument, Chaeredemus is a father,
      then Sophroniscus, being other than a father, is not a father; and you,
      Socrates, are without a father.
    </p>
<p>
      Ctesippus, here taking up the argument, said: And is not your father in
      the same case, for he is other than my father?
    </p>
<p>
      Assuredly not, said Euthydemus.
    </p>
<p>
      Then he is the same?
    </p>
<p>
      He is the same.
    </p>
<p>
      I cannot say that I like the connection; but is he only my father,
      Euthydemus, or is he the father of all other men?
    </p>
<p>
      Of all other men, he replied. Do you suppose the same person to be a
      father and not a father?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, I did so imagine, said Ctesippus.
    </p>
<p>
      And do you suppose that gold is not gold, or that a man is not a man?
    </p>
<p>
      They are not 'in pari materia,' Euthydemus, said Ctesippus, and you had
      better take care, for it is monstrous to suppose that your father is the
      father of all.
    </p>
<p>
      But he is, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      What, of men only, said Ctesippus, or of horses and of all other animals?
    </p>
<p>
      Of all, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And your mother, too, is the mother of all?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, our mother too.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes; and your mother has a progeny of sea-urchins then?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes; and yours, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And gudgeons and puppies and pigs are your brothers?
    </p>
<p>
      And yours too.
    </p>
<p>
      And your papa is a dog?
    </p>
<p>
      And so is yours, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      If you will answer my questions, said Dionysodorus, I will soon extract
      the same admissions from you, Ctesippus. You say that you have a dog.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, a villain of a one, said Ctesippus.
    </p>
<p>
      And he has puppies?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, and they are very like himself.
    </p>
<p>
      And the dog is the father of them?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, I certainly saw him and the mother of the puppies come
      together.
    </p>
<p>
      And is he not yours?
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure he is.
    </p>
<p>
      Then he is a father, and he is yours; ergo, he is your father, and the
      puppies are your brothers.
    </p>
<p>
      Let me ask you one little question more, said Dionysodorus, quickly
      interposing, in order that Ctesippus might not get in his word: You beat
      this dog?
    </p>
<p>
      Ctesippus said, laughing, Indeed I do; and I only wish that I could beat
      you instead of him.
    </p>
<p>
      Then you beat your father, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      I should have far more reason to beat yours, said Ctesippus; what could he
      have been thinking of when he begat such wise sons? much good has this
      father of you and your brethren the puppies got out of this wisdom of
      yours.
    </p>
<p>
      But neither he nor you, Ctesippus, have any need of much good.
    </p>
<p>
      And have you no need, Euthydemus? he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Neither I nor any other man; for tell me now, Ctesippus, if you think it
      good or evil for a man who is sick to drink medicine when he wants it; or
      to go to war armed rather than unarmed.
    </p>
<p>
      Good, I say. And yet I know that I am going to be caught in one of your
      charming puzzles.
    </p>
<p>
      That, he replied, you will discover, if you answer; since you admit
      medicine to be good for a man to drink, when wanted, must it not be good
      for him to drink as much as possible; when he takes his medicine, a
      cartload of hellebore will not be too much for him?
    </p>
<p>
      Ctesippus said: Quite so, Euthydemus, that is to say, if he who drinks is
      as big as the statue of Delphi.
    </p>
<p>
      And seeing that in war to have arms is a good thing, he ought to have as
      many spears and shields as possible?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, said Ctesippus; and do you think, Euthydemus, that he ought to
      have one shield only, and one spear?
    </p>
<p>
      I do.
    </p>
<p>
      And would you arm Geryon and Briareus in that way? Considering that you
      and your companion fight in armour, I thought that you would have known
      better...Here Euthydemus held his peace, but Dionysodorus returned to the
      previous answer of Ctesippus and said:—
    </p>
<p>
      Do you not think that the possession of gold is a good thing?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, said Ctesippus, and the more the better.
    </p>
<p>
      And to have money everywhere and always is a good?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, a great good, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And you admit gold to be a good?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And ought not a man then to have gold everywhere and always, and as much
      as possible in himself, and may he not be deemed the happiest of men who
      has three talents of gold in his belly, and a talent in his pate, and a
      stater of gold in either eye?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, Euthydemus, said Ctesippus; and the Scythians reckon those who have
      gold in their own skulls to be the happiest and bravest of men (that is
      only another instance of your manner of speaking about the dog and
      father), and what is still more extraordinary, they drink out of their own
      skulls gilt, and see the inside of them, and hold their own head in their
      hands.
    </p>
<p>
      And do the Scythians and others see that which has the quality of vision,
      or that which has not? said Euthydemus.
    </p>
<p>
      That which has the quality of vision clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      And you also see that which has the quality of vision? he said. [Note: the
      ambiguity of (Greek), 'things visible and able to see,' (Greek), 'the
      speaking of the silent,' the silent denoting either the speaker or the
      subject of the speech, cannot be perfectly rendered in English.] Compare
      Aristot. Soph. Elenchi (Poste's translation):—
    </p>
<p>
      'Of ambiguous propositions the following are instances:—
    </p>
<p>
      'I hope that you the enemy may slay.
    </p>
<p>
      'Whom one knows, he knows. Either the person knowing or the person known
      is here affirmed to know.
    </p>
<p>
      'What one sees, that one sees: one sees a pillar: ergo, that one pillar
      sees.
    </p>
<p>
      'What you ARE holding, that you are: you are holding a stone: ergo, a
      stone you are.
    </p>
<p>
      'Is a speaking of the silent possible? "The silent" denotes either the
      speaker are the subject of speech.
    </p>
<p>
      'There are three kinds of ambiguity of term or proposition. The first is
      when there is an equal linguistic propriety in several interpretations;
      the second when one is improper but customary; the third when the
      ambiguity arises in the combination of elements that are in themselves
      unambiguous, as in "knowing letters." "Knowing" and "letters" are perhaps
      separately unambiguous, but in combination may imply either that the
      letters are known, or that they themselves have knowledge. Such are the
      modes in which propositions and terms may be ambiguous.'
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I do.
    </p>
<p>
      Then do you see our garments?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Then our garments have the quality of vision.
    </p>
<p>
      They can see to any extent, said Ctesippus.
    </p>
<p>
      What can they see?
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing; but you, my sweet man, may perhaps imagine that they do not see;
      and certainly, Euthydemus, you do seem to me to have been caught napping
      when you were not asleep, and that if it be possible to speak and say
      nothing—you are doing so.
    </p>
<p>
      And may there not be a silence of the speaker? said Dionysodorus.
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible, said Ctesippus.
    </p>
<p>
      Or a speaking of the silent?
    </p>
<p>
      That is still more impossible, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      But when you speak of stones, wood, iron bars, do you not speak of the
      silent?
    </p>
<p>
      Not when I pass a smithy; for then the iron bars make a tremendous noise
      and outcry if they are touched: so that here your wisdom is strangely
      mistaken; please, however, to tell me how you can be silent when speaking
      (I thought that Ctesippus was put upon his mettle because Cleinias was
      present).
    </p>
<p>
      When you are silent, said Euthydemus, is there not a silence of all
      things?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      But if speaking things are included in all things, then the speaking are
      silent.
    </p>
<p>
      What, said Ctesippus; then all things are not silent?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not, said Euthydemus.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, my good friend, do they all speak?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes; those which speak.
    </p>
<p>
      Nay, said Ctesippus, but the question which I ask is whether all things
      are silent or speak?
    </p>
<p>
      Neither and both, said Dionysodorus, quickly interposing; I am sure that
      you will be 'non-plussed' at that answer.
    </p>
<p>
      Here Ctesippus, as his manner was, burst into a roar of laughter; he said,
      That brother of yours, Euthydemus, has got into a dilemma; all is over
      with him. This delighted Cleinias, whose laughter made Ctesippus ten times
      as uproarious; but I cannot help thinking that the rogue must have picked
      up this answer from them; for there has been no wisdom like theirs in our
      time. Why do you laugh, Cleinias, I said, at such solemn and beautiful
      things?
    </p>
<p>
      Why, Socrates, said Dionysodorus, did you ever see a beautiful thing?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, Dionysodorus, I replied, I have seen many.
    </p>
<p>
      Were they other than the beautiful, or the same as the beautiful?
    </p>
<p>
      Now I was in a great quandary at having to answer this question, and I
      thought that I was rightly served for having opened my mouth at all: I
      said however, They are not the same as absolute beauty, but they have
      beauty present with each of them.
    </p>
<p>
      And are you an ox because an ox is present with you, or are you
      Dionysodorus, because Dionysodorus is present with you?
    </p>
<p>
      God forbid, I replied.
    </p>
<p>
      But how, he said, by reason of one thing being present with another, will
      one thing be another?
    </p>
<p>
      Is that your difficulty? I said. For I was beginning to imitate their
      skill, on which my heart was set.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course, he replied, I and all the world are in a difficulty about the
      non-existent.
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean, Dionysodorus? I said. Is not the honourable honourable
      and the base base?
    </p>
<p>
      That, he said, is as I please.
    </p>
<p>
      And do you please?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And you will admit that the same is the same, and the other other; for
      surely the other is not the same; I should imagine that even a child will
      hardly deny the other to be other. But I think, Dionysodorus, that you
      must have intentionally missed the last question; for in general you and
      your brother seem to me to be good workmen in your own department, and to
      do the dialectician's business excellently well.
    </p>
<p>
      What, said he, is the business of a good workman? tell me, in the first
      place, whose business is hammering?
    </p>
<p>
      The smith's.
    </p>
<p>
      And whose the making of pots?
    </p>
<p>
      The potter's.
    </p>
<p>
      And who has to kill and skin and mince and boil and roast?
    </p>
<p>
      The cook, I said.
    </p>
<p>
      And if a man does his business he does rightly?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And the business of the cook is to cut up and skin; you have admitted
      that?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I have admitted that, but you must not be too hard upon me.
    </p>
<p>
      Then if some one were to kill, mince, boil, roast the cook, he would do
      his business, and if he were to hammer the smith, and make a pot of the
      potter, he would do their business.
    </p>
<p>
      Poseidon, I said, this is the crown of wisdom; can I ever hope to have
      such wisdom of my own?
    </p>
<p>
      And would you be able, Socrates, to recognize this wisdom when it has
      become your own?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, I said, if you will allow me.
    </p>
<p>
      What, he said, do you think that you know what is your own?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I do, subject to your correction; for you are the bottom, and
      Euthydemus is the top, of all my wisdom.
    </p>
<p>
      Is not that which you would deem your own, he said, that which you have in
      your own power, and which you are able to use as you would desire, for
      example, an ox or a sheep—would you not think that which you could
      sell and give and sacrifice to any god whom you pleased, to be your own,
      and that which you could not give or sell or sacrifice you would think not
      to be in your own power?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said (for I was certain that something good would come out of the
      questions, which I was impatient to hear); yes, such things, and such
      things only are mine.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, and you would mean by animals living beings?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said.
    </p>
<p>
      You agree then, that those animals only are yours with which you have the
      power to do all these things which I was just naming?
    </p>
<p>
      I agree.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, after a pause, in which he seemed to be lost in the contemplation of
      something great, he said: Tell me, Socrates, have you an ancestral Zeus?
      Here, anticipating the final move, like a person caught in a net, who
      gives a desperate twist that he may get away, I said: No, Dionysodorus, I
      have not.
    </p>
<p>
      What a miserable man you must be then, he said; you are not an Athenian at
      all if you have no ancestral gods or temples, or any other mark of
      gentility.
    </p>
<p>
      Nay, Dionysodorus, I said, do not be rough; good words, if you please; in
      the way of religion I have altars and temples, domestic and ancestral, and
      all that other Athenians have.
    </p>
<p>
      And have not other Athenians, he said, an ancestral Zeus?
    </p>
<p>
      That name, I said, is not to be found among the Ionians, whether colonists
      or citizens of Athens; an ancestral Apollo there is, who is the father of
      Ion, and a family Zeus, and a Zeus guardian of the phratry, and an Athene
      guardian of the phratry. But the name of ancestral Zeus is unknown to us.
    </p>
<p>
      No matter, said Dionysodorus, for you admit that you have Apollo, Zeus,
      and Athene.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, I said.
    </p>
<p>
      And they are your gods, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, my lords and ancestors.
    </p>
<p>
      At any rate they are yours, he said, did you not admit that?
    </p>
<p>
      I did, I said; what is going to happen to me?
    </p>
<p>
      And are not these gods animals? for you admit that all things which have
      life are animals; and have not these gods life?
    </p>
<p>
      They have life, I said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then are they not animals?
    </p>
<p>
      They are animals, I said.
    </p>
<p>
      And you admitted that of animals those are yours which you could give away
      or sell or offer in sacrifice, as you pleased?
    </p>
<p>
      I did admit that, Euthydemus, and I have no way of escape.
    </p>
<p>
      Well then, said he, if you admit that Zeus and the other gods are yours,
      can you sell them or give them away or do what you will with them, as you
      would with other animals?
    </p>
<p>
      At this I was quite struck dumb, Crito, and lay prostrate. Ctesippus came
      to the rescue.
    </p>
<p>
      Bravo, Heracles, brave words, said he.
    </p>
<p>
      Bravo Heracles, or is Heracles a Bravo? said Dionysodorus.
    </p>
<p>
      Poseidon, said Ctesippus, what awful distinctions. I will have no more of
      them; the pair are invincible.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, my dear Crito, there was universal applause of the speakers and
      their words, and what with laughing and clapping of hands and rejoicings
      the two men were quite overpowered; for hitherto their partisans only had
      cheered at each successive hit, but now the whole company shouted with
      delight until the columns of the Lyceum returned the sound, seeming to
      sympathize in their joy. To such a pitch was I affected myself, that I
      made a speech, in which I acknowledged that I had never seen the like of
      their wisdom; I was their devoted servant, and fell to praising and
      admiring of them. What marvellous dexterity of wit, I said, enabled you to
      acquire this great perfection in such a short time? There is much, indeed,
      to admire in your words, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, but there is nothing
      that I admire more than your magnanimous disregard of any opinion—whether
      of the many, or of the grave and reverend seigniors—you regard only
      those who are like yourselves. And I do verily believe that there are few
      who are like you, and who would approve of such arguments; the majority of
      mankind are so ignorant of their value, that they would be more ashamed of
      employing them in the refutation of others than of being refuted by them.
      I must further express my approval of your kind and public-spirited denial
      of all differences, whether of good and evil, white or black, or any
      other; the result of which is that, as you say, every mouth is sewn up,
      not excepting your own, which graciously follows the example of others;
      and thus all ground of offence is taken away. But what appears to me to be
      more than all is, that this art and invention of yours has been so
      admirably contrived by you, that in a very short time it can be imparted
      to any one. I observed that Ctesippus learned to imitate you in no time.
      Now this quickness of attainment is an excellent thing; but at the same
      time I would advise you not to have any more public entertainments; there
      is a danger that men may undervalue an art which they have so easy an
      opportunity of acquiring; the exhibition would be best of all, if the
      discussion were confined to your two selves; but if there must be an
      audience, let him only be present who is willing to pay a handsome fee;—you
      should be careful of this;—and if you are wise, you will also bid
      your disciples discourse with no man but you and themselves. For only what
      is rare is valuable; and 'water,' which, as Pindar says, is the 'best of
      all things,' is also the cheapest. And now I have only to request that you
      will receive Cleinias and me among your pupils.
    </p>
<p>
      Such was the discussion, Crito; and after a few more words had passed
      between us we went away. I hope that you will come to them with me, since
      they say that they are able to teach any one who will give them money; no
      age or want of capacity is an impediment. And I must repeat one thing
      which they said, for your especial benefit,—that the learning of
      their art did not at all interfere with the business of money-making.
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: Truly, Socrates, though I am curious and ready to learn, yet I fear
      that I am not like-minded with Euthydemus, but one of the other sort, who,
      as you were saying, would rather be refuted by such arguments than use
      them in refutation of others. And though I may appear ridiculous in
      venturing to advise you, I think that you may as well hear what was said
      to me by a man of very considerable pretensions—he was a professor
      of legal oratory—who came away from you while I was walking up and
      down. 'Crito,' said he to me, 'are you giving no attention to these wise
      men?' 'No, indeed,' I said to him; 'I could not get within hearing of them—there
      was such a crowd.' 'You would have heard something worth hearing if you
      had.' 'What was that?' I said. 'You would have heard the greatest masters
      of the art of rhetoric discoursing.' 'And what did you think of them?' I
      said. 'What did I think of them?' he said:—'theirs was the sort of
      discourse which anybody might hear from men who were playing the fool, and
      making much ado about nothing.' That was the expression which he used.
      'Surely,' I said, 'philosophy is a charming thing.' 'Charming!' he said;
      'what simplicity! philosophy is nought; and I think that if you had been
      present you would have been ashamed of your friend—his conduct was
      so very strange in placing himself at the mercy of men who care not what
      they say, and fasten upon every word. And these, as I was telling you, are
      supposed to be the most eminent professors of their time. But the truth
      is, Crito, that the study itself and the men themselves are utterly mean
      and ridiculous.' Now censure of the pursuit, Socrates, whether coming from
      him or from others, appears to me to be undeserved; but as to the
      impropriety of holding a public discussion with such men, there, I confess
      that, in my opinion, he was in the right.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: O Crito, they are marvellous men; but what was I going to say?
      First of all let me know;—What manner of man was he who came up to
      you and censured philosophy; was he an orator who himself practises in the
      courts, or an instructor of orators, who makes the speeches with which
      they do battle?
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: He was certainly not an orator, and I doubt whether he had ever
      been into court; but they say that he knows the business, and is a clever
      man, and composes wonderful speeches.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Now I understand, Crito; he is one of an amphibious class, whom
      I was on the point of mentioning—one of those whom Prodicus
      describes as on the border-ground between philosophers and statesmen—they
      think that they are the wisest of all men, and that they are generally
      esteemed the wisest; nothing but the rivalry of the philosophers stands in
      their way; and they are of the opinion that if they can prove the
      philosophers to be good for nothing, no one will dispute their title to
      the palm of wisdom, for that they are themselves really the wisest,
      although they are apt to be mauled by Euthydemus and his friends, when
      they get hold of them in conversation. This opinion which they entertain
      of their own wisdom is very natural; for they have a certain amount of
      philosophy, and a certain amount of political wisdom; there is reason in
      what they say, for they argue that they have just enough of both, and so
      they keep out of the way of all risks and conflicts and reap the fruits of
      their wisdom.
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: What do you say of them, Socrates? There is certainly something
      specious in that notion of theirs.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Yes, Crito, there is more speciousness than truth; they cannot
      be made to understand the nature of intermediates. For all persons or
      things, which are intermediate between two other things, and participate
      in both of them—if one of these two things is good and the other
      evil, are better than the one and worse than the other; but if they are in
      a mean between two good things which do not tend to the same end, they
      fall short of either of their component elements in the attainment of
      their ends. Only in the case when the two component elements which do not
      tend to the same end are evil is the participant better than either. Now,
      if philosophy and political action are both good, but tend to different
      ends, and they participate in both, and are in a mean between them, then
      they are talking nonsense, for they are worse than either; or, if the one
      be good and the other evil, they are better than the one and worse than
      the other; only on the supposition that they are both evil could there be
      any truth in what they say. I do not think that they will admit that their
      two pursuits are either wholly or partly evil; but the truth is, that
      these philosopher-politicians who aim at both fall short of both in the
      attainment of their respective ends, and are really third, although they
      would like to stand first. There is no need, however, to be angry at this
      ambition of theirs—which may be forgiven; for every man ought to be
      loved who says and manfully pursues and works out anything which is at all
      like wisdom: at the same time we shall do well to see them as they really
      are.
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: I have often told you, Socrates, that I am in a constant difficulty
      about my two sons. What am I to do with them? There is no hurry about the
      younger one, who is only a child; but the other, Critobulus, is getting
      on, and needs some one who will improve him. I cannot help thinking, when
      I hear you talk, that there is a sort of madness in many of our anxieties
      about our children:—in the first place, about marrying a wife of
      good family to be the mother of them, and then about heaping up money for
      them—and yet taking no care about their education. But then again,
      when I contemplate any of those who pretend to educate others, I am
      amazed. To me, if I am to confess the truth, they all seem to be such
      outrageous beings: so that I do not know how I can advise the youth to
      study philosophy.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Dear Crito, do you not know that in every profession the
      inferior sort are numerous and good for nothing, and the good are few and
      beyond all price: for example, are not gymnastic and rhetoric and
      money-making and the art of the general, noble arts?
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: Certainly they are, in my judgment.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Well, and do you not see that in each of these arts the many are
      ridiculous performers?
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: Yes, indeed, that is very true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And will you on this account shun all these pursuits yourself
      and refuse to allow them to your son?
    </p>
<p>
      CRITO: That would not be reasonable, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Do you then be reasonable, Crito, and do not mind whether the
      teachers of philosophy are good or bad, but think only of philosophy
      herself. Try and examine her well and truly, and if she be evil seek to
      turn away all men from her, and not your sons only; but if she be what I
      believe that she is, then follow her and serve her, you and your house, as
      the saying is, and be of good cheer.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
