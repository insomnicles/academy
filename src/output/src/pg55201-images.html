<p class="center">Transcriber’s Note and List of Contents</p>
<p>Several editions of Jowett’s translation of Plato’s <i>Republic</i> were published in his lifetime, and many since. This text attempts to capture all that is of value in the early versions. It is based largely on the third edition, “revised and corrected throughout,” of 1888, but incorporating the complete Stephanus numbering that is found only in a two-volume version published in 1908. Sources gratefully exploited include an earlier Project Gutenberg version (#1497), an html version at the Online Library of Liberty, the Internet Archive (file of the 1888 edition: <a href="https://archive.org/details/a604578400platuoft" id="id-3542971587587508589">a604578400platuoft.pdf</a>; volume 1 of the 1908 edition, <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.223394" id="id-5266017733723361363">in.ernet.dli.2015.223394</a>, volume 2, <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.223395" id="id-3981064719358457671">in.ernet.dli.2015.223395</a>), reference material at Distributed Proofreaders, and Wikimedia Commons.</p>
<p>Page numbers for the 1888 edition are given in-text printed in red. Stephanus numbers are given in the right margin. Sidenotes are given in the left margin. Things may be different on a small width screen: sidenotes and page numbers are removed, the Stephanus numbers are included in the body of the text in green. This means that most, but not all, internal cross-references should still work.</p>
<p>The 1888 edition does not have a Table of Contents. The following listing provides hyperlinks to distinct sections of the work.</p>

<h2 class="space-above" id="pref">PREFACE.</h2>
<p>I<span class="smcap">N</span> publishing a third edition of the Republic of Plato (originally included in my edition of Plato’s works), I have to acknowledge the assistance of several friends, especially of my secretary, Mr. Matthew Knight, now residing for his health at Davôs, and of Mr. Frank Fletcher, Exhibitioner of Balliol College. To their accuracy and scholarship I am under great obligations. The excellent index, in which are contained references to other dialogues as well as to the Republic, is entirely the work of Mr. Knight. I am also considerably indebted to Mr. J. W. MacKail, Fellow of Balliol College, who read over the whole book in the previous edition, and noted several inaccuracies.</p>
<p>The additions and alterations both in the introduction and in the text, affect at least a third of the work.</p>
<p>Having regard to the extent of these alterations, and to the annoyance which is felt by the owner of a book at the possession of it in an inferior form, and still more keenly by the writer himself, who must always desire to be read as he is at his best, I have thought that some persons might like to exchange for the new edition the separate edition of the Republic published in 1881, to which this present volume is the successor. I have therefore arranged that those who desire to make this exchange, on depositing a perfect copy of the former separate edition with any agent of the Clarendon Press, shall be entitled to receive the new edition at half-price.</p>
<p>It is my hope to issue a revised edition of the remaining Dialogues in the course of a year.</p>

      T<span class="smcap">HE</span> Republic of Plato is the longest of his works with the exception of
      the Laws, and is certainly the greatest of them. There are nearer
      approaches to modern metaphysics in the Philebus and in the Sophist; the
      Politicus or Statesman is more ideal; the form and institutions of the
      State are more clearly drawn out in the Laws; as works of art, the
      Symposium and the Protagoras are of higher excellence. But no other
      Dialogue of Plato has the same largeness of view and the same perfection
      of style; no other shows an equal knowledge of the world, or contains more
      of those thoughts which are new as well as old, and not of one age only
      but of all. Nowhere in Plato is there a deeper irony or a greater wealth
      of humour or imagery, or more dramatic power. Nor in any other of his
      writings is the attempt made to interweave life and speculation, or to
      connect politics with philosophy. The Republic is the centre around which
      the other Dialogues may be grouped; here philosophy reaches the highest
      point (cp. especially in Books <a href="#BookV" class="pginternal">V</a>, <a href="#BookVI" class="pginternal">VI</a>, <a href="#BookVII" class="pginternal">VII</a>) to which ancient thinkers ever
      attained. Plato among the Greeks, like Bacon among the moderns, was the
      first who conceived a method of knowledge, although neither of them always
      distinguished the bare outline or form from the substance of truth; and
      both of them had to be content with an abstraction of science which was
      not yet realized. He was the greatest metaphysical genius whom the world
      has seen; and in him, more than in any other ancient thinker, the germs of
      future knowledge are contained. The sciences of logic and psychology,
      which have supplied so many instruments of thought to after-ages, are
      based upon the analyses of Socrates and Plato. The principles of
      definition, the law of contradiction, the fallacy of arguing in a circle,
      the distinction between the  essence and accidents of a thing or notion,
      between means and ends, between causes and conditions; also the division
      of the mind into the rational, concupiscent, and irascible elements, or of
      pleasures and desires into necessary and unnecessary—these <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageii"></a>ii</span> and other
      great forms of thought are all of them to be found in the Republic, and
      were probably first invented by Plato. The greatest of all logical truths,
      and the one of which writers on philosophy are most apt to lose sight, the
      difference between words and things, has been most strenuously insisted on
      by him (cp. Rep. <a href="#stpage454A" class="pginternal">454 A</a>; Polit. 261 E; Cratyl. 435, 436 ff.), although he has not always avoided the
      confusion of them in his own writings (e.g. Rep. <a href="#stpage463E" class="pginternal">463 E</a>). But he does not bind up
      truth in logical formulae,—logic is still veiled in metaphysics; and
      the science which he imagines to ‘contemplate all truth and all existence’
      is very unlike the doctrine of the syllogism which Aristotle claims to
      have discovered (Soph. Elenchi 33. 18).
    </p>
<p>
      Neither must we forget that the Republic is but the third part of a still
      larger design which was to have included an ideal history of Athens, as
      well as a political and physical philosophy. The fragment of the Critias
      has given birth to a world-famous fiction, second only in importance to
      the tale of Troy and the legend of Arthur; and is said as a fact to have
      inspired some of the early navigators of the sixteenth century. This
      mythical tale, of which the subject was a history of the wars of the
      Athenians against the Island of Atlantis, is supposed to be founded upon
      an unfinished poem of Solon, to which it would have stood in the same
      relation as the writings of the logographers to the poems of Homer. It
      would have told of a struggle for Liberty (cp. Tim. 25 C), intended to
      represent the conflict of Persia and Hellas. We may judge from the noble
      commencement of the Timaeus, from the fragment of the Critias itself, and
      from the third book of the Laws, in what manner Plato would have treated
      this high argument. We can only guess why the great design was abandoned;
      perhaps because Plato became sensible of some incongruity in a fictitious
      history, or because he had lost his interest in it, or because advancing
      years forbade the completion of it; and we may please ourselves with the
      fancy that had this imaginary narrative ever been finished, we should have
      found Plato himself sympathising with the struggle for Hellenic
      independence (cp. Laws iii. 698 ff.), singing a hymn of triumph over Marathon and
      Salamis, perhaps making the reflection of Herodotus where he contemplates
      the growth of the Athenian empire—‘How brave a thing is freedom of
      speech, <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageiii"></a>iii</span> which has made the Athenians so far exceed every other state of
      Hellas in greatness!’ or, more probably, attributing the victory to the
      ancient good order of Athens and to the favour of Apollo and Athene (cp.
      Introd. to Critias).
    </p>
<p>
      Again, Plato may be regarded as the ‘captain’ (<span class="transl" title="a)rchêgo/s">ἀρχηγός</span>) or leader of a
      goodly band of followers; for in the Republic is to be found the original
      of Cicero’s De Republica, of St. Augustine’s City of God, of the Utopia of
      Sir Thomas More, and of the numerous other imaginary States which are
      framed upon the same model. The extent to which Aristotle or the
      Aristotelian school were indebted to him in the Politics has been little
      recognised, and the recognition is the more necessary because it is not
      made by Aristotle himself. The two philosophers had more in common than
      they were conscious of; and probably some elements of Plato remain still
      undetected in Aristotle. In English philosophy too, many affinities may be
      traced, not only in the works of the Cambridge Platonists, but in great
      original writers like Berkeley or Coleridge, to Plato and his ideas. That
      there is a truth higher than experience, of which the mind bears witness
      to herself, is a conviction which in our own generation has been
      enthusiastically asserted, and is perhaps gaining ground. Of the Greek
      authors who at the Renaissance brought a new life into the world Plato has
      had the greatest influence. The Republic of Plato is also the first
      treatise upon education, of which the writings of Milton and Locke,
      Rousseau, Jean Paul, and Goethe are the legitimate descendants. Like Dante
      or Bunyan, he has a revelation of another  life; like Bacon, he is
      profoundly impressed with the unity of knowledge; in the early Church he
      exercised a real influence on theology, and at the Revival of Literature
      on politics. Even the fragments of his words when ‘repeated at
      second-hand’ (Symp. 215 D) have in all ages ravished the hearts of men, who have
      seen reflected in them their own higher nature. He is the father of
      idealism in philosophy, in politics, in literature. And many of the latest
      conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen, such as the unity of
      knowledge, the reign of law, and the equality of the sexes, have been
      anticipated in a dream by him.
    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
      The argument of the Republic is the search after Justice, the nature of
      which is first hinted at by Cephalus, the just and blameless <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageiv"></a>iv</span> old man—then
      discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by Socrates and Polemarchus—then
      caricatured by Thrasymachus and partially explained by Socrates—reduced
      to an abstraction by Glaucon and Adeimantus, and having become invisible
      in the individual reappears at length in the ideal State which is
      constructed by Socrates. The first care of the rulers is to be education,
      of which an outline is drawn after the old Hellenic model, providing only
      for an improved religion and morality, and more simplicity in music and
      gymnastic, a manlier strain of poetry, and greater harmony of the
      individual and the State. We are thus led on to the conception of a higher
      State, in which ‘no man calls anything his own,’ and in which there is
      neither ‘marrying nor giving in marriage,’ and ‘kings are philosophers’
      and ‘philosophers are kings;’ and there is another and higher education,
      intellectual as well as moral and religious, of science as well as of art,
      and not of youth only but of the whole of life. Such a State is hardly to
      be realized in this world and quickly degenerates. To the perfect ideal
      succeeds the government of the soldier and the lover of honour, this again
      declining into democracy, and democracy into tyranny, in an imaginary but
      regular order having not much resemblance to the actual facts. When ‘the
      wheel has come full circle’ we do not begin again with a new period of
      human  life; but we have passed from the best to the worst, and there we
      end. The subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry and
      philosophy which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books of the
      Republic is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion. Poetry is
      discovered to be an imitation thrice removed from the truth, and Homer, as
      well as the dramatic poets, having been condemned as an imitator, is sent
      into banishment along with them. And the idea of the State is supplemented
      by the revelation of a future life.
    </p>
<p>
      The division into books, like all similar divisions,<a href="#Footnoteintro1" id="FnAnchorintro1" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">1</span></a> is probably later than the age of Plato. The
      natural divisions are five in number;—(1) Book I and the first half
      of Book II down to the paragraph beginning, ‘I had always admired the
      genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus,’ which is introductory; the first book
      containing a refutation of the popular and sophistical notions of justice,
      and concluding, like some of the earlier Dialogues, without arriving at
      any definite result. To this is appended a restatement of the nature of
      justice <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagev"></a>v</span> according to common opinion, and an answer is demanded to the
      question—What is justice, stripped of appearances? The second
      division (2) includes the remainder of the second and the whole of the
      third and fourth books, which are mainly occupied with the construction of
      the first State and the first education. The third division (3) consists
      of the fifth, sixth, and seventh books, in which philosophy rather than
      justice is the subject of enquiry, and the second State is constructed on
      principles of communism and ruled by philosophers, and the contemplation
      of the idea of good takes the place of the social and political virtues.
      In the eighth and ninth books (4) the perversions of States and of the
      individuals who correspond to them are reviewed in succession; and the
      nature of pleasure and the principle of tyranny are further analysed in
      the individual man. The tenth book (5) is the conclusion of the whole, in
      which the relations of philosophy to poetry are finally determined, and
      the happiness of the citizens in this life, which has now been assured, is
      crowned by the vision of another.
    </p>

<p>
       Or a more general division into two parts may be adopted; the first (Books
      I–IV) containing the description of a State framed generally in
      accordance with Hellenic notions of religion and morality, while in the
      second (Books V–X) the Hellenic State is transformed into an ideal
      kingdom of philosophy, of which all other governments are the perversions.
      These two points of view are really opposed, and the opposition is only
      veiled by the genius of Plato. The Republic, like the Phaedrus (see
      Introduction to Phaedrus), is an imperfect whole; the higher light of
      philosophy breaks through the regularity of the Hellenic temple, which at
      last fades away into the heavens (<a href="#stpage592B" class="pginternal">592 B</a>). Whether this imperfection of structure
      arises from an enlargement of the plan; or from the imperfect
      reconcilement in the writer’s own mind of the struggling elements of
      thought which are now first brought together by him; or, perhaps, from the
      composition of the work at different times—are questions, like the
      similar question about the Iliad and the Odyssey, which are worth asking,
      but which cannot have a distinct answer. In the age of Plato there was no
      regular mode of publication, and an author would have the less scruple in
      altering or adding to a work which was known only to a few of his friends.
      There is no absurdity in supposing that he may have laid his labours aside
      for a time, or turned from one work to <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevi"></a>vi</span> another; and such interruptions
      would be more likely to occur in the case of a long than of a short
      writing. In all attempts to determine the chronological order of the
      Platonic writings on internal evidence, this uncertainty about any single
      Dialogue being composed at one time is a disturbing element, which must be
      admitted to affect longer works, such as the Republic and the Laws, more
      than shorter ones. But, on the other hand, the seeming discrepancies of
      the Republic may only arise out of the discordant elements which the
      philosopher has attempted to unite in a single whole, perhaps without
      being himself able to recognise the inconsistency which is obvious to us.
      For there is a judgment of after ages which few great writers have ever
      been able to anticipate for themselves. They do not perceive the want of
      connexion in their own writings, or the gaps in their systems which are
      visible enough to those who come after them. In the beginnings of
      literature and philosophy, amid the first efforts of thought and language,
      more inconsistencies occur than now, when the paths of speculation are
      well worn and the meaning of words precisely defined. For consistency,
      too, is the growth of time; and some of the greatest creations of the
      human mind have been wanting in unity. Tried by this test, several of the
      Platonic Dialogues, according to our modern ideas, appear to be defective,
      but the deficiency is no proof that they were composed at different times
      or by different hands. And the supposition that the Republic was written
      uninterruptedly and by a continuous effort is in some degree confirmed by
      the numerous references from one part of the work to another.
    </p>
<p>
      The second title, ‘Concerning Justice,’ is not the one by which the
      Republic is quoted, either by Aristotle or generally in antiquity, and,
      like the other second titles of the Platonic Dialogues, may therefore be
      assumed to be of later date. Morgenstern and others have asked whether the
      definition of justice, which is the professed aim, or the construction of
      the State is the principal argument of the work. The answer is, that the
      two blend in one, and are two faces of the same truth; for justice is the
      order of the State, and the State is the visible embodiment of justice
      under the conditions of human society. The one is the soul and the other
      is the body, and the Greek ideal of the State, as of the individual, is a
      fair mind in a fair body. In Hegelian phraseology the state is the reality
      of <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevii"></a>vii</span> which justice is the idea. Or, described in Christian language, the
      kingdom of God is within, and yet developes into a Church or external
      kingdom; ‘the house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,’ is
      reduced to the proportions of an earthly building. Or, to use a Platonic
      image, justice and the State are the warp and the woof which run through
      the whole texture. And when the constitution of the State is completed,
      the conception of justice  is not dismissed, but reappears under the same
      or different names throughout the work, both as the inner law of the
      individual soul, and finally as the principle of rewards and punishments
      in another life. The virtues are based on justice, of which common honesty
      in buying and selling is the shadow, and justice is based on the idea of
      good, which is the harmony of the world, and is reflected both in the
      institutions of states and in motions of the heavenly bodies (cp. Tim. 47).
      The Timaeus, which takes up the political rather than the ethical side of
      the Republic, and is chiefly occupied with hypotheses concerning the
      outward world, yet contains many indications that the same law is supposed
      to reign over the State, over nature, and over man.
    </p>
<p>
      Too much, however, has been made of this question both in ancient and
      modern times. There is a stage of criticism in which all works, whether of
      nature or of art, are referred to design. Now in ancient writings, and
      indeed in literature generally, there remains often a large element which
      was not comprehended in the original design. For the plan grows under the
      author’s hand; new thoughts occur to him in the act of writing; he has not
      worked out the argument to the end before he begins. The reader who seeks
      to find some one idea under which the whole may be conceived, must
      necessarily seize on the vaguest and most general. Thus Stallbaum, who is
      dissatisfied with the ordinary explanations of the argument of the
      Republic, imagines himself to have found the true argument ‘in the
      representation of human life in a State perfected by justice, and governed
      according to the idea of good.’ There may be some use in such general
      descriptions, but they can hardly be said to express the design of the
      writer. The truth is, that we may as well speak of many designs as of one;
      nor need anything be excluded from the plan of a great work to which the
      mind is naturally led by the association of ideas, and which does not
      interfere with the general purpose. What kind or degree of <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageviii"></a>viii</span> unity is to be
      sought after in a building, in the plastic arts, in poetry, in prose, is a
      problem which has to be determined  relatively to the subject-matter. To
      Plato himself, the enquiry ‘what was the intention of the writer,’ or
      ‘what was the principal argument of the Republic’ would have been hardly
      intelligible, and therefore had better be at once dismissed (cp. the
      Introduction to the Phaedrus, vol. i.).
    </p>
<p>
      Is not the Republic the vehicle of three or four great truths which, to
      Plato’s own mind, are most naturally represented in the form of the State?
      Just as in the Jewish prophets the reign of Messiah, or ‘the day of the
      Lord,’ or the suffering Servant or people of God, or the ‘Sun of
      righteousness with healing in his wings’ only convey, to us at least,
      their great spiritual ideals, so through the Greek State Plato reveals to
      us his own thoughts about divine perfection, which is the idea of good—like
      the sun in the visible world;—about human perfection, which is
      justice—about education beginning in youth and continuing in later
      years—about poets and sophists and tyrants who are the false
      teachers and evil rulers of mankind—about ‘the world’ which is the
      embodiment of them—about a kingdom which exists nowhere upon earth
      but is laid up in heaven to be the pattern and rule of human life. No such
      inspired creation is at unity with itself, any more than the clouds of
      heaven when the sun pierces through them. Every shade of light and dark,
      of truth, and of fiction which is the veil of truth, is allowable in a
      work of philosophical imagination. It is not all on the same plane; it
      easily passes from ideas to myths and fancies, from facts to figures of
      speech. It is not prose but poetry, at least a great part of it, and ought
      not to be judged by the rules of logic or the probabilities of history.
      The writer is not fashioning his ideas into an artistic whole; they take
      possession of him and are too much for him. We have no need therefore to
      discuss whether a State such as Plato has conceived is practicable or not,
      or whether the outward form or the inward life came first into the mind of
      the writer. For the practicability of his ideas has nothing to do with
      their truth (v. <a href="#stpage472D" class="pginternal">472 D</a>); and the highest thoughts to which he attains may be truly
      said to bear the greatest ‘marks of design’—justice more  than the
      external frame-work of the State, the idea of good more than justice. The
      great science of dialectic or the organisation of ideas has no real
      content; but is only a type of the method or <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageix"></a>ix</span> spirit in which the higher
      knowledge is to be pursued by the spectator of all time and all existence.
      It is in the fifth, sixth, and seventh books that Plato reaches the
      ‘summit of speculation,’ and these, although they fail to satisfy the
      requirements of a modern thinker, may therefore be regarded as the most
      important, as they are also the most original, portions of the work.
    </p>
<p>
      It is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question which has been
      raised by Boeckh, respecting the imaginary date at which the conversation
      was held (the year 411 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> which is proposed by him will do as well as
      any other); for a writer of fiction, and especially a writer who, like
      Plato, is notoriously careless of chronology (cp. Rep. i. <a href="#stpage336A" class="pginternal">336</a>, Symp. 193 A, etc.), only
      aims at general probability. Whether all the persons mentioned in the
      Republic could ever have met at any one time is not a difficulty which
      would have occurred to an Athenian reading the work forty years later, or
      to Plato himself at the time of writing (any more than to Shakespeare
      respecting one of his own dramas); and need not greatly trouble us now.
      Yet this may be a question having no answer ‘which is still worth asking,’
      because the investigation shows that we cannot argue historically from the
      dates in Plato; it would be useless therefore to waste time in inventing
      far-fetched reconcilements of them in order to avoid chronological
      difficulties, such, for example, as the conjecture of C. F. Hermann, that
      Glaucon and Adeimantus are not the brothers but the uncles of Plato (cp.
      Apol. 34 A), or the fancy of Stallbaum that Plato intentionally left
      anachronisms indicating the dates at which some of his Dialogues were
      written.
    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
      The principal characters in the Republic are Cephalus, Polemarchus,
      Thrasymachus, Socrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus. Cephalus appears in the
      introduction only, Polemarchus drops at the end of the first argument, and
      Thrasymachus is reduced to silence at the close of the first book. The
      main discussion is carried on by Socrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus. Among
      the company are Lysias (the orator) and Euthydemus, the sons of Cephalus
      and brothers of Polemarchus, an unknown Charmantides—these are mute
      auditors; also there is Cleitophon, who once interrupts (<a href="#stpage340A" class="pginternal">340 A</a>), where, as in the
      Dialogue which bears his name, he appears as the friend and ally of
      Thrasymachus.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagex"></a>x</span> Cephalus, the patriarch of the house, has been appropriately engaged in
      offering a sacrifice. He is the pattern of an old man who has almost done
      with life, and is at peace with himself and with all mankind. He feels
      that he is drawing nearer to the world below, and seems to linger around
      the memory of the past. He is eager that Socrates should come to visit
      him, fond of the poetry of the last generation, happy in the consciousness
      of a well-spent life, glad at having escaped from the tyranny of youthful
      lusts. His love of conversation, his affection, his indifference to
      riches, even his garrulity, are interesting traits of character. He is not
      one of those who have nothing to say, because their whole mind has been
      absorbed in making money. Yet he acknowledges that riches have the
      advantage of placing men above the temptation to dishonesty or falsehood.
      The respectful attention shown to him by Socrates, whose love of
      conversation, no less than the mission imposed upon him by the Oracle,
      leads him to ask questions of all men, young and old alike (cp. i. <a href="#stpage328A" class="pginternal">328 A</a>), should also be
      noted. Who better suited to raise the question of justice than Cephalus,
      whose life might seem to be the expression of it? The moderation with
      which old age is pictured by Cephalus as a very tolerable portion of
      existence is characteristic, not only of him, but of Greek feeling
      generally, and contrasts with the exaggeration of Cicero in the De
      Senectute. The evening of life is described by Plato in the most
      expressive manner, yet with the fewest possible touches. As Cicero remarks
      (Ep. ad Attic. iv. 16), the aged Cephalus would have been out of
place in the discussion which follows, and which he could neither have
understood  nor taken part in without a violation of dramatic propriety
(cp. Lysimachus in the Laches, 89).
    </p>
<p>
      His ‘son and heir’ Polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousness of
      youth; he is for detaining Socrates by force in the opening scene, and
      will not ‘let him off’ (v. <a href="#stpage449B" class="pginternal">449 B</a>) on the subject of women and children. Like
      Cephalus, he is limited in his point of view, and represents the
      proverbial stage of morality which has rules of life rather than
      principles; and he quotes Simonides (cp. Aristoph. Clouds, 1355 ff.) as his father
      had quoted Pindar. But after this he has no more to say; the answers which
      he makes are only elicited from him by the dialectic of Socrates. He has
      not yet experienced the influence of the Sophists like Glaucon and
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexi"></a>xi</span> Adeimantus, nor is he sensible of the necessity of refuting them; he
      belongs to the pre-Socratic or pre-dialectical age. He is incapable of
      arguing, and is bewildered by Socrates to such a degree that he does not
      know what he is saying. He is made to admit that justice is a thief, and
      that the virtues follow the analogy of the arts (i. <a href="#stpage333E" class="pginternal">333 E</a>). From his brother Lysias
      (contra Eratosth. p. 121) we learn that he fell a victim to the Thirty Tyrants,
      but no allusion is here made to his fate, nor to the circumstance that
      Cephalus and his family were of Syracusan origin, and had migrated from
      Thurii to Athens.
    </p>
<p>
      The ‘Chalcedonian giant,’ Thrasymachus, of whom we have already heard in
      the Phaedrus (267 D), is the personification of the Sophists, according to Plato’s
      conception of them, in some of their worst characteristics. He is vain and
      blustering, refusing to discourse unless he is paid, fond of making an
      oration, and hoping thereby to escape the inevitable Socrates; but a mere
      child in argument, and unable to foresee that the next ‘move’ (to use a
      Platonic expression) will ‘shut him up’ (vi. <a href="#stpage487B" class="pginternal">487 B</a>). He has reached the stage of
      framing general notions, and in this respect is in advance of Cephalus and
      Polemarchus. But he is incapable of defending them in a discussion, and
      vainly tries to cover his confusion with banter and insolence. Whether
      such doctrines as are attributed to him by Plato were really held either
      by him  or by any other Sophist is uncertain; in the infancy of philosophy
      serious errors about morality might easily grow up—they are
      certainly put into the mouths of speakers in Thucydides; but we are
      concerned at present with Plato’s description of him, and not with the
      historical reality. The inequality of the contest adds greatly to the
      humour of the scene. The pompous and empty Sophist is utterly helpless in
      the hands of the great master of dialectic, who knows how to touch all the
      springs of vanity and weakness in him. He is greatly irritated by the
      irony of Socrates, but his noisy and imbecile rage only lays him more and
      more open to the thrusts of his assailant. His determination to cram down
      their throats, or put ‘bodily into their souls’ his own words, elicits a
      cry of horror from Socrates. The state of his temper is quite as worthy of
      remark as the process of the argument. Nothing is more amusing than his
      complete submission when he has been once thoroughly beaten. At first he
      seems to continue <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexii"></a>xii</span> the discussion with reluctance, but soon with apparent
      good-will, and he even testifies his interest at a later stage by one or
      two occasional remarks (v. <a href="#stpage450A" class="pginternal">450 A</a>, <a href="#stpage450B" class="pginternal">B</a>). When attacked by Glaucon (vi. <a href="#stpage489C" class="pginternal">489 C</a>, <a href="#stpage489D" class="pginternal">D</a>) he is humorously
      protected by Socrates ‘as one who has never been his enemy and is now his
      friend.’ From Cicero and Quintilian and from Aristotle’s Rhetoric (iii. i. 7; ii. 23, 29) we learn
      that the Sophist whom Plato has made so ridiculous was a man of note whose
      writings were preserved in later ages. The play on his name which was made
      by his contemporary Herodicus (Aris. Rhet. ii. 23, 29), ‘thou wast ever bold in
      battle,’ seems to show that the description of him is not devoid of
      verisimilitude.
    </p>
<p>
      When Thrasymachus has been silenced, the two principal respondents,
Glaucon and Adeimantus, appear on the scene: here, as in Greek tragedy
(cp. Introd. to Phaedo), three actors are introduced. At first sight
the two sons of Ariston may seem to wear a family likeness, like the two
friends Simmias and Cebes in the Phaedo. But on a nearer examination
of them the similarity vanishes, and they are seen to be distinct
characters. Glaucon is the impetuous youth who can ‘just  never have
enough of fechting’ (cp. the character of him in Xen. Mem. iii. 6);
the man of pleasure who is acquainted with the mysteries of love (v. <a href="#stpage474D" class="pginternal">474
D</a>); the ‘juvenis qui gaudet canibus,’ and who improves the breed of
animals (v. <a href="#stpage459A" class="pginternal">459 A</a>); the lover of art and music (iii. <a href="#stpage398D" class="pginternal">398 D</a>,  <a href="#stpage398E" class="pginternal">E</a>) who has
all the experiences of youthful life. He is full of quickness and
penetration, piercing easily below the clumsy platitudes of Thrasymachus
to the real difficulty; he turns out to the light the seamy side of human
life, and yet does not lose faith in the just and true. It is Glaucon who
seizes what may be termed the ludicrous relation of the philosopher to the
world, to whom a state of simplicity is ‘a city of pigs,’ who is always
prepared with a jest (iii. <a href="#stpage398C" class="pginternal">398 C</a>, <a href="#stpage407A" class="pginternal">407 A</a>; v. <a href="#stpage450A" class="pginternal">450</a>, <a href="#stpage451A" class="pginternal">451</a>, <a href="#stpage468C" class="pginternal">468 C</a>; vi. <a href="#stpage509C" class="pginternal">509 C</a>;
ix. <a href="#stpage586A" class="pginternal">586</a>) when the argument offers him an opportunity, and who is ever
ready to second the humour of Socrates and to appreciate the ridiculous,
whether in the connoisseurs of music (vii. <a href="#stpage531A" class="pginternal">531 A</a>), or in the lovers of
theatricals (v. <a href="#stpage475D" class="pginternal">475 D</a>), or in the fantastic behaviour of the citizens of
democracy (viii. <a href="#stpage557A" class="pginternal">557</a> foll.). His weaknesses are several times alluded to
by Socrates (iii. <a href="#stpage402E" class="pginternal">402 E</a>; v. <a href="#stpage474D" class="pginternal">474 D</a>, <a href="#stpage475E" class="pginternal">475 E</a>), who, however, will not allow
him to be attacked by his brother Adeimantus (viii. <a href="#stpage548D" class="pginternal">548 D</a>, <a href="#stpage548E" class="pginternal">E</a>). He is a
soldier, and, like Adeimantus, has been <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexiii"></a>xiii</span> distinguished at the battle of
Megara (<a href="#stpage368A" class="pginternal">368 A</a>, anno 456?)… The character of Adeimantus is deeper and
graver, and the profounder objections are commonly put into his mouth.
Glaucon is more demonstrative, and generally opens the game. Adeimantus
pursues the argument further. Glaucon has more of the liveliness and
quick sympathy of youth; Adeimantus has the maturer judgment of a grown-up
man of the world. In the second book, when Glaucon insists that justice
and injustice shall be considered without regard to their consequences,
Adeimantus remarks that they are regarded by mankind in general only for
the sake of their consequences; and in a similar vein of reflection he
urges at the beginning of the fourth book that Socrates fails in making
his citizens happy, and is answered that happiness is not the first but
the second thing,  not the direct aim but the indirect consequence of
the good government of a State. In the discussion about religion and
mythology, Adeimantus is the respondent (iii. <a href="#stpage376A" class="pginternal">376</a>-398), but Glaucon breaks
in with a slight jest, and carries on the conversation in a lighter tone
about music and gymnastic to the end of the book. It is Adeimantus again
who volunteers the criticism of common sense on the Socratic method of
argument (vi. <a href="#stpage487B" class="pginternal">487 B</a>), and who refuses to let Socrates pass lightly over
the question of women and children (v. <a href="#stpage449A" class="pginternal">449</a>). It is Adeimantus who is the
respondent in the more argumentative, as Glaucon in the lighter and more
imaginative portions of the Dialogue. For example, throughout the greater
part of the sixth book, the causes of the corruption of philosophy and the
conception of the idea of good are discussed with Adeimantus. At p. <a href="#stpage506C" class="pginternal">506 C</a>,
Glaucon resumes his place of principal respondent; but he has a difficulty
in apprehending the higher education of Socrates, and makes some false hits
in the course of the discussion (<a href="#stpage526D" class="pginternal">526 D</a>, <a href="#stpage527D" class="pginternal">527 D</a>). Once more Adeimantus
returns (viii. <a href="#stpage548A" class="pginternal">548</a>) with the allusion to his brother Glaucon whom he
compares to the contentious State; in the next book (ix. <a href="#stpage576A" class="pginternal">576</a>) he is again
superseded, and Glaucon continues to the end (x. <a href="#stpage621B" class="pginternal">621 B</a>).
    </p>
<p>
      Thus in a succession of characters Plato represents the successive stages
      of morality, beginning with the Athenian gentleman of the olden time, who
      is followed by the practical man of that day regulating his life by
      proverbs and saws; to him succeeds the wild generalization of the
      Sophists, and lastly come the young disciples of the great teacher, who
      know the sophistical arguments <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexiv"></a>xiv</span> but will not be convinced by them, and
      desire to go deeper into the nature of things. These too, like Cephalus,
      Polemarchus, Thrasymachus, are clearly distinguished from one another.
      Neither in the Republic, nor in any other Dialogue of Plato, is a single
      character repeated.
    </p>
<p>
      The delineation of Socrates in the Republic is not wholly consistent. In
the first book we have more of the real Socrates, such as he is depicted
in the Memorabilia of Xenophon,  in the earliest Dialogues of Plato,
and in the Apology. He is ironical, provoking, questioning, the old enemy
of the Sophists, ready to put on the mask of Silenus as well as to argue
seriously. But in the sixth book his enmity towards the Sophists abates;
he acknowledges that they are the representatives rather than the
corrupters of the world (vi. <a href="#stpage492A" class="pginternal">492 A</a>). He also becomes more dogmatic and
constructive, passing beyond the range either of the political or the
speculative ideas of the real Socrates. In one passage (vi. <a href="#stpage506C" class="pginternal">506 C</a>) Plato
himself seems to intimate that the time had now come for Socrates, who had
passed his whole life in philosophy, to give his own opinion and not to be
always repeating the notions of other men. There is no evidence that
either the idea of good or the conception of a perfect state were
comprehended in the Socratic teaching, though he certainly dwelt on the
nature of the universal and of final causes (cp. Xen. Mem. i. 4;
Phaedo 97); and a deep thinker like him, in his thirty or forty years of
public teaching, could hardly have failed to touch on the nature of family
relations, for which there is also some positive evidence in the
Memorabilia (Mem. i. 2, 51 foll.). The Socratic method is nominally
retained; and every inference is either put into the mouth of the
respondent or represented as the common discovery of him and Socrates.
But any one can see that this is a mere form, of which the affectation
grows wearisome as the work advances. The method of enquiry has passed
into a method of teaching in which by the help of interlocutors the same
thesis is looked at from various points of view. The nature of the process
is truly characterized by Glaucon, when he describes himself as a
companion who is not good for much in an investigation, but can see what
he is shown (iv. <a href="#stpage432C" class="pginternal">432 C</a>), and may, perhaps, give the answer to a question
more fluently than another (v. <a href="#stpage474A" class="pginternal">474 A</a>; cp. <a href="#stpage389A" class="pginternal">389 A</a>).
    </p>
<p>
      Neither can we be absolutely certain that Socrates himself <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexv"></a>xv</span> taught the
      immortality of the soul, which is unknown to his disciple Glaucon in the
      Republic (x. <a href="#stpage608D" class="pginternal">608 D</a>; cp. vi. <a href="#stpage498D" class="pginternal">498 D</a>, <a href="#stpage498E" class="pginternal">E</a>; Apol. 40, 41); nor is there any
reason to suppose that he used  myths or revelations of another world as a vehicle of instruction, or that
      he would have banished poetry or have denounced the Greek mythology. His
      favourite oath is retained, and a slight mention is made of the daemonium,
      or internal sign, which is alluded to by Socrates as a phenomenon peculiar
      to himself (vi. <a href="#stpage496C" class="pginternal">496 C</a>). A real element
of Socratic teaching, which is more prominent in the Republic than in any
of the other Dialogues of Plato, is the use of example and illustration
(<span class="transl" title="ta\ phortika\ au)tô=| prosphe/rontes">τὰ φορτικὰ αὐτῷ προσφέροντες</span>, iv. <a href="#stpage442E" class="pginternal">442 E</a>): ‘Let us apply the test of common
      instances.’ ‘You,’ says Adeimantus, ironically, in the sixth book, ‘are so
      unaccustomed to speak in images.’ And this use of examples or images,
      though truly Socratic in origin, is enlarged by the genius of Plato into
      the form of an allegory or parable, which embodies in the concrete what
      has been already described, or is about to be described, in the abstract.
      Thus the figure of the cave in Book VII is a recapitulation of the
      divisions of knowledge in Book VI. The composite animal in Book IX is an
      allegory of the parts of the soul. The noble captain and the ship and the
      true pilot in Book VI are a figure of the relation of the people to the
      philosophers in the State which has been described. Other figures, such as
      the dog (ii. <a href="#stpage375A" class="pginternal">375 A</a>, <a href="#stpage375D" class="pginternal">D</a>; iii. <a href="#stpage404A" class="pginternal">404 A</a>, <a href="#stpage416A" class="pginternal">416 A</a>; v. <a href="#stpage451D" class="pginternal">451 D</a>), or the marriage of the portionless maiden (vi. <a href="#stpage495A" class="pginternal">495</a>, <a href="#stpage496A" class="pginternal">496</a>), or the drones and
      wasps in the eighth and ninth books, also form links of connexion in long
      passages, or are used to recall previous discussions.
    </p>
<p>
      Plato is most true to the character of his master when he describes him as
      ‘not of this world.’ And with this representation of him the ideal state
      and the other paradoxes of the Republic are quite in accordance, though
      they cannot be shown to have been speculations of Socrates. To him, as to
      other great teachers both philosophical and religious, when they looked
      upward, the world seemed to be the embodiment of error and evil. The
      common sense of mankind has revolted against this view, or has only
      partially admitted it. And even in Socrates himself the sterner judgement
      of the multitude at times passes into a sort of ironical pity or love. Men  in general are incapable of philosophy, and are
therefore at enmity with the philosopher; but their misunderstanding of
him <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexvi"></a>xvi</span> is unavoidable (vi. <a href="#stpage494A" class="pginternal">494</a> foll.; ix. <a href="#stpage589D" class="pginternal">589 D</a>): for
      they have never seen him as he truly is in his own image; they are only
      acquainted with artificial systems possessing no native force of truth—words
      which admit of many applications. Their leaders have nothing to measure
      with, and are therefore ignorant of their own stature. But they are to be
      pitied or laughed at, not to be quarrelled with; they mean well with their
      nostrums, if they could only learn that they are cutting off a Hydra’s
      head (iv. <a href="#stpage426D" class="pginternal">426
D</a>, <a href="#stpage426E" class="pginternal">E</a>). This moderation towards those who are in error is one of the most
characteristic features of Socrates in the Republic (vi. <a href="#stpage499A" class="pginternal">499</a>–502). In all the different
      representations of Socrates, whether of Xenophon or Plato, and amid the
      differences of the earlier or later Dialogues, he always retains the
      character of the unwearied and disinterested seeker after truth, without
      which he would have ceased to be Socrates.
    </p>

<p>
      Leaving the characters we may now analyse the contents of the Republic,
      and then proceed to consider <a href="#end" class="pginternal">(1) The general aspects of this Hellenic
      ideal of the State, (2) The modern lights in which the thoughts of Plato

    </p>
<p> </p>
<p id="iaI"><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic I.</i><br>A<span class="smcap">NALYSIS.</span></span>
<b>BOOK I.</b> The Republic opens with a truly Greek scene—a festival in
      honour of the goddess Bendis which is held in the Piraeus; to this is
      added the promise of an equestrian torch-race in the evening. The whole
      work is supposed to be recited by Socrates on the day after the festival
      to a small party, consisting of Critias, Timaeus, Hermocrates, and
      another; this we learn from the first words of the Timaeus.
    </p>
<p>
      When the rhetorical advantage of reciting the Dialogue has been gained,
      the attention is not distracted by any reference to the audience; nor is
      the reader further reminded of the extraordinary length of the narrative.
      Of the numerous company, three only take any serious part in the
      discussion; nor are we informed whether in the evening they went to the
      torch-race, or talked, as in the Symposium, through the night. The manner
      in which the conversation has arisen is described as follows:—<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage327A" class="pginternal">Stephanus<br>327</a></span>Socrates
      and his companion Glaucon are about to leave the festival when they are
      detained by a message from Polemarchus, who speedily appears accompanied
      by Adeimantus, the brother of Glaucon, and with playful violence compels
      them to remain, promising them not only <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexvii"></a>xvii</span> the torch-race, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage328A" class="pginternal">328</a></span>but the pleasure
      of conversation with the young, which to Socrates is a far greater
      attraction. They return to the house of Cephalus, Polemarchus’ father, now
      in extreme old age, who is found sitting upon a cushioned seat crowned for
      a sacrifice. ‘You should come to me oftener, Socrates, for I am too old to
      go to you; and at my time of life, having lost other pleasures, I care the
      more for conversation.’ <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage329A" class="pginternal">329</a></span>Socrates asks him what he thinks of age, to which
      the old man replies, that the sorrows and discontents of age are to be
      attributed to the tempers of men, and that age is a time of peace in which
      the tyranny of the passions is no longer felt. Yes, replies Socrates, but
      the world will say, Cephalus, that you are happy in old age because you
      are rich. ‘And there is something in what they say, Socrates, but not so
      much as they imagine—<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage330A" class="pginternal">330</a></span>as Themistocles replied to the Seriphian,
      “Neither you, if you had been an Athenian, nor I, if I had been a
      Seriphian, would ever have been famous,” I might in like manner reply to
      you, Neither a good poor man can be happy in age, nor yet a bad rich man.’
      Socrates remarks that Cephalus appears not to care about riches, a quality
      which he ascribes to his having inherited, not acquired them, and would
      like to know what he considers to be the chief advantage of them. Cephalus
      answers that when you are old the belief in the world below grows upon
      you, and then to have done justice and never to have been compelled to do
      injustice through poverty, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage331A" class="pginternal">331</a></span>and never to have deceived anyone, are felt to
      be unspeakable blessings. Socrates, who is evidently preparing for an
      argument, next asks, What is the meaning of the word ‘justice’? To tell the
      truth and pay your debts? No more than this? Or must we admit exceptions?
      Ought I, for example, to put back into the hands of my friend, who has
      gone mad, the sword which I borrowed of him when he was in his right mind?
      ‘There must be exceptions.’ ‘And yet,’ says Polemarchus, ‘the definition
      which has been given has the authority of Simonides.’ Here Cephalus
      retires to look after the sacrifices, and bequeaths, as Socrates
      facetiously remarks, the possession of the argument to his heir,
      Polemarchus….
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic I.</i><br>I<span class="smcap">NTRODUCTION.</span></span>
      The description of old age is finished, and Plato, as his manner is, has
      touched the key-note of the whole work in asking for the definition of
      justice, first suggesting the question which Glaucon afterwards pursues
      respecting external goods, and preparing for <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexviii"></a>xviii</span> the concluding mythus of the
      world below in the slight allusion of Cephalus. The portrait of the just
      man is a natural frontispiece or introduction to the long discourse which
      follows, and may perhaps imply that in all our perplexity about the nature
      of justice, there is no difficulty in discerning ‘who is a just man.’ The
      first explanation has been supported by a saying of Simonides; and now
      Socrates has a mind to show that the resolution of justice into two
      unconnected precepts, which have no common principle, fails to satisfy the
      demands of dialectic.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic I.</i><br>A<span class="smcap">NALYSIS.</span></span>
      … <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage332A" class="pginternal">332</a></span>He proceeds: What did Simonides mean by this saying of his? Did he mean
      that I was to give back arms to a madman? ‘No, not in that case, not if
      the parties are friends, and evil would result. He meant that you were to
      do what was proper, good to friends and harm to enemies.’ Every act does
      something to somebody; and following this analogy, Socrates asks, What is
      this due and proper thing which justice does, and to whom? He is answered
      that justice does good to friends and harm to enemies. But in what way
      good or harm? ‘In making alliances with the one, and going to war with the
      other.’ Then in time of peace what is the good of justice? <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage333A" class="pginternal">333</a></span>The answer is
      that justice is of use in contracts, and contracts are money partnerships.
      Yes; but how in such partnerships is the just man of more use than any
      other man? ‘When you want to have money safely kept and not used.’ Then
      justice will be useful when  money is useless. And there is another
      difficulty: justice, like the art of war or any other art, must be of
      opposites, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage334A" class="pginternal">334</a></span>good at attack as well as at defence, at stealing as well as at
      guarding. But then justice is a thief, though a hero notwithstanding, like
      Autolycus, the Homeric hero, who was ‘excellent above all men in theft and
      perjury’—to such a pass have you and Homer and Simonides brought us;
      though I do not forget that the thieving must be for the good of friends
      and the harm of enemies. And still there arises another question: Are
      friends to be interpreted as real or seeming; enemies as real or seeming? <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage335A" class="pginternal">335</a></span>And
       are our friends to be only the good, and our enemies to be the evil?
      The answer is, that we must do good to our seeming and real good friends,
      and evil to our seeming and real evil enemies—good to the good, evil
      to the evil. But ought we to render evil for evil at all, when to do so
      will only make men more evil? Can justice produce injustice any more than
      the art of horsemanship <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexix"></a>xix</span> can make bad horsemen, or heat produce cold? The
      final conclusion is, that no sage or poet ever said that the just return
      evil for evil; this was a maxim of some rich and mighty man, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage336A" class="pginternal">336</a></span>Periander,
      Perdiccas, or Ismenias the Theban (about <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 398-381)….
    </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic I.</i><br>I<span class="smcap">NTRODUCTION.</span></span>
      Thus the first stage of aphoristic or unconscious morality is shown to be
      inadequate to the wants of the age; the authority of the poets is set
      aside, and through the winding mazes of dialectic we make an approach to
      the Christian precept of forgiveness of injuries. Similar words are
      applied by the Persian mystic poet to the Divine being when the
      questioning spirit is stirred within him:—‘If because I do evil,
      Thou punishest me by evil, what is the difference between Thee and me?’ In
      this both Plato and Khèyam rise above the level of many Christian (?)
      theologians. The first definition of justice easily passes into the
      second; for the simple words ‘to speak the truth and pay your debts’ is
      substituted the more abstract ‘to do good to your friends and harm to your
      enemies.’ Either of these explanations gives a sufficient rule of life for
      plain men, but they both fall short of the precision of philosophy. We may
      note in passing the antiquity of casuistry, which not only arises out of
      the conflict of established principles in particular cases, but also out
      of the effort to attain them, and is prior as well as posterior to our
      fundamental notions of morality. The ‘interrogation’ of moral ideas; the
      appeal to the authority of Homer; the conclusion that the maxim, ‘Do good
      to your friends and harm to your enemies,’ being erroneous, could not have
      been the word of any great man (cp. ii. <a href="#stpage380A" class="pginternal">380 A</a>, <a href="#stpage380B" class="pginternal">B</a>), are all of them very characteristic of the
      Platonic Socrates.
    </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic I.</i><br>A<span class="smcap">NALYSIS.</span></span>
      … Here Thrasymachus, who has made several attempts to interrupt, but has
      hitherto been kept in order by the company, takes advantage of a pause and
      rushes into the arena, beginning, like a savage animal, with a roar.
      ‘Socrates,’ he says, ‘what folly is this?—Why do you agree to be
      vanquished by one another in a pretended argument?’ He then prohibits all
      the ordinary definitions of justice; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage337A" class="pginternal">337</a></span>to which Socrates replies that he
      cannot tell how many twelve is, if he is forbidden to say 2 × 6, or 3 × 4,
      or 6 × 2, or 4 × 3. At first Thrasymachus is reluctant to argue; but at
      length, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage338A" class="pginternal">338</a></span>with a promise of payment on the part of <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexx"></a>xx</span> the company and of praise
      from Socrates, he is induced to open the game. ‘Listen,’ he says, ‘my
      answer is that might is right, justice the interest of the stronger: now
      praise me.’ Let me understand you first. Do you mean that because
      Polydamas the wrestler, who is stronger than we are, finds the eating of
      beef for his interest, the eating of beef is also for our interest, who
      are not so strong? Thrasymachus is indignant at the illustration, and in
      pompous words, apparently intended to restore dignity to the argument, he
      explains his meaning to be that the rulers make laws for their own
      interests. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage339A" class="pginternal">339</a></span>But suppose, says Socrates, that the ruler or stronger makes a
      mistake—then the interest of the stronger is not his interest.
      Thrasymachus is saved from this speedy downfall by his disciple
      Cleitophon, who introduces the word ‘thinks;’<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage340A" class="pginternal">340</a></span>—not the actual
      interest of the ruler, but what he thinks or what seems to be his
      interest, is justice. The contradiction is escaped by the unmeaning
      evasion: for though his real and apparent interests may differ, what the
      ruler thinks to be his interest will always remain what he thinks to be
      his interest.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course this was not the original assertion, nor is the new
      interpretation accepted by Thrasymachus himself. But Socrates is not
      disposed to quarrel about words, if, as he significantly insinuates, his
      adversary has changed his mind. In what follows Thrasymachus does in fact
      withdraw his admission that the ruler may make a mistake, for he affirms
      that the ruler as a ruler is infallible. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage341A" class="pginternal">341</a></span>Socrates is quite ready to accept
      the new position, which he equally turns against Thrasymachus by the help
      of the analogy of the arts. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage342A" class="pginternal">342</a></span>Every art or science has an interest, but this
      interest is to be distinguished from the accidental interest of the
      artist, and is only concerned with the good of the things or persons which
      come under the art. And justice has an interest which is the interest not
      of the ruler or judge, but of those who come under his sway.
    </p>
<p>
      Thrasymachus is on the brink of the inevitable conclusion, when he makes a
      bold diversion. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage343A" class="pginternal">343</a></span>‘Tell me, Socrates,’ he says, ‘have you a nurse?’ What a
      question! Why do you ask? ‘Because, if you have, she neglects you and lets
      you go about drivelling, and has not even taught you to know the shepherd
      from the sheep. For you fancy that shepherds and rulers never think of
      their own interest, but only of their sheep or subjects, <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxi"></a>xxi</span> whereas the truth
      is that they fatten them for their use, sheep and subjects alike. And
      experience proves that in every relation of life the just man is the loser
      and the unjust the gainer, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage344A" class="pginternal">344</a></span>especially where injustice is on the grand
      scale, which is quite another thing from the petty rogueries of swindlers
      and burglars and robbers of temples. The language of men proves this—our
      ‘gracious’ and ‘blessed’ tyrant and the like—all which tends to show
      (1) that justice is the interest of the stronger; and (2) that injustice
      is more profitable and also stronger than justice.’
    </p>
<p>
      Thrasymachus, who is better at a speech than at a close argument, having
      deluged the company with words, has a mind to escape. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage345A" class="pginternal">345</a></span>But the others will
      not let him go, and Socrates adds a humble but earnest request that he
      will not desert them at such a crisis of their fate. ‘And what can I do
      more for you?’ he says; ‘would you have me put the words bodily into your
      souls?’ God forbid! replies Socrates; but we want you to be consistent in
      the use of terms, and not to employ ‘physician’ in an exact sense, and
      then again ‘shepherd’ or ‘ruler’ in an inexact,—if the words are
      strictly taken, the ruler and the shepherd look only to the good of their
      people or flocks and not to their own: whereas you insist that rulers are
      solely actuated by love of office. ‘No doubt about it,’ replies
      Thrasymachus. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage346A" class="pginternal">346</a></span>Then why are they paid? Is not the reason, that their
      interest is not comprehended in their art, and is therefore the concern of
      another art, the art of pay, which is common to the arts in general, and
      therefore not identical with any one of them? <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage347A" class="pginternal">347</a></span>Nor would any man be a ruler
      unless he were induced by the hope of reward or the fear of punishment;—the
      reward is money or honour, the punishment is the necessity of being ruled
      by a man worse than himself. And if a State [or Church] were composed
      entirely of good men, they would be affected by the last motive only; and
      there would be as much ‘nolo episcopari’ as there is at present of the
      opposite….
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic I.</i><br>I<span class="smcap">NTRODUCTION.</span></span>
      The satire on existing governments is heightened by the simple and
      apparently incidental manner in which the last remark is introduced. There
      is a similar irony in the argument that the governors of mankind do not
      like being in office, and that therefore they demand pay.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic I.</i><br>A<span class="smcap">NALYSIS.</span></span>
      … Enough of this: the other assertion of Thrasymachus is far <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxii"></a>xxii</span> more
      important—that the unjust life is more gainful than the just. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage348A" class="pginternal">348</a></span>Now,
      as you and I, Glaucon, are not convinced by him, we must reply to him; but
      if we try to compare their respective gains we shall want a judge to
      decide for us; we had better therefore proceed by making mutual admissions
      of the truth to one another.
    </p>
<p>
      Thrasymachus had asserted that perfect injustice was more gainful than
      perfect justice, and after a little hesitation he is induced by Socrates
      <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage349A" class="pginternal">349</a></span>to admit the still greater paradox that injustice is virtue and justice
      vice. Socrates praises his frankness, and assumes the attitude of one
      whose only wish is to understand the meaning of his opponents. At the same
      time he is weaving a net in which Thrasymachus is finally enclosed. The
      admission is elicited from him that the just man seeks to gain an
      advantage over the unjust only, but not over the just, while the unjust
      would gain an advantage over either. Socrates, in order to test this
      statement, employs once more the favourite analogy of the arts. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage350A" class="pginternal">350</a></span>The
      musician, doctor, skilled artist of any sort, does not seek to gain more
      than the skilled, but only more than the unskilled (that is to say, he
      works up to a rule, standard, law, and does not exceed it), whereas the
      unskilled makes random efforts at excess. Thus the skilled falls on the
      side of the good, and the unskilled on the side of the evil, and the just
      is the skilled, and the unjust is the unskilled.
    </p>
<p>
      There was great difficulty in bringing Thrasymachus to the point; the day
      was hot and he was streaming with perspiration, and for the first time in
      his life he was seen to blush. But his other thesis that injustice was
      stronger than justice has not yet been refuted, and Socrates now proceeds
      to the consideration of this, which, with the assistance of Thrasymachus,
      he hopes to clear up; the latter is at first churlish, but in the
      judicious hands of Socrates is soon restored to good humour: <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage351A" class="pginternal">351</a></span>Is there not
      honour among thieves? Is not the strength of injustice only a remnant of
      justice? Is not absolute injustice absolute weakness also? <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage352A" class="pginternal">352</a></span>A house that is
      divided against itself cannot stand; two men who quarrel detract from one
      another’s strength, and he who is at war with himself is the enemy of
      himself and the gods. Not wickedness therefore, but semi-wickedness
      flourishes in states,—a remnant of good is needed in order to make
      union in action possible,—there is no kingdom of evil in this world.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxiii"></a>xxiii</span> Another question has not been answered: Is the just or the unjust the
      happier? To this we reply, that every art has an end and an excellence or
      virtue by which the end is accomplished. And is not the end of the soul
      happiness, and justice the excellence of the soul by which happiness is
      attained? <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage354A" class="pginternal">354</a></span>Justice and happiness being thus shown to be inseparable, the
      question whether the just or the unjust is the happier has disappeared.
    </p>
<p>
      Thrasymachus replies: ‘Let this be your entertainment, Socrates, at the
      festival of Bendis.’ Yes; and a very good entertainment with which your
      kindness has supplied me, now that you have left off scolding. And yet not
      a good entertainment—but that was my own fault, for I tasted of too
      many things. First of all the nature of justice was the subject of our
      enquiry, and then whether justice is virtue and wisdom, or evil and folly;
      and then the comparative advantages of just and unjust: and the sum of all
      is that I know not what justice is; how then shall I know whether the just
      is happy or not?…
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic I.</i><br>I<span class="smcap">NTRODUCTION.</span></span>
      Thus the sophistical fabric has been demolished, chiefly by appealing to
      the analogy of the arts. ‘Justice is like the arts (1) in having no
      external interest, and (2) in not aiming at excess, and (3) justice is to
      happiness what the implement of the workman is to his work.’ At this the
      modern reader is apt to stumble, because he forgets that Plato is writing
      in an age when the arts and the virtues, like the moral and intellectual
      faculties, were still undistinguished. Among early enquirers into the
      nature of human action the arts helped to fill up the void of speculation;
      and at first the comparison of the arts and the virtues was not perceived
      by them to be fallacious. They only saw the points of agreement in them
      and not the points of difference. Virtue, like art, must take means to an
      end; good manners are both an art and a virtue; character is naturally
      described under the image of a statue (ii. <a href="#stpage361D" class="pginternal">361 D</a>; vii. <a href="#stpage540C" class="pginternal">540 C</a>); and there are many other figures of
      speech which are readily transferred from art to morals. The next
      generation cleared up these perplexities; or at least supplied after ages
      with a further analysis of them. The contemporaries of Plato were in a
      state of transition, and had not yet fully realized the common-sense
      distinction of Aristotle, that ‘virtue is concerned with action, art with
      production’ (Nic. Eth. vi. 4), or that ‘virtue implies intention and constancy
      of purpose,’ <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxiv"></a>xxiv</span> whereas ‘art requires knowledge only’ (Nic. Eth. vi. 3). And yet in the
      absurdities which follow from some uses of the analogy (cp. i. <a href="#stpage333E" class="pginternal">333 E</a>, <a href="#stpage334B" class="pginternal">334 B</a>), there seems to be
      an intimation conveyed that virtue is more than art. This is implied in
      the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> that ‘justice is a thief,’ and in the
      dissatisfaction which Socrates expresses at the final result.
    </p>
<p>
      The expression ‘an art of pay’ (i. <a href="#stpage346B" class="pginternal">346 B</a>) which is described as ‘common to all the
      arts’ is not in accordance with the ordinary use of language. Nor is it
      employed elsewhere either by Plato or by any other Greek writer. It is
      suggested by the argument, and seems to extend the conception of art to
      doing as well as making. Another flaw or inaccuracy of language may be
      noted in the words (i. <a href="#stpage335C" class="pginternal">335 C</a>) ‘men who are injured are made more unjust.’ For those
      who are injured are not necessarily made worse, but only harmed or
      ill-treated.
    </p>
<p>
      The second of the three arguments, ‘that the just does not aim at excess,’
      has a real meaning, though wrapped up in an enigmatical form. That the
      good is of the nature of the finite is a peculiarly Hellenic sentiment,
      which may be compared with the language of those modern writers who speak
      of virtue as fitness, and of freedom as obedience to law. The mathematical
      or logical notion of limit easily passes into an ethical one, and even
      finds a mythological expression in the conception of envy (<span class="transl" title="phtho/nos">φθόνος</span>). Ideas
      of measure, equality, order, unity, proportion, still linger in the
      writings of moralists; and the true spirit of the fine arts is better
      conveyed by such terms than by superlatives.

      Hellenic mode of conceiving the perfection of human nature.
    </p>
<p>
      In what may be called the epilogue of the discussion with Thrasymachus,
      Plato argues that evil is not a principle of strength, but of discord and
      dissolution, just touching the question which has been often treated in
      modern times by theologians and philosophers, of the negative nature of
      evil (cp. on the other hand x. <a href="#stpage610A" class="pginternal">610</a>). In the last argument we trace the germ of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxv"></a>xxv</span> Aristotelian doctrine
      of an end and a virtue directed towards the end, which again is suggested
      by the arts. The final reconcilement of justice and happiness and the
      identity of the individual and the State are also intimated. Socrates
      reassumes the character of a ‘know-nothing;’ at the same time he appears
      to be not wholly satisfied with the manner in which the argument has been
      conducted. Nothing is concluded; but the tendency of the dialectical
      process, here as always, is to enlarge our conception of ideas, and to
      widen their application to human life.
    </p>
<p> </p>
<p id="iaII"><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic II.</i><br>A<span class="smcap">NALYSIS.</span></span>
<b>BOOK II.</b> Thrasymachus is pacified, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage357A" class="pginternal">357</a></span>but the intrepid Glaucon insists on
      continuing the argument. He is not satisfied with the indirect manner in
      which, at the end of the last book, Socrates had disposed of the question
      ‘Whether the just or the unjust is the happier.’ He begins by dividing
      goods into three classes:—first, goods desirable in themselves;
      secondly, goods desirable in themselves and for their results; thirdly,
      goods desirable for their results only. He then asks Socrates in which of
      the three classes he would place justice. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage358A" class="pginternal">358</a></span>In the second class, replies
      Socrates, among goods desirable for themselves and also for their results.
      ‘Then the world in general are of another mind, for they say that justice
      belongs to the troublesome class of goods which are desirable for their
      results only.<span class="correction" title="quotation mark dropped out after 1st edition">’</span> Socrates answers that this is the doctrine of Thrasymachus
      which he rejects. Glaucon thinks that Thrasymachus was too ready to listen
      to the voice of the charmer, and proposes to consider the nature of
      justice and injustice in themselves and apart from the results and rewards
      of them which the world is always dinning in his ears. He will first of
      all speak of the nature and origin of justice; secondly, of the manner in
      which men view justice as a necessity and not a good; and thirdly, he will
      prove the reasonableness of this view.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘To do injustice is said to be a good; to suffer injustice an evil. As the
      evil is discovered by experience to be greater than the good, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage359A" class="pginternal">359</a></span>the
      sufferers, who cannot also be doers, make a compact that they will have
      neither, and this compact or mean is called justice, but is really the
      impossibility of doing injustice. No one would observe such a compact if
      he were not obliged. Let us suppose that the just and unjust have two
      rings, like that of Gyges <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxvi"></a>xxvi</span> in the well-known story, which make them
      invisible,<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage360A" class="pginternal">360</a></span> and then no difference will appear in them, for every one will
      do evil if he can. And he who abstains will be regarded by the world as a
      fool for his pains. Men may praise him in public out of fear for
      themselves, but they will laugh at him in their hearts. (Cp. Gorgias, 483 B.)
    </p>
<p>
      ‘And now let us frame an ideal of the just and unjust. Imagine the unjust
      man to be master of his craft, seldom making mistakes and easily
      correcting them; having gifts of money, speech, strength—<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage361A" class="pginternal">361</a></span>the
      greatest villain bearing the highest character: and at his side let us
      place the just in his nobleness and simplicity—being, not seeming—without
      name or reward—clothed in his justice only—the best of men who
      is thought to be the worst, and let him die as he has lived. I might add
      (but I would rather put the rest into the mouth of the panegyrists of
      injustice—they will tell you) that the just man will be scourged,
      racked, bound, will have his eyes put out, and will at last be crucified
      [literally <i>impaled</i>]—and all this because he ought to have preferred
      seeming to being. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage362A" class="pginternal">362</a></span>How different is the case of the unjust who clings to
      appearance as the true reality! His high character makes him a ruler; he
      can marry where he likes, trade where he likes, help his friends and hurt
      his enemies; having got rich by dishonesty he can worship the gods better,
      and will therefore be more loved by them than the just.’
    </p>
<p>
      I was thinking what to answer, when Adeimantus joined in the already
      unequal fray. He considered that the most important point of all had been
      omitted:—‘Men are taught to be just for the sake of rewards; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage363A" class="pginternal">363</a></span>parents
      and guardians make reputation the incentive to virtue. And other
      advantages are promised by them of a more solid kind, such as wealthy
      marriages and high offices. There are the pictures in Homer and Hesiod of
      fat sheep and heavy fleeces, rich corn-fields and trees toppling with
      fruit, which the gods provide in this life for the just. And the Orphic
      poets add a similar picture of another. The heroes of Musaeus and Eumolpus
      lie on couches at a festival, with garlands on their heads, enjoying as
      the meed of virtue a paradise of immortal drunkenness. Some go further,
      and speak of a fair posterity in the third and fourth generation. But the
      wicked they bury in a slough and make them carry water in a sieve: and in
      this life they <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxvii"></a>xxvii</span> attribute to them the infamy which Glaucon was assuming to
      be the lot of the just who are supposed to be unjust.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage364A" class="pginternal">364</a></span>Take another kind of argument which is found both in poetry and prose:—“Virtue,”
      as Hesiod says, “is honourable but difficult, vice is easy and
      profitable.” You may often see the wicked in great prosperity and the
      righteous afflicted by the will of heaven. And mendicant prophets knock at
      rich men’s doors, promising to atone for the sins of themselves or their
      fathers in an easy fashion with sacrifices and festive games, or with
      charms and invocations to get rid of an enemy good or bad by divine help
      and at a small charge;—they appeal to books professing to be written
      by Musaeus and Orpheus, and carry away the minds of whole cities, and
      promise to “get souls out of purgatory;” and if we refuse to listen to
      them, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage365A" class="pginternal">365</a></span>no one knows what will happen to us.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘When a lively-minded ingenuous youth hears all this, what will be his
      conclusion? “Will he,” in the language of Pindar, “make justice his high
      tower, or fortify himself with crooked deceit?” Justice, he reflects,
      without the appearance of justice, is misery and ruin; injustice has the
      promise of a glorious life. Appearance is master of truth and lord of
      happiness. To appearance then I will turn,—I will put on the show of
      virtue and trail behind me the fox of Archilochus. I hear some one saying
      that “wickedness is not easily concealed,” to which I reply that “nothing
      great is easy.” Union and force and rhetoric will do much; and if men say
      that they cannot prevail over the gods, still how do we know that there
      are gods? Only from the poets, who acknowledge that they may be appeased
      by sacrifices. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage366A" class="pginternal">366</a></span>Then why not sin and pay for indulgences out of your sin?
      For if the righteous are only unpunished, still they have no further
      reward, while the wicked may be unpunished and have the pleasure of
      sinning too. But what of the world below? Nay, says the argument, there
      are atoning powers who will set that matter right, as the poets, who are
      the sons of the gods, tell us; and this is confirmed by the authority of
      the State.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘How can we resist such arguments in favour of injustice? Add good
      manners, and, as the wise tell us, we shall make the best of both worlds.
      Who that is not a miserable caitiff will refrain from smiling at the
      praises of justice? Even if a man knows the better part he will not be
      angry with others; for he knows also that <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxviii"></a>xxviii</span> more than human virtue is needed
      to save a man, and that he only praises justice who is incapable of
      injustice.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The origin of the evil is that all men from the beginning, heroes, poets,
      instructors of youth, have always asserted “the temporal dispensation,”
      the honours and profits of justice. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage367A" class="pginternal">367</a></span>Had we been taught in early youth the
      power of justice and injustice inherent in the soul, and unseen by any
      human or divine eye, we should not have needed others to be our guardians,
      but every one would have been the guardian of himself. This is what I want
      you to show, Socrates;—other men use arguments which rather tend to
      strengthen the position of Thrasymachus that “might is right;” but from
      you I expect better things. And please, as Glaucon said, to exclude
      reputation; let the just be thought unjust and the unjust just, and do you
      still prove to us the superiority of justice.’…
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic II.</i><br>I<span class="smcap">NTRODUCTION.</span></span>
      The thesis, which for the sake of argument has been maintained by Glaucon,
      is the converse of that of Thrasymachus—not right is the interest of
      the stronger, but right is the necessity of the weaker. Starting from the
      same premises he carries the analysis of society a step further back;—might
      is still right, but the might is the weakness of the many combined against
      the strength of the few.
    </p>
<p>
      There have been theories in modern as well as in ancient times which have
      a family likeness to the speculations of Glaucon; e.g. that power is the
      foundation of right; or that a monarch has a divine right to govern well
      or ill; or that virtue is self-love or the love of power; or that war is
      the natural state of man; or that private vices are public benefits. All
      such theories have a kind of plausibility from their partial agreement
      with experience. For human nature oscillates between good and evil, and
      the motives of actions and the origin of institutions may be explained to
      a certain extent on either hypothesis according to the character or point
      of view of a particular thinker. The obligation of maintaining authority
      under all circumstances and sometimes by rather questionable means is felt
      strongly and has become a sort of instinct among civilized men. The divine
      right of kings, or more generally of governments, is one of the forms
      under which this natural feeling is expressed. Nor again is there any evil
      which has not some accompaniment of good or pleasure; nor any good <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxix"></a>xxix</span> which
      is free from some alloy of evil; nor any noble or generous thought which
      may not be attended by a shadow or the ghost of a shadow of self-interest
      or of self-love. We know that all human actions are imperfect; but we do
      not therefore attribute them to the worse rather than to the better motive
      or principle. Such a philosophy is both foolish and false, like that
      opinion of the clever rogue who assumes all other men to be like himself (iii. <a href="#stpage409C" class="pginternal">409 C</a>).
      And theories of this sort do not represent the real nature of the State,
      which is based on a vague sense of right gradually corrected and enlarged
      by custom and law (although capable also of perversion), any more than
      they describe the origin of society, which is to be sought in the family
      and in the social and religious feelings of man. Nor do they represent the
      average character of individuals, which cannot be explained simply on a
      theory of evil, but has always a counteracting element of good. And as men
      become better such theories appear more and more untruthful to them,
      because they are more conscious of their own disinterestedness. A little
      experience may make a man a cynic; a great deal will bring him back to a
      truer and kindlier view of the mixed nature of himself and his fellow men.
    </p>
<p>
      The two brothers ask Socrates to prove to them that the just is happy when
      they have taken from him all that in which happiness is ordinarily
      supposed to consist. Not that there is (1) any absurdity in the attempt to
      frame a notion of justice apart from circumstances. For the ideal must
      always be a paradox when compared with the ordinary conditions of human
      life. Neither the Stoical ideal nor the Christian ideal is true as a fact,
      but they may serve as a basis of education, and may exercise an ennobling
      influence. An ideal is none the worse because ‘some one has made the
      discovery’ that no such ideal was ever realized. (Cp. v. <a href="#stpage472D" class="pginternal">472 D</a>.) And in a few exceptional
      individuals who are raised above the ordinary level of humanity, the ideal
      of happiness may be realized in death and misery. This may be the state
      which the reason deliberately approves, and which the utilitarian as well
      as every other moralist may be bound in certain cases to prefer.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor again, (2) must we forget that Plato, though he agrees generally with
      the view implied in the argument of the two brothers, is not expressing
      his own final conclusion, but rather <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxx"></a>xxx</span> seeking to dramatize one of the
      aspects of ethical truth. He is developing his idea gradually in a series
      of positions or situations. He is exhibiting Socrates for the first time
      undergoing the Socratic interrogation. Lastly, (3) the word ‘happiness’
      involves some degree of confusion because associated in the language of
      modern philosophy with conscious pleasure or satisfaction, which was not
      equally present to his mind.
    </p>
<p>
      Glaucon has been drawing a picture of the misery of the just and the
      happiness of the unjust, to which the misery of the tyrant in Book IX is
      the answer and parallel. And still the unjust must appear just; that is
      ‘the homage which vice pays to virtue.’ But now Adeimantus, taking up the
      hint which had been already given by Glaucon (ii. <a href="#stpage358C" class="pginternal">358 C</a>), proceeds to show that in the
      opinion of mankind justice is regarded only for the sake of rewards and
      reputation, and points out the advantage which is given to such arguments
      as those of Thrasymachus and Glaucon by the conventional morality of
      mankind. He seems to feel the difficulty of ‘justifying the ways of God to
      man.’ Both the brothers touch upon the question, whether the morality of
      actions is determined by their consequences (cp. iv. <a href="#stpage420A" class="pginternal">420</a> foll.); and both of them go beyond
      the position of Socrates, that justice belongs to the class of goods not
      desirable for themselves only, but desirable for themselves and for their
      results, to which he recalls them. In their attempt to view justice as an
      internal principle, and in their condemnation of the poets, they
      anticipate him. The common life of Greece is not enough for them; they
      must penetrate deeper into the nature of things.
    </p>
<p>
      It has been objected that justice is honesty in the sense of Glaucon and
      Adeimantus, but is taken by Socrates to mean all virtue. May we not more
      truly say that the old-fashioned notion of justice is enlarged by
      Socrates, and becomes equivalent to universal order or well-being, first
      in the State, and secondly in the individual? He has found a new answer to
      his old question (Protag. 329), ‘whether the virtues are one or many,’ viz.
      that one is the ordering principle of the three others. In seeking to
      establish the purely internal nature of justice, he is met by the fact
      that man is a social being, and he tries to harmonise the two opposite
      theses as well as he can. There is no more inconsistency in this than was
      inevitable in his age and country; <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxxi"></a>xxxi</span> there is no use in turning upon him the
      cross lights of modern philosophy, which, from some other point of view,
      would appear equally inconsistent. Plato does not give the final solution
      of philosophical questions for us; nor can he be judged of by our
      standard.
    </p>
<p>
      The remainder of the Republic is developed out of the question of the sons
      of Ariston. Three points are deserving of remark in what immediately
      follows:—First, that the answer of Socrates is altogether indirect.
      He does not say that happiness consists in the contemplation of the idea
      of justice, and still less will he be tempted to affirm the Stoical
      paradox that the just man can be happy on the rack. But first he dwells on
      the difficulty of the problem and insists on restoring man to his natural
      condition, before he will answer the question at all. He too will frame an
      ideal, but his ideal comprehends not only abstract justice, but the whole
      relations of man. Under the fanciful illustration of the large letters he
      implies that he will only look for justice in society, and that from the
      State he will proceed to the individual. His answer in substance amounts
      to this,—that under favourable conditions, i.e. in the perfect
      State, justice and happiness will coincide, and that when justice has been
      once found, happiness may be left to take care of itself. That he falls
      into some degree of inconsistency, when in the tenth book (<a href="#stpage612A" class="pginternal">612 A</a>) he claims to
      have got rid of the rewards and honours of justice, may be admitted; for
      he has left those which exist in the perfect State. And the philosopher
      ‘who retires under the shelter of a wall’ (vi. <a href="#stpage496A" class="pginternal">496</a>) can hardly have been esteemed
      happy by him, at least not in this world. Still he maintains the true
      attitude of moral action. Let a man do his duty first, without asking
      whether he will be happy or not, and happiness will be the inseparable
      accident which attends him. ‘Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
      righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.’
    </p>
<p>
      Secondly, it may be remarked that Plato preserves the genuine character of
      Greek thought in beginning with the State and in going on to the
      individual. First ethics, then politics—this is the order of ideas
      to us; the reverse is the order of history. Only after many struggles of
      thought does the individual assert his right as a moral being. In early
      ages he is not <em>one</em>, but one of many, the citizen of a State which is prior
      to him; and he <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxxii"></a>xxxii</span> has no notion of good or evil apart from the law of his
      country or the creed of his church. And to this type he is constantly
      tending to revert, whenever the influence of custom, or of party spirit,
      or the recollection of the past becomes too strong for him.
    </p>
<p>
      Thirdly, we may observe the confusion or identification of the individual
      and the State, of ethics and politics, which pervades early Greek
      speculation, and even in modern times retains a certain degree of
      influence. The subtle difference between the collective and individual
      action of mankind seems to have escaped early thinkers, and we too are
      sometimes in danger of forgetting the conditions of united human action,
      whenever we either elevate politics into ethics, or lower ethics to the
      standard of politics. The good man and the good citizen only coincide in
      the perfect State; and this perfection cannot be attained by legislation
      acting upon them from without, but, if at all, by education fashioning
      them from within.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic II.</i><br>A<span class="smcap">NALYSIS.</span></span>
      … Socrates praises the sons of Ariston, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage368A" class="pginternal">368</a></span>‘inspired offspring of the
      renowned hero,’ as the elegiac poet terms them; but he does not understand
      how they can argue so eloquently on behalf of injustice while their
      character shows that they are uninfluenced by their own arguments. He
      knows not how to answer them, although he is afraid of deserting justice
      in the hour of need. He therefore makes a condition, that having weak eyes
      he shall be allowed to read the large letters first and then go on to the
      smaller, that is, he must look for justice in the State first, and will
      then proceed to the individual. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage369A" class="pginternal">369</a></span> Accordingly he begins to construct the
      State.
    </p>
<p>
      Society arises out of the wants of man. His first want is food; his second
      a house; his third a coat. The sense of these needs and the possibility of
      satisfying them by exchange, draw individuals together on the same spot;
      and this is the beginning of a State, which we take the liberty to invent,
      although necessity is the real inventor. There must be first a husbandman,
      secondly a builder, thirdly a weaver, to which may be added a cobbler.
      Four or five citizens at least are required to make a city. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage370A" class="pginternal">370</a></span>Now men have
      different natures, and one man will do one thing better than many; and
      business waits for no man. Hence there must be a division of labour into
      different employments; into wholesale and retail trade; into workers, and
      makers of workmen’s <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxxiii"></a>xxxiii</span> tools; into shepherds and husbandmen. A city which
      includes all this will have far exceeded the limit of four or five, and
      yet not be very large. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage371A" class="pginternal">371</a></span>But then again imports will be required, and
      imports necessitate exports, and this implies variety of produce in order
      to attract the taste of purchasers; also merchants and ships. In the city
      too we must have a market and money and retail trades; otherwise buyers
      and sellers will never meet, and the valuable time of the producers will
      be wasted in vain efforts at exchange. If we add hired servants the State
      will be complete. And we may guess that <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage372A" class="pginternal">372</a></span>somewhere in the intercourse of
      the citizens with one another justice and injustice will appear.
    </p>
<p>
      Here follows a rustic picture of their way of life. They spend their days
      in houses which they have built for themselves; they make their own
      clothes and produce their own corn and wine. Their principal food is meal
      and flour, and they drink in moderation. They live on the best of terms
      with each other, and take care not to have too many children. ‘But,’ said
      Glaucon, interposing, ‘are they not to have a relish?’ Certainly; they
      will have salt and olives and cheese, vegetables and fruits, and chestnuts
      to roast at the fire. ‘’Tis a city of pigs, Socrates.’ Why, I replied,
      what do you want more? ‘Only the comforts of life,—sofas and tables,
      also sauces and sweets.’ I see; you want not only a State, but a luxurious
      State; and possibly in the more complex frame we may sooner find justice
      and injustice. Then <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage373A" class="pginternal">373</a></span>the fine arts must go to work—every conceivable
      instrument and ornament of luxury will be wanted. There will be dancers,
      painters, sculptors, musicians, cooks, barbers, tire-women, nurses,
      artists; swineherds and neatherds too for the animals, and physicians to
      cure the disorders of which luxury is the source. To feed all these
      superfluous mouths we shall need a part of our neighbour’s land, and they
      will want a part of ours. And this is the origin of war, which may be
      traced to the same causes as other political evils. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage374A" class="pginternal">374</a></span>Our city will now
      require the slight addition of a camp, and the citizen will be converted
      into a soldier. But then again our old doctrine of the division of labour
      must not be forgotten. The art of war cannot be learned in a day, and
      there must be a natural aptitude for military duties. There will be some
      warlike natures <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage375A" class="pginternal">375</a></span>who have this aptitude—dogs keen of scent, swift of
      foot to pursue, and strong of limb to fight. And <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxxiv"></a>xxxiv</span> as spirit is the
      foundation of courage, such natures, whether of men or animals, will be
      full of spirit. But these spirited natures are apt to bite and devour one
      another; the union of gentleness to friends and fierceness against enemies
      appears to be an impossibility, and the guardian of a State requires both
      qualities. Who then can be a guardian? The image of the dog suggests an
      answer. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage376A" class="pginternal">376</a></span>For dogs are gentle to friends and fierce to strangers. Your dog
      is a philosopher who judges by the rule of knowing or not knowing; and
      philosophy, whether in man or beast, is the parent of gentleness. The
      human watchdogs must be philosophers or lovers of learning which will make
      them gentle. And how are they to be learned without education?
    </p>
<p>
      But what shall their education be? Is any better than the old-fashioned
      sort which is comprehended under the name of music and gymnastic? <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage377A" class="pginternal">377</a></span>Music
      includes literature, and literature is of two kinds, true and false. ‘What
      do you mean?’ he said. I mean that children hear stories before they learn
      gymnastics, and that the stories are either untrue, or have at most one or
      two grains of truth in a bushel of falsehood. Now early life is very
      impressible, and children ought not to learn what they will have to
      unlearn when they grow up; we must therefore have a censorship of nursery
      tales, banishing some and keeping others. Some of them are very improper,
      as we may see in the great instances of Homer and Hesiod, who not only
      tell lies but bad lies; stories about Uranus and Saturn, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage378A" class="pginternal">378</a></span>which are immoral
      as well as false, and which should never be spoken of to young persons, or
      indeed at all; or, if at all, then in a mystery, after the sacrifice, not
      of an Eleusinian pig, but of some unprocurable animal. Shall our youth be
      encouraged to beat their fathers by the example of Zeus, or our citizens
      be incited to quarrel by hearing or seeing representations of strife among
      the gods? Shall they listen to the narrative of Hephaestus binding his
      mother, and of Zeus sending him flying for helping her when she was
      beaten? Such tales may possibly have a mystical interpretation, but the
      young are incapable of understanding allegory. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage379A" class="pginternal">379</a></span>If any one asks what tales
      are to be allowed, we will answer that we are legislators and not
      book-makers; we only lay down the principles according to which books are
      to be written; to write them is the duty of others.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxxv"></a>xxxv</span> And our first principle is, that God must be represented as he is; not as
      the author of all things, but of good only. We will not suffer the poets
      to say that he is the steward of good and evil, or that he has two casks
      full of destinies;—or that Athene and Zeus incited Pandarus to break
      the treaty; or that <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage380A" class="pginternal">380</a></span>God caused the sufferings of Niobe, or of Pelops, or
      the Trojan war; or that he makes men sin when he wishes to destroy them.
      Either these were not the actions of the gods, or God was just, and men
      were the better for being punished. But that the deed was evil, and God
      the author, is a wicked, suicidal fiction which we will allow no one, old
      or young, to utter. This is our first and great principle—God is the
      author of good only.
    </p>
<p>
      And the second principle is like unto it:—With God is no
      variableness or change of form. Reason teaches us this; for if we suppose
      a change in God, he must be changed either by another or by himself. By
      another?—but the best works of nature and art <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage381A" class="pginternal">381</a></span>and the noblest
      qualities of mind are least liable to be changed by any external force. By
      himself?—but he cannot change for the better; he will hardly change
      for the worse. He remains for ever fairest and best in his own image.
      Therefore we refuse to listen to the poets who tell us of Here begging in
      the likeness of a priestess or of other deities who prowl about at night
      in strange disguises; all that blasphemous nonsense with which mothers
      fool the manhood out of their children must be suppressed. But <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage382A" class="pginternal">382</a></span>some one
      will say that God, who is himself unchangeable, may take a form in
      relation to us. Why should he? For gods as well as men hate the lie in the
      soul, or principle of falsehood; and as for any other form of lying which
      is used for a purpose and is regarded as innocent in certain exceptional
      cases—what need have the gods of this? For they are not ignorant of
      antiquity like the poets, nor are they afraid of their enemies, nor is any
      madman a friend of theirs. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage383A" class="pginternal">383</a></span>God then is true, he is absolutely true; he
      changes not, he deceives not, by day or night, by word or sign. This is
      our second great principle—God is true. Away with the lying dream of
      Agamemnon in Homer, and the accusation of Thetis against Apollo in
      Aeschylus….

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic II.</i><br>I<span class="smcap">NTRODUCTION.</span></span>
      In order to give clearness to his conception of the State, Plato proceeds
      to trace the first principles of mutual need and of <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxxvi"></a>xxxvi</span> division of labour in
      an imaginary community of four or five citizens. Gradually this community
      increases; the division of labour extends to countries; imports
      necessitate exports; a medium of exchange is required, and retailers sit
      in the market-place to save the time of the producers. These are the steps
      by which Plato constructs the first or primitive State, introducing the
      elements of political economy by the way. As he is going to frame a second
      or civilized State, the simple naturally comes before the complex. He
      indulges, like Rousseau, in a picture of primitive life—an idea
      which has indeed often had a powerful influence on the imagination of
      mankind, but he does not seriously mean to say that one is better than the
      other (cp. Politicus, p. 272); nor can any inference be drawn from the description of
      the first state taken apart from the second, such as Aristotle appears to
      draw in the Politics, iv. 4, 12 (cp. again Politicus,
272). We should not interpret a Platonic dialogue any more
      than a poem or a parable in too literal or matter-of-fact a style. On the
      other hand, when we compare the lively fancy of Plato with the dried-up
      abstractions of modern treatises on philosophy, we are compelled to say
      with Protagoras, that the ‘mythus is more interesting’ (Protag. 320 D).
    </p>
<p>
      Several interesting remarks which in modern times would have a place in a
      treatise on Political Economy are scattered up and down the writings of
      Plato: cp. especially Laws,
v. 740, Population; viii. 847, Free Trade; xi. 916-7,
Adulteration; 923-4, Wills and Bequests; 930, Begging;
Eryxias, (though not Plato’s), Value and Demand; Republic,
ii. <a href="#stpage369A" class="pginternal">369</a> ff., Division of Labour. The last subject, and also the origin of
      Retail Trade, is treated with admirable lucidity in the second book of the
      Republic. But Plato never combined his economic ideas into a system, and
      never seems to have recognized that Trade is one of the great motive
      powers of the State and of the world. He would make retail traders only of
      the inferior sort of citizens (Rep. ii. <a href="#stpage371A" class="pginternal">371</a>; cp. Laws,
viii. 847), though he remarks, quaintly enough (Laws, ix.
918 D), that ‘if only the best men and the best women everywhere
      were compelled to keep taverns for a time or to carry on retail trade,
      etc., then we should knew how pleasant and agreeable all these things
      are.’
    </p>
<p>
      The disappointment of Glaucon at the ‘city of pigs,’ the ludicrous
      description of the ministers of luxury in the more refined <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxxvii"></a>xxxvii</span> State, and the
      afterthought of the necessity of doctors, the illustration of the nature
      of the guardian taken from the dog, the desirableness of offering some
      almost unprocurable victim when impure mysteries are to be celebrated, the
      behaviour of Zeus to his father and of Hephaestus to his mother, are
      touches of humour which have also a serious meaning. In speaking of
      education Plato rather startles us by affirming that a child must be
      trained in falsehood first and in truth afterwards. Yet this is not very
      different from saying that children must be taught through the medium of
      imagination as well as reason; that their minds can only develope
      gradually, and that there is much which they must learn without
      understanding (cp. iii. <a href="#stpage402A" class="pginternal">402 A</a>). This is also the substance of Plato’s view, though he must
      be acknowledged to have drawn the line somewhat differently from modern
      ethical writers, respecting truth and falsehood. To us, economies or
      accommodations would not be allowable unless they were required by the
      human faculties or necessary for the communication of knowledge to the
      simple and ignorant. We should insist that the word was inseparable from
      the intention, and that we must not be ‘falsely true,’ i.e. speak or act
      falsely in support of what was right or true. But Plato would limit the
      use of fictions only by requiring that they should have a good moral
      effect, and that such a dangerous weapon as falsehood should be employed
      by the rulers alone and for great objects.
    </p>
<p>
      A Greek in the age of Plato attached no importance to the question whether
      his religion was an historical fact. He was just beginning to be conscious
      that the past had a history; but he could see nothing beyond Homer and
      Hesiod. Whether their narratives were true or false did not seriously
      affect the political or social life of Hellas. Men only began to suspect
      that they were fictions when they recognised them to be immoral. And so in
      all religions: the consideration of their morality comes first, afterwards
      the truth of the documents in which they are recorded, or of the events
      natural or supernatural which are told of them. But in modern times, and
      in Protestant countries perhaps more than in Catholic, we have been too
      much inclined to identify the historical with the moral; and some have
      refused to believe in religion at all, unless a superhuman accuracy was
      discernible in every part of the record. The facts of an ancient <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxxviii"></a>xxxviii</span> or
      religious history are amongst the most important of all facts; but they
      are frequently uncertain, and we only learn the true lesson which is to be
      gathered from them when we place ourselves above them. These reflections
      tend to show that the difference between Plato and ourselves, though not
      unimportant, is not so great as might at first sight appear. For we should
      agree with him in placing the moral before the historical truth of
      religion; and, generally, in disregarding those errors or misstatements of
      fact which necessarily occur in the early stages of all religions. We know
      also that changes in the traditions of a country cannot be made in a day;
      and are therefore tolerant of many things which science and criticism
      would condemn.
    </p>
<p>
      We note in passing that the allegorical interpretation of mythology, said
      to have been first introduced as early as the sixth century before Christ
      by Theagenes of Rhegium, was well established in the age of Plato, and
      here, as in the Phaedrus (229–30), though for a different reason, was rejected by
      him. That anachronisms whether of religion or law, when men have reached
      another stage of civilization, should be got rid of by fictions is in
      accordance with universal experience. Great is the art of interpretation;
      and by a natural process, which when once discovered was always going on,
      what could not be altered was explained away. And so without any palpable
      inconsistency there existed side by side two forms of religion, the
      tradition inherited or invented by the poets and the customary worship of
      the temple; on the other hand, there was the religion of the philosopher,
      who was dwelling in the heaven of ideas, but did not therefore refuse to
      offer a cock to Æsculapius, or to be seen saying his prayers at the
      rising of the sun. At length the antagonism between the popular and
      philosophical religion, never so great among the Greeks as in our own age,
      disappeared, and was only felt like the difference between the religion of
      the educated and uneducated among ourselves. The Zeus of Homer and Hesiod
      easily passed into the ‘royal mind’ of Plato (Philebus, 28); the giant
      Heracles became the knight-errant and benefactor of mankind. These and
      still more wonderful transformations were readily effected by the
      ingenuity of Stoics and neo-Platonists in the two or three centuries
      before and after Christ. The Greek and Roman religions were gradually
      permeated by the spirit of philosophy; having lost their <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexxxix"></a>xxxix</span> ancient meaning,
      they were resolved into poetry and morality; and probably were never purer
      than at the time of their decay, when their influence over the world was
      waning.
    </p>
<p>
      A singular conception which occurs towards the end of the book is the lie
      in the soul; this is connected with the Platonic and Socratic doctrine
      that involuntary ignorance is worse than voluntary. The lie in the soul is
      a true lie, the corruption of the highest truth, the deception of the
      highest part of the soul, from which he who is deceived has no power of
      delivering himself. For example, to represent God as false or immoral, or,
      according to Plato, as deluding men with appearances or as the author of
      evil; or again, to affirm with Protagoras that ‘knowledge is sensation,’
      or that ‘being is becoming,’ or with Thrasymachus ‘that might is right,’
      would have been regarded by Plato as a lie of this hateful sort. The
      greatest unconsciousness of the greatest untruth, e.g. if, in the language
      of the Gospels (John iv. 41), ‘he who was blind’ were to say ‘I see,’ is another
      aspect of the state of mind which Plato is describing. The lie in the soul
      may be further compared with the sin against the Holy Ghost (Luke xii. 10),
      allowing for the difference between Greek and Christian modes of speaking.
      To this is opposed the lie in words, which is only such a deception as may
      occur in a play or poem, or allegory or figure of speech, or in any sort
      of accommodation,—which though useless to the gods may be useful to
      men in certain cases. Socrates is here answering the question which he had
      himself raised (i. <a href="#stpage331C" class="pginternal">331 C</a>) about the propriety of deceiving a madman; and he is also
      contrasting the nature of God and man. For God is Truth, but mankind can
      only be true by appearing sometimes to be partial, or false. Reserving for
      another place the greater questions of religion or education, we may note
      further, (1) the approval of the old traditional education of Greece; (2)
      the preparation which Plato is making for the attack on Homer and the
      poets; (3) the preparation which he is also making for the use of
      economies in the State; (4) the contemptuous and at the same time
      euphemistic manner in which here as below (iii. <a href="#stpage390A" class="pginternal">390</a>) he alludes to the <i>Chronique
      Scandaleuse</i> of the gods.
    </p>
<p> </p>
<p id="iaIII"><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic III.</i><br>A<span class="smcap">NALYSIS.</span></span>
<b>BOOK III.</b> <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage386A" class="pginternal">386</a></span>There is another motive in purifying religion, which is to
      banish fear; for no man can be courageous who is <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexl"></a>xl</span> afraid of death, or who
      believes the tales which are repeated by the poets concerning the world
      below. They must be gently requested not to abuse hell; they may be
      reminded that their stories are both untrue and discouraging. Nor must
      they be angry if we expunge obnoxious passages, such as the depressing
      words of Achilles—‘I would rather be a serving-man than rule over
      all the dead;’ and the verses which tell of the squalid mansions, the
      senseless shadows, the flitting soul mourning over lost strength and
      youth, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage387A" class="pginternal">387</a></span>the soul with a gibber going beneath the earth like smoke, or the
      souls of the suitors which flutter about like bats. The terrors and
      horrors of Cocytus and Styx, ghosts and sapless shades, and the rest of
      their Tartarean nomenclature, must vanish. Such tales may have their use;
      but they are not the proper food for soldiers. As little can we admit the
      sorrows and sympathies of the Homeric heroes:—Achilles, the son of
      Thetis, in tears, throwing ashes on his head, or pacing up and down the
      sea-shore in distraction; or Priam, the cousin of the gods, crying aloud,
      rolling in the mire. A good man is not prostrated at the loss of children
      or fortune. Neither is death terrible to him; and therefore lamentations
      over the dead should not be practised by men of note; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage388A" class="pginternal">388</a></span>they should be the
      concern of inferior persons only, whether women or men. Still worse is the
      attribution of such weakness to the gods; as when the goddesses say,
      ‘Alas! my travail!’ and worst of all, when the king of heaven himself
      laments his inability to save Hector, or sorrows over the impending doom
      of his dear Sarpedon. Such a character of God, if not ridiculed by our
      young men, is likely to be imitated by them. Nor should our citizens be
      given to excess of laughter—‘Such violent delights’ are followed by
      a violent re-action. The description in the Iliad of the gods shaking
      their sides at the clumsiness of Hephaestus will not be admitted by us.
      ‘Certainly not.’
    </p>
<p>
      Truth should have a high place among the virtues, for falsehood, as we
      were saying, is useless to the gods, and only useful to men as a medicine.
      But this employment of falsehood must remain a privilege of state; the
      common man must not in return tell a lie to the ruler; any more than the
      patient would tell a lie to his physician, or the sailor to his captain.
    </p>
<p>
      In the next place our youth must be temperate, and temperance consists in
      self-control and obedience to authority. That is a <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexli"></a>xli</span> lesson which Homer
      teaches in some places: ‘The Achaeans marched on breathing prowess, in
      silent awe of their leaders;’—but a very different one in other
      places: ‘O heavy with wine, who hast the eyes of a dog, but the heart of a
      stag.’ <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage390A" class="pginternal">390</a></span>Language of the latter kind will not impress self-control on the
      minds of youth. The same may be said about his praises of eating and
      drinking and his dread of starvation; also about the verses in which he
      tells of the rapturous loves of Zeus and Here, or of how Hephaestus once
      detained Ares and Aphrodite in a net on a similar occasion. There is a
      nobler strain heard in the words:—‘Endure, my soul, thou hast
      endured worse.’ Nor must we allow our citizens to receive bribes, or to
      say, ‘Gifts persuade the gods, gifts reverend kings;’ or to applaud the
      ignoble advice of Phoenix to Achilles that he should get money out of the
      Greeks before he assisted them; or the meanness of Achilles himself in
      taking gifts from Agamemnon; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage391A" class="pginternal">391</a></span>or his requiring a ransom for the body of
      Hector; or his cursing of Apollo; or his insolence to the river-god
      Scamander; or his dedication to the dead Patroclus of his own hair which
      had been already dedicated to the other river-god Spercheius; or his
      cruelty in dragging the body of Hector round the walls, and slaying the
      captives at the pyre: such a combination of meanness and cruelty in
      Cheiron’s pupil is inconceivable. The amatory exploits of Peirithous and
      Theseus are equally unworthy. Either these so-called sons of gods were not
      the sons of gods, or they were not such as the poets imagine them, any
      more than the gods themselves are the authors of evil. The youth who
      believes that such things are done by <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage392A" class="pginternal">392</a></span>those who have the blood of heaven
      flowing in their veins will be too ready to imitate their example.
    </p>
<p>
      Enough of gods and heroes;—what shall we say about men? What the
      poets and story-tellers say—that the wicked prosper and the
      righteous are afflicted, or that justice is another’s gain? Such
      misrepresentations cannot be allowed by us. But in this we are
      anticipating the definition of justice, and had therefore better defer the
      enquiry.
    </p>
<p>
      The subjects of poetry have been sufficiently treated; next follows style.
      Now all poetry is a narrative of events past, present, or to come; and
      narrative is of three kinds, the simple, the imitative, and a composition
      of the two. An instance will <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexlii"></a>xlii</span> make my meaning clear. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage393A" class="pginternal">393</a></span>The first scene in
      Homer is of the last or mixed kind, being partly description and partly
      dialogue. But if you throw the dialogue into the ‘oratio obliqua,’ the
      passage will run thus: <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage394A" class="pginternal">394</a></span>The priest came and prayed Apollo that the Achaeans
      might take Troy and have a safe return if Agamemnon would only give him
      back his daughter; and the other Greeks assented, but Agamemnon was wroth,
      and so on—The whole then becomes descriptive, and the poet is the
      only speaker left; or, if you omit the narrative, the whole becomes
      dialogue. These are the three styles—which of them is to be admitted
      into our State? ‘Do you ask whether tragedy and comedy are to be
      admitted?’ Yes, but also something more—Is it not doubtful whether
      our guardians are to be imitators at all? Or rather, has not the question
      been already answered, for we have decided that one man cannot in his life
      play many parts, any more than <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage395A" class="pginternal">395</a></span>he can act both tragedy and comedy, or be
      rhapsodist and actor at once? Human nature is coined into very small
      pieces, and as our guardians have their own business already, which is the
      care of freedom, they will have enough to do without imitating. If they
      imitate they should imitate, not any meanness or baseness, but the good
      only; for the mask which the actor wears is apt to become his face. We
      cannot allow men to play the parts of women, quarrelling, weeping,
      scolding, or boasting against the gods,—least of all when making
      love or in labour. They must not represent slaves, or bullies, or <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage396A" class="pginternal">396</a></span>cowards,
      drunkards, or madmen, or blacksmiths, or neighing horses, or bellowing
      bulls, or sounding rivers, or a raging sea. A good or wise man will be
      willing to perform good and wise actions, but he will be ashamed to play
      an inferior part which he has never practised; and he will prefer to
      employ the descriptive style with as little imitation as possible. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage397A" class="pginternal">397</a></span>The man
      who has no self-respect, on the contrary, will imitate anybody and
      anything; sounds of nature and cries of animals alike; his whole
      performance will be imitation of gesture and voice. Now in the descriptive
      style there are few changes, but in the dramatic there are a great many.
      Poets and musicians use either, or a compound of both, and this compound
      is very attractive to youth and their teachers as well as to the vulgar.
      But our State in which one man plays one part only is not adapted for
      complexity. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage398A" class="pginternal">398</a></span>And when one of these polyphonous pantomimic gentlemen offers
      to exhibit <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexliii"></a>xliii</span> himself and his poetry we will show him every observance of
      respect, but at the same time tell him that there is no room for his kind
      in our State; we prefer the rough, honest poet, and will not depart from
      our original models (ii. <a href="#stpage379A" class="pginternal">379</a> foll.; cp. Laws, vii. 817).
    </p>
<p>
      Next as to the music. A song or ode has three parts,—the subject,
      the harmony, and the rhythm; of which the two last are dependent upon the
      first. As we banished strains of lamentation, so we may now banish the
      mixed Lydian harmonies, which are the harmonies of lamentation; and as our
      citizens are to be temperate, we may also banish convivial harmonies, such
      as the Ionian and pure Lydian. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage399A" class="pginternal">399</a></span>Two remain—the Dorian and Phrygian,
      the first for war, the second for peace; the one expressive of courage,
      the other of obedience or instruction or religious feeling. And as we
      reject varieties of harmony, we shall also reject the many-stringed,
      variously-shaped instruments which give utterance to them, and in
      particular the flute, which is more complex than any of them. The lyre and
      the harp may be permitted in the town, and the Pan’s-pipe in the fields.
      Thus we have made a purgation of music, and will now make a purgation of
      metres. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage400A" class="pginternal">400</a></span>These should be like the harmonies, simple and suitable to the
      occasion. There are four notes of the tetrachord, and there are three
      ratios of metre, <span class="smcap"><sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>, <span class="smcap"><sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>, <span class="smcap"><sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>1</sub></span>, which have all their characteristics, and
      the feet have different characteristics as well as the rhythms. But about
      this you and I must ask Damon, the great musician, who speaks, if I
      remember rightly, of a martial measure as well as of dactylic, trochaic,
      and iambic rhythms, which he arranges so as to equalize the syllables with
      one another, assigning to each the proper quantity. We only venture to
      affirm the general principle that the style is to conform to the subject
      and the metre to the style; and that the simplicity and harmony of the
      soul should be reflected in them all. This principle of simplicity has to
      be learnt by every one in the days of his youth, and <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage401A" class="pginternal">401</a></span>may be gathered
      anywhere, from the creative and constructive arts, as well as from the
      forms of plants and animals.
    </p>
<p>
      Other artists as well as poets should be warned against meanness or
      unseemliness. Sculpture and painting equally with music must conform to
      the law of simplicity. He who violates it cannot be allowed to work in our
      city, and to corrupt the taste of our citizens. For our guardians must
      grow up, not amid images of <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexliv"></a>xliv</span> deformity which will gradually poison and
      corrupt their souls, but in a land of health and beauty where they will
      drink in from every object sweet and harmonious influences. And of all
      these influences the greatest is the education given by music, which finds
      a way into the innermost soul and <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage402A" class="pginternal">402</a></span>imparts to it the sense of beauty and of
      deformity. At first the effect is unconscious; but when reason arrives,
      then he who has been thus trained welcomes her as the friend whom he
      always knew. As in learning to read, first we acquire the elements or
      letters separately, and afterwards their combinations, and cannot
      recognize reflections of them until we know the letters themselves;—in
      like manner we must first attain the elements or essential forms of the
      virtues, and then trace their combinations in life and experience. There
      is a music of the soul which answers to the harmony of the world; and the
      fairest object of a musical soul is the fair mind in the fair body. Some
      defect in the latter may be excused, but not in the former. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage403A" class="pginternal">403</a></span>True love is
      the daughter of temperance, and temperance is utterly opposed to the
      madness of bodily pleasure. Enough has been said of music, which makes a
      fair ending with love.
    </p>
<p>
      Next we pass on to gymnastics; about which I would remark, that the soul
      is related to the body as a cause to an effect, and therefore if we
      educate the mind we may leave the education of the body in her charge, and
      need only give a general outline of the course to be pursued. In the first
      place the guardians must abstain from strong drink, for they should be the
      last persons to lose their wits. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage404A" class="pginternal">404</a></span>Whether the habits of the palaestra are
      suitable to them is more doubtful, for the ordinary gymnastic is a sleepy
      sort of thing, and if left off suddenly is apt to endanger health. But our
      warrior athletes must be wide-awake dogs, and must also be inured to all
      changes of food and climate. Hence they will require a simpler kind of
      gymnastic, akin to their simple music; and for their diet a rule may be
      found in Homer, who feeds his heroes on roast meat only, and gives them no
      fish although they are living at the sea-side, nor boiled meats which
      involve an apparatus of pots and pans; and, if I am not mistaken, he
      nowhere mentions sweet sauces. Sicilian cookery and Attic confections and
      Corinthian courtezans, which are to gymnastic what Lydian and Ionian
      melodies are to music, must be forbidden. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage405A" class="pginternal">405</a></span>Where gluttony and intemperance
      prevail the town quickly fills <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexlv"></a>xlv</span> with doctors and pleaders; and law and
      medicine give themselves airs as soon as the freemen of a State take an
      interest in them. But what can show a more disgraceful state of education
      than to have to go abroad for justice because you have none of your own at
      home? And yet there <em>is</em> a worse stage of the same disease—when men
      have learned to take a pleasure and pride in the twists and turns of the
      law; not considering how much better it would be for them so to order
      their lives as to have no need of a nodding justice. And there is a like
      disgrace in employing a physician, not for the cure of wounds or epidemic
      disorders, but because a man has by laziness and luxury contracted
      diseases which were unknown in the days of Asclepius. How simple is the
      Homeric practice of medicine. Eurypylus after he has been wounded <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage406A" class="pginternal">406</a></span>drinks a
      posset of Pramnian wine, which is of a heating nature; and yet the sons of
      Asclepius blame neither the damsel who gives him the drink, nor Patroclus
      who is attending on him. The truth is that this modern system of nursing
      diseases was introduced by Herodicus the trainer; who, being of a sickly
      constitution, by a compound of training and medicine tortured first
      himself and then a good many other people, and lived a great deal longer
      than he had any right. But Asclepius would not practise this art, because
      he knew that the citizens of a well-ordered State have no leisure to be
      ill, and therefore he adopted the ‘kill or cure’ method, which artisans
      and labourers employ. ‘They must be at their business,’ they say, ‘and
      have no time for coddling: if they recover, well; if they don’t, there is
      an end of them.’ <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage407A" class="pginternal">407</a></span>Whereas the rich man is supposed to be a gentleman who
      can afford to be ill. Do you know a maxim of Phocylides—that ‘when a
      man begins to be rich’ (or, perhaps, a little sooner) ‘he should practise
      virtue’? But how can excessive care of health be inconsistent with an
      ordinary occupation, and yet consistent with that practice of virtue which
      Phocylides inculcates? When a student imagines that philosophy gives him a
      headache, he never does anything; he is always unwell. This was the reason
      why Asclepius and his sons practised no such art. They were acting in the
      interest of the public, and did not wish to preserve useless lives, or
      raise up a puny offspring to wretched sires. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage408A" class="pginternal">408</a></span>Honest diseases they honestly
      cured; and if a man was wounded, they applied the proper remedies, and
      then let him eat and drink what he liked. But <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexlvi"></a>xlvi</span> they declined to treat
      intemperate and worthless subjects, even though they might have made large
      fortunes out of them. As to the story of Pindar, that Asclepius was slain
      by a thunderbolt for restoring a rich man to life, that is a lie—following
      our old rule we must say either that he did not take bribes, or that he
      was not the son of a god.
    </p>
<p>
      Glaucon then asks Socrates whether the best physicians and the best judges
      will not be those who have had severally the greatest experience of
      diseases and of crimes. Socrates draws a distinction between the two
      professions. The physician should have had experience of disease in his
      own body, for he cures with his mind and not with his body. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage409A" class="pginternal">409</a></span>But the judge
      controls mind by mind; and therefore his mind should not be corrupted by
      crime. Where then is he to gain experience? How is he to be wise and also
      innocent? When young a good man is apt to be deceived by evil-doers,
      because he has no pattern of evil in himself; and therefore the judge
      should be of a certain age; his youth should have been innocent, and he
      should have acquired insight into evil not by the practice of it, but by
      the observation of it in others. This is the ideal of a judge; the
      criminal turned detective is wonderfully suspicious, but when in company
      with good men who have experience, he is at fault, for he foolishly
      imagines that every one is as bad as himself. Vice may be known of virtue,
      but cannot know virtue. This is the sort of medicine and this the sort of
      law which will prevail in our State; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage410A" class="pginternal">410</a></span>they will be healing arts to better
      natures; but the evil body will be left to die by the one, and the evil
      soul will be put to death by the other. And the need of either will be
      greatly diminished by good music which will give harmony to the soul, and
      good gymnastic which will give health to the body. Not that this division
      of music and gymnastic really corresponds to soul and body; for they are
      both equally concerned with the soul, which is tamed by the one and
      aroused and sustained by the other. The two together supply our guardians
      with their twofold nature. The passionate disposition when it has too much
      gymnastic is hardened and brutalized, the gentle or philosophic temper
      which has too much music becomes enervated. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage411A" class="pginternal">411</a></span>While a man is allowing music
      to pour like water through the funnel of his ears, the edge of his soul
      gradually wears away, and the passionate or spirited element is melted out
      of him. Too little <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexlvii"></a>xlvii</span> spirit is easily exhausted; too much quickly passes
      into nervous irritability. So, again, the athlete by feeding and training
      has his courage doubled, but he soon grows stupid; he is like a wild
      beast, ready to do everything by blows and nothing by counsel or policy.
      There are two principles in man, reason and passion, and to these, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage412A" class="pginternal">412</a></span>not to
      the soul and body, the two arts of music and gymnastic correspond. He who
      mingles them in harmonious concord is the true musician,—he shall be
      the presiding genius of our State.
    </p>
<p>
      The next question is, Who are to be our rulers? First, the elder must rule
      the younger; and the best of the elders will be the best guardians. Now
      they will be the best who love their subjects most, and think that they
      have a common interest with them in the welfare of the state. These we
      must select; but they must be watched at every epoch of life to see
      whether they have retained the same opinions and held out against force
      and enchantment. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage413A" class="pginternal">413</a></span>For time and persuasion and the love of pleasure may
      enchant a man into a change of purpose, and the force of grief and pain
      may compel him. And therefore our guardians must be men who have been
      tried by many tests, like gold in the refiner’s fire, and have been passed
      first through danger, then through pleasure, and at every age have come
      out of such trials victorious and without stain, in full command of
      themselves and their principles; having all their faculties in harmonious
      exercise for their country’s good. These shall receive the highest honours
      both in life and death. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage414A" class="pginternal">414</a></span>(It would perhaps be better to confine the term
      ‘guardians’ to this select class: the younger men may be called
      ‘auxiliaries.’)
    </p>
<p>
      And now for one magnificent lie, in the belief of which, Oh that we could
      train our rulers!—at any rate let us make the attempt with the rest
      of the world. What I am going to tell is only another version of the
      legend of Cadmus; but our unbelieving generation will be slow to accept
      such a story. The tale must be imparted, first to the rulers, then to the
      soldiers, lastly to the people. We will inform them that their youth was a
      dream, and that during the time when they seemed to be undergoing their
      education they were really being fashioned in the earth, who sent them up
      when they were ready; and that they must protect and cherish her whose
      children they are, and regard <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexlviii"></a>xlviii</span> each other as brothers and sisters. ‘I do
      not wonder at your being ashamed to propound such a fiction.’ There is
      more behind. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage415A" class="pginternal">415</a></span>These brothers and sisters have different natures, and some
      of them God framed to rule, whom he fashioned of gold; others he made of
      silver, to be auxiliaries; others again to be husbandmen and craftsmen,
      and these were formed by him of brass and iron. But as they are all sprung
      from a common stock, a golden parent may have a silver son, or a silver
      parent a golden son, and then there must be a change of rank; the son of
      the rich must descend, and the child of the artisan rise, in the social
      scale; for an oracle says ‘that the State will come to an end if governed
      by a man of brass or iron.’ Will our citizens ever believe all this? ‘Not
      in the present generation, but in the next, perhaps, Yes.’
    </p>
<p>
      Now let the earthborn men go forth under the command of their rulers, and
      look about and pitch their camp in a high place, which will be safe
      against enemies from without, and likewise against insurrections from
      within. There let them sacrifice and set up their tents; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage416A" class="pginternal">416</a></span>for soldiers they
      are to be and not shopkeepers, the watchdogs and guardians of the sheep;
      and luxury and avarice will turn them into wolves and tyrants. Their
      habits and their dwellings should correspond to their education. They
      should have no property; their pay should only meet their expenses; and
      they should have common meals. Gold and silver we will tell them that they
      have from God, and this divine gift in their souls they must not <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage417A" class="pginternal">417</a></span>alloy
      with that earthly dross which passes under the name of gold. They only of
      the citizens may not touch it, or be under the same roof with it, or drink
      from it; it is the accursed thing. Should they ever acquire houses or
      lands or money of their own, they will become householders and tradesmen
      instead of guardians, enemies and tyrants instead of helpers, and the hour
      of ruin, both to themselves and the rest of the State, will be at hand.
    </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic III.</i><br>I<span class="smcap">NTRODUCTION.</span></span>
      The religious and ethical aspect of Plato’s education will hereafter be
      considered under a separate head. Some lesser points may be more
      conveniently noticed in this place.
    </p>
<p>
      1. The constant appeal to the authority of Homer, whom, with grave irony,
      Plato, after the manner of his age, summons as a <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexlix"></a>xlix</span> witness about ethics and
      psychology, as well as about diet and medicine; attempting to distinguish
      the better lesson from the worse (<a href="#stpage390A" class="pginternal">390</a>), sometimes altering the text
from design (<a href="#stpage388A" class="pginternal">388</a>, and, perhaps, <a href="#stpage389A" class="pginternal">389</a>); more than once
quoting or alluding to Homer inaccurately (<a href="#stpage391A" class="pginternal">391</a>, <a href="#stpage406A" class="pginternal">406</a>), after
the manner of the early logographers turning the Iliad into
prose (<a href="#stpage393A" class="pginternal">393</a>), and delighting to draw far-fetched inferences
from his words, or to make ludicrous applications of them.
He does not, like Heracleitus, get into a rage with Homer
and Archilochus (Heracl. Frag. 119, ed. Bywater), but uses their words and expressions as
      vehicles of a higher truth; not on a system like Theagenes of Rhegium or
      Metrodorus, or in later times the Stoics, but as fancy may dictate. And
      the conclusions drawn from them are sound, although the premises are
      fictitious. These fanciful appeals to Homer add a charm to Plato’s style,
      and at the same time they have the effect of a satire on the follies of
      Homeric interpretation. To us (and probably to himself), although they
      take the form of arguments, they are really figures of speech. They may be
      compared with modern citations from Scripture, which have often a great
      rhetorical power even when the original meaning of the words is entirely
      lost sight of. The real, like the Platonic Socrates, as we gather from the
      Memorabilia of Xenophon, was fond of making similar adaptations (i. 2, 58;
ii. 6, 11). Great in
      all ages and countries, in religion as well as in law and literature, has
      been the art of interpretation.
    </p>
<p>
      2. ‘The style is to conform to the subject and the metre to the style.’
      Notwithstanding the fascination which the word ‘classical’ exercises over
      us, we can hardly maintain that this rule is observed in all the Greek
      poetry which has come down to us. We cannot deny that the thought often
      exceeds the power of lucid expression in Æschylus and Pindar; or that
      rhetoric gets the better of the thought in the Sophist-poet Euripides.
      Only perhaps in Sophocles is there a perfect harmony of the two; in him
      alone do we find a grace of language like the beauty of a Greek statue, in
      which there is nothing to add or to take away; at least this is true of
      single plays or of large portions of them. The connection in the Tragic
      Choruses and in the Greek lyric poets is not unfrequently a tangled thread
      which in an age before logic the poet was unable to draw out. Many
      thoughts and feelings mingled in his mind, and he had no power of
      disengaging or <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagel"></a>l</span> arranging them. For there is a subtle influence of logic
      which requires to be transferred from prose to poetry, just as the music
      and perfection of language are infused by poetry into prose. In all ages
      the poet has been a bad judge of his own meaning (Apol. 22 B); for he does not
      see that the word which is full of associations to his own mind is
      difficult and unmeaning to that of another; or that the sequence which is
      clear to himself is puzzling to others. There are many passages in some of
      our greatest modern poets which are far too obscure; in which there is no
      proportion between style and subject, in which any half-expressed figure,
      any harsh construction, any distorted collocation of words, any remote
      sequence of ideas is admitted; and there is no voice ‘coming sweetly from
      nature,’ or music adding the expression of feeling to thought. As if there
      could be poetry without beauty, or beauty without ease and clearness. The
      obscurities of early Greek poets arose necessarily out of the state of
      language and logic which existed in their age. They are not examples to be
      followed by us; for the use of language ought in every generation to
      become clearer and clearer. Like <span class="correction" title="amended from Shakespere">Shakespeare</span>, they were great in spite, not
      in consequence, of their imperfections of expression. But there is no
      reason for returning to the necessary obscurity which prevailed in the
      infancy of literature. The English poets of the last century were
      certainly not obscure; and we have no excuse for losing what they had
      gained, or for going back to the earlier or transitional age which
      preceded them. The thought of our own times has not out-stripped language;
      a want of Plato’s ‘art of measuring’ is the real cause of the
      disproportion between them.
    </p>
<p>
      3. In the third book of the Republic a nearer approach is made to a theory
      of art than anywhere else in Plato. His views may be summed up as follows:—True
      art is not fanciful and imitative, but simple and ideal,—the
      expression of the highest moral energy, whether in action or repose. To
      live among works of plastic art which are of this noble and simple
      character, or to listen to such strains, is the best of influences,—the
      true Greek atmosphere, in which youth should be brought up. That is the
      way to create in them a natural good taste, which will have a feeling of
      truth and beauty in all things. For though the poets are to be expelled,
      still art is recognized as another aspect of <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageli"></a>li</span> reason—like love in the
      Symposium, extending over the same sphere, but confined to the preliminary
      education, and acting through the power of habit (vii. <a href="#stpage522A" class="pginternal">522 A</a>); and this conception of
      art is not limited to strains of music or the forms of plastic art, but
      pervades all nature and has a wide kindred in the world. The Republic of
      Plato, like the Athens of Pericles, has an artistic as well as a political
      side.
    </p>
<p>
      There is hardly any mention in Plato of the creative arts; only in two or
      three passages does he even allude to them (cp. Rep. iv. <a href="#stpage420A" class="pginternal">420</a>; Soph. 236 A). He is not lost
      in rapture at the great works of Phidias, the Parthenon, the Propylea, the
      statues of Zeus or Athene. He would probably have regarded any abstract
      truth of number or figure (<a href="#stpage529E" class="pginternal">529 E</a>) as higher than the greatest of them. Yet it is
      hard to suppose that some influence, such as he hopes to inspire in youth,
      did not pass into his own mind from the works of art which he saw around
      him. We are living upon the fragments of them, and find in a few broken
      stones the standard of truth and beauty. But in Plato this feeling has no
      expression; he nowhere says that beauty is the object of art; he seems to
      deny that wisdom can take an external form (Phaedrus, 250 E); he does not
      distinguish the fine from the mechanical arts. Whether or no, like some
      writers, he felt more than he expressed, it is at any rate remarkable that
      the greatest perfection of the fine arts should coincide with an almost
      entire silence about them. In one very striking passage he tells us that a
      work of art, like the State, is a whole; and this conception of a whole
      and the love of the newly-born mathematical sciences may be regarded, if
      not as the inspiring, at any rate as the regulating principles of Greek
      art (cp. Xen. Mem. iii. 10. 6;
and Sophist, 235, 236).
    </p>
<p>
      4. Plato makes the true and subtle remark that the physician had better
      not be in robust health; and should have known what illness is in his own
      person. But the judge ought to have had no similar experience of evil; he
      is to be a good man who, having passed his youth in innocence, became
      acquainted late in life with the vices of others. And therefore, according
      to Plato, a judge should not be young, just as a young man according to
      Aristotle is not fit to be a hearer of moral philosophy. The bad, on the
      other hand, have a knowledge of vice, but no knowledge <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelii"></a>lii</span> of virtue. It may
      be doubted, however, whether this train of reflection is well founded. In
      a remarkable passage of the Laws (xii. 950 B) it is acknowledged that the evil may form
      a correct estimate of the good. The union of gentleness and courage in
      Book ii. at first seemed to be a paradox, yet was afterwards ascertained
      to be a truth. And Plato might also have found that the intuition of evil
      may be consistent with the abhorrence of it (cp. infra, ix. <a href="#stpage582A" class="pginternal">582</a>). There is a directness of aim
      in virtue which gives an insight into vice. And the knowledge of character
      is in some degree a natural sense independent of any special experience of
      good or evil.
    </p>
<p>
      5. One of the most remarkable conceptions of Plato, because un-Greek and
      also very different from anything which existed at all in his age of the
      world, is the transposition of ranks. In the Spartan state there had been
      enfranchisement of Helots and degradation of citizens under special
      circumstances. And in the ancient Greek aristocracies, merit was certainly
      recognized as one of the elements on which government was based. The
      founders of states were supposed to be their benefactors, who were raised
      by their great actions above the ordinary level of humanity; at a later
      period, the services of warriors and legislators were held to entitle them
      and their descendants to the privileges of citizenship and to the first
      rank in the state. And although the existence of an ideal aristocracy is
      slenderly proven from the remains of early Greek history, and we have a
      difficulty in ascribing such a character, however the idea may be defined,
      to any actual Hellenic state—or indeed to any state which has ever
      existed in the world—still the rule of the best was certainly the
      aspiration of philosophers, who probably accommodated a good deal their
      views of primitive history to their own notions of good government. Plato
      further insists on applying to the guardians of his state a series of
      tests by which all those who fell short of a fixed standard were either
      removed from the governing body, or not admitted to it; and this
      ‘academic’ discipline did to a certain extent prevail in Greek states,
      especially in Sparta. He also indicates that the system of caste, which
      existed in a great part of the ancient, and is by no means extinct in the
      modern European world, should be set aside from time to time in favour of
      merit. He is aware how deeply the greater part of <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageliii"></a>liii</span> mankind resent any
      interference with the order of society, and therefore he proposes his
      novel idea in the form of what he himself calls a ‘monstrous fiction.’
      (Compare the ceremony of preparation for the two ‘great waves’ in Book v.)
      Two principles are indicated by him: first, that there is a distinction of
      ranks dependent on circumstances prior to the individual: second, that
      this distinction is and ought to be broken through by personal qualities.
      He adapts mythology like the Homeric poems to the wants of the state,
      making ‘the Phoenician tale’ the vehicle of his ideas. Every Greek state
      had a myth respecting its own origin; the Platonic republic may also have
      a tale of earthborn men. The gravity and verisimilitude with which the
      tale is told, and the analogy of Greek tradition, are a sufficient
      verification of the ‘monstrous falsehood.’ Ancient poetry had spoken of a
      gold and silver and brass and iron age succeeding one another, but Plato
      supposes these differences in the natures of men to exist together in a
      single state. Mythology supplies a figure under which the lesson may be
      taught (as Protagoras says, ‘the myth is more interesting’), and also
      enables Plato to touch lightly on new principles without going into
      details. In this passage he shadows forth a general truth, but he does not
      tell us by what steps the transposition of ranks is to be effected. Indeed
      throughout the Republic he allows the lower ranks to fade into the
      distance. We do not know whether they are to carry arms, and whether in
      the fifth book they are or are not included in the communistic regulations
      respecting property and marriage. Nor is there any use in arguing strictly
      either from a few chance words, or from the silence of Plato, or in
      drawing inferences which were beyond his vision. Aristotle, in his
      criticism on the position of the lower classes, does not perceive that the
      poetical creation is ‘like the air, invulnerable,’ and cannot be
      penetrated by the shafts of his logic (Pol. 2, 5,
18 foll.).
    </p>
<p>
      6. Two paradoxes which strike the modern reader as in the highest degree
      fanciful and ideal, and which suggest to him many reflections, are to be
      found in the third book of the Republic: first, the great power of music,
      so much beyond any influence which is experienced by us in modern times,
      when the art or science has been far more developed, and has found <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageliv"></a>liv</span> the
      secret of harmony, as well as of melody; secondly, the indefinite and
      almost absolute control which the soul is supposed to exercise over the
      body.
    </p>
<p>
      In the first we suspect some degree of exaggeration, such as we may also
      observe among certain masters of the art, not unknown to us, at the
      present day. With this natural enthusiasm, which is felt by a few only,
      there seems to mingle in Plato a sort of Pythagorean reverence for numbers
      and numerical proportion to which Aristotle is a stranger. Intervals of
      sound and number are to him sacred things which have a law of their own,
      not dependent on the variations of sense. They rise above sense, and
      become a connecting link with the world of ideas. But it is evident that
      Plato is describing what to him appears to be also a fact. The power of a
      simple and characteristic melody on the impressible mind of the Greek is
      more than we can easily appreciate. The effect of national airs may bear
      some comparison with it. And, besides all this, there is a confusion
      between the harmony of musical notes and the harmony of soul and body,
      which is so potently inspired by them.
    </p>
<p>
      The second paradox leads up to some curious and interesting questions—How
      far can the mind control the body? Is the relation between them one of
      mutual antagonism or of mutual harmony? Are they two or one, and is either
      of them the cause of the other? May we not at times drop the opposition
      between them, and the mode of describing them, which is so familiar to us,
      and yet hardly conveys any precise meaning, and try to view this composite
      creature, man, in a more simple manner? Must we not at any rate admit that
      there is in human nature a higher and a lower principle, divided by no
      distinct line, which at times break asunder and take up arms against one
      another? Or again, they are reconciled and move together, either
      unconsciously in the ordinary work of life, or consciously in the pursuit
      of some noble aim, to be attained not without an effort, and for which
      every thought and nerve are strained. And then the body becomes the good
      friend or ally, or servant or instrument of the mind. And the mind has
      often a wonderful and almost superhuman power of banishing disease and
      weakness and calling out a hidden strength. Reason and the desires, the
      intellect and the senses are brought into harmony and obedience so as to
      form a <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelv"></a>lv</span> single human being. They are ever parting, ever meeting; and the
      identity or diversity of their tendencies or operations is for the most
      part unnoticed by us. When the mind touches the body through the
      appetites, we acknowledge the responsibility of the one to the other.
      There is a tendency in us which says ‘Drink.’ There is another which says,
      ‘Do not drink; it is not good for you.’ And we all of us know which is the
      rightful superior. We are also responsible for our health, although into
      this sphere there enter some elements of necessity which may be beyond our
      control. Still even in the management of health, care and thought,
      continued over many years, may make us almost free agents, if we do not
      exact too much of ourselves, and if we acknowledge that all human freedom
      is limited by the laws of nature and of mind.
    </p>
<p>
      We are disappointed to find that Plato, in the general condemnation which
      he passes on the practice of medicine prevailing in his own day,
      depreciates the effects of diet. He would like to have diseases of a
      definite character and capable of receiving a definite treatment. He is
      afraid of invalidism interfering with the business of life. He does not
      recognize that time is the great healer both of mental and bodily
      disorders; and that remedies which are gradual and proceed little by
      little are safer than those which produce a sudden catastrophe. Neither
      does he see that there is no way in which the mind can more surely
      influence the body than by the control of eating and drinking; or any
      other action or occasion of human life on which the higher freedom of the
      will can be more simple or truly asserted.
    </p>
<p>
      7. Lesser matters of style may be remarked. (1) The affected ignorance of music, which is Plato’s way of expressing
      that he is passing lightly over the subject. (2) The tentative manner in which here, as in the second book, he proceeds
      with the construction of the State. (3) The description of the State sometimes as a reality (<a href="#stpage389D" class="pginternal">389 D</a>; <a href="#stpage416B" class="pginternal">416 B</a>), and then again
as a work of imagination only (cp. <a href="#stpage534C" class="pginternal">534 C</a>; <a href="#stpage592B" class="pginternal">592 B</a>); these are
the arts by which he sustains the reader’s interest. (4) Connecting links (e.g. <a href="#stpage408C" class="pginternal">408 C</a> with <a href="#stpage379A" class="pginternal">379</a>), or the preparation
(<a href="#stpage394D" class="pginternal">394 D</a>) for the entire expulsion of the poets in Book x. (5) The companion pictures of the lover of litigation and the
      valetudinarian (<a href="#stpage405A" class="pginternal">405</a>), the satirical jest about the maxim of Phocylides (<a href="#stpage407A" class="pginternal">407</a>), the
      manner in which <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelvi"></a>lvi</span> the image of the gold and silver citizens is taken up into
      the subject (<a href="#stpage416E" class="pginternal">416 E</a>), and the argument from the practice of Asclepius (<a href="#stpage407A" class="pginternal">407</a>), should not
      escape notice.
    </p>
<p> </p>
<p id="iaIV"><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic IV.</i><br>A<span class="smcap">NALYSIS.</span></span>
<b>BOOK IV.</b> <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage419A" class="pginternal">419</a></span>Adeimantus said: ‘Suppose a person to argue, Socrates, that you
      make your citizens miserable, and this by their own free-will; they are
      the lords of the city, and yet instead of having, like other men, lands
      and houses and money of their own, they live as mercenaries and are always
      mounting guard.’ <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage420A" class="pginternal">420</a></span>You may add, I replied, that they receive no pay but only
      their food, and have no money to spend on a journey or a mistress. ‘Well,
      and what answer do you give?’ My answer is, that our guardians may or may
      not be the happiest of men,—I should not be surprised to find in the
      long-run that they were,—but this is not the aim of our
      constitution, which was designed for the good of the whole and not of any
      one part. If I went to a sculptor and blamed him for having painted the
      eye, which is the noblest feature of the face, not purple but black, he
      would reply: ‘The eye must be an eye, and you should look at the statue as
      a whole.’ ‘Now I can well imagine a fool’s paradise, in which everybody is
      eating and drinking, clothed in purple and fine linen, and potters lie on
      sofas and have their wheel at hand, that they may work a little when they
      please; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage421A" class="pginternal">421</a></span>and cobblers and all the other classes of a State lose their
      distinctive character. And a State may get on without cobblers; but when
      the guardians degenerate into boon companions, then the ruin is complete.
      Remember that we are not talking of peasants keeping holiday, but of a
      State in which every man is expected to do his own work. The happiness
      resides not in this or that class, but in the State as a whole. I have
      another remark to make:—A middle condition is best for artisans;
      they should have money enough to buy tools, and not enough to be
      independent of business. And will not the same condition be best for our
      citizens? If they are poor, they will be mean; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage422A" class="pginternal">422</a></span>if rich, luxurious and
      lazy; and in neither case contented. ‘But then how will our poor city be
      able to go to war against an enemy who has money?’ There may be a
      difficulty in fighting against one enemy; against two there will be none.
      In the first place, the contest will be <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelvii"></a>lvii</span> carried on by trained warriors
      against well-to-do citizens: and is not a regular athlete an easy match
      for two stout opponents at least? Suppose also, that before engaging we
      send ambassadors to one of the two cities, saying, ‘Silver and gold we
      have not; do you help us and take our share of the spoil;’—who would
      fight against the lean, wiry dogs, when they might join with them in
      preying upon the fatted sheep? ‘But if many states join their resources,
      shall we not be in danger?’ I am amused to hear you use the word ‘state’
      of any but our own State. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage423A" class="pginternal">423</a></span>They are ‘states,’ but not ‘a state’—many
      in one. For in every state there are two hostile nations, rich and poor,
      which you may set one against the other. But our State, while she remains
      true to her principles, will be in very deed the mightiest of Hellenic
      states.
    </p>
<p>
      To the size of the state there is no limit but the necessity of unity; it
      must be neither too large nor too small to be one. This is a matter of
      secondary importance, like the principle of transposition which was
      intimated in the parable of the earthborn men. The meaning there implied
      was that every man should do that for which he was fitted, and be at one
      with himself, and then the whole city would be united. But all these
      things are secondary, if education, which is the great matter, be duly
      regarded. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage424A" class="pginternal">424</a></span>When the wheel has once been set in motion, the speed is always
      increasing; and each generation improves upon the preceding, both in
      physical and moral qualities. The care of the governors should be directed
      to preserve music and gymnastic from innovation; alter the songs of a
      country, Damon says, and you will soon end by altering its laws. The
      change appears innocent at first, and begins in play; but the evil soon
      becomes serious, working secretly upon the characters of individuals, then
      upon social and commercial relations, and lastly upon the institutions of
      a state; and there is ruin and confusion everywhere. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage425A" class="pginternal">425</a></span>But if education
      remains in the established form, there will be no danger. A restorative
      process will be always going on; the spirit of law and order will raise up
      what has fallen down. Nor will any regulations be needed for the lesser
      matters of life—rules of deportment or fashions of dress. Like
      invites like for good or for evil. Education will correct deficiencies and
      supply the power of self-government. Far be it from us to enter into the
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelviii"></a>lviii</span> particulars of legislation; let the guardians take care of education, and
      education will take care of all other things.
    </p>
<p>
      But without education they may patch and mend as they please; they will
      make no progress, any more than a patient who thinks to cure himself by
      some favourite remedy and will not give up his luxurious mode of living.
      <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage426A" class="pginternal">426</a></span>If you tell such persons that they must first alter their habits, then
      they grow angry; they are charming people. ‘Charming,—nay, the very
      reverse.’ Evidently these gentlemen are not in your good graces, nor the
      state which is like them. And such states there are which first ordain
      under penalty of death that no one shall alter the constitution, and then
      suffer themselves to be flattered into and out of anything; and he who
      indulges them and fawns upon them, is their leader and saviour. ‘Yes, the
      men are as bad as the states.’ But do you not admire their cleverness?
      ‘Nay, some of them are stupid enough to believe what the people tell
      them.’ And when all the world is telling a man that he is six feet high,
      and he has no measure, how can he believe anything else? But don’t get
      into a passion: to see our statesmen trying their nostrums, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage427A" class="pginternal">427</a></span>and fancying
      that they can cut off at a blow the Hydra-like rogueries of mankind, is as
      good as a play. Minute enactments are superfluous in good states, and are
      useless in bad ones.
    </p>
<p>
      And now what remains of the work of legislation? Nothing for us; but to
      Apollo the god of Delphi we leave the ordering of the greatest of all
      things—that is to say, religion. Only our ancestral deity sitting
      upon the centre and navel of the earth will be trusted by us if we have
      any sense, in an affair of such magnitude. No foreign god shall be supreme
      in our realms….
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic IV.</i><br>I<span class="smcap">NTRODUCTION.</span></span>
      Here, as Socrates would say, let us ‘reflect on’ (<span class="transl" title="skopô=men">σκοπῶμεν</span>) what has
      preceded: thus far we have spoken not of the happiness of the citizens,
      but only of the well-being of the State. They may be the happiest of men,
      but our principal aim in founding the State was not to make them happy.
      They were to be guardians, not holiday-makers. In this pleasant manner is
      presented to us the famous question both of ancient and modern philosophy,
      touching the relation of duty to happiness, of right to utility.
    </p>
<p>
      First duty, then happiness, is the natural order of our moral ideas. The
      utilitarian principle is valuable as a corrective of <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelix"></a>lix</span> error, and shows to
      us a side of ethics which is apt to be neglected. It may be admitted
      further that right and utility are co-extensive, and that he who makes the
      happiness of mankind his object has one of the highest and noblest motives
      of human action. But utility is not the historical basis of morality; nor
      the aspect in which moral and religious ideas commonly occur to the mind.
      The greatest happiness of all is, as we believe, the far-off result of the
      divine government of the universe. The greatest happiness of the
      individual is certainly to be found in a life of virtue and goodness. But
      we seem to be more assured of a law of right than we can be of a divine
      purpose, that ‘all mankind should be saved;’ and we infer the one from the
      other. And the greatest happiness of the individual may be the reverse of
      the greatest happiness in the ordinary sense of the term, and may be
      realised in a life of pain, or in a voluntary death. Further, the word
      ‘happiness’ has several ambiguities; it may mean either pleasure or an
      ideal life, happiness subjective or objective, in this world or in
      another, of ourselves only or of our neighbours and of all men everywhere.
      By the modern founder of Utilitarianism the self-regarding and
      disinterested motives of action are included under the same term, although
      they are commonly opposed by us as benevolence and self-love. The word
      happiness has not the definiteness or the sacredness of ‘truth’ and
      ‘right’; it does not equally appeal to our higher nature, and has not sunk
      into the conscience of mankind. It is associated too much with the
      comforts and conveniences of life; too little with ‘the goods of the soul
      which we desire for their own sake.’ In a great trial, or danger, or
      temptation, or in any great and heroic action, it is scarcely thought of.
      For these reasons ‘the greatest happiness’ principle is not the true
      foundation of ethics. But though not the first principle, it is the
      second, which is like unto it, and is often of easier application. For the
      larger part of human actions are neither right nor wrong, except in so far
      as they tend to the happiness of mankind (cp. Introd. to Gorgias and
      Philebus).
    </p>
<p>
      The same question reappears in politics, where the useful or expedient
      seems to claim a larger sphere and to have a greater authority. For
      concerning political measures, we chiefly ask: How will they affect the
      happiness of mankind? Yet here too we may observe that what we term
      expediency is merely the law of <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelx"></a>lx</span> right limited by the conditions of human
      society. Right and truth are the highest aims of government as well as of
      individuals; and we ought not to lose sight of them because we cannot
      directly enforce them. They appeal to the better mind of nations; and
      sometimes they are too much for merely temporal interests to resist. They
      are the watchwords which all men use in matters of public policy, as well
      as in their private dealings; the peace of Europe may be said to depend
      upon them. In the most commercial and utilitarian states of society the
      power of ideas remains. And all the higher class of statesmen have in them
      something of that idealism which Pericles is said to have gathered from
      the teaching of Anaxagoras. They recognise that the true leader of men
      must be above the motives of ambition, and that national character is of
      greater value than material comfort and prosperity. And this is the order
      of thought in Plato; first, he expects his citizens to do their duty, and
      then under favourable circumstances, that is to say, in a well-ordered
      State, their happiness is assured. That he was far from excluding the
      modern principle of utility in politics is sufficiently evident from other
      passages; in which ‘the most beneficial is affirmed to be the most
      honourable’ (v. <a href="#stpage457B" class="pginternal">457 B</a>), and also ‘the most sacred’ (v. <a href="#stpage458E" class="pginternal">458 E</a>).
    </p>
<p>
      We may note
         (1) The manner in which the objection of Adeimantus here, as in ii. <a href="#stpage357A" class="pginternal">357</a> foll., <a href="#stpage363A" class="pginternal">363</a>; <a href="#BookVI" class="pginternal">vi.</a> ad init., etc., is designed to
      draw out and deepen the argument of Socrates.

      (2) The conception of a whole as lying at the foundation both of politics
      and of art, in the latter supplying the only principle of criticism,
      which, under the various names of harmony, symmetry, measure, proportion,
      unity, the Greek seems to have applied to works of art.

      (3) The requirement that the State should be limited in size, after the
      traditional model of a Greek state; as in the Politics of Aristotle (vii. 4,
etc.), the
      fact that the cities of Hellas were small is converted into a principle.

      (4) The humorous pictures of the lean dogs and the fatted sheep, of the
      light active boxer upsetting two stout gentlemen at least, of the
      ‘charming’ patients who are always making themselves worse; or again, the
      playful assumption that there is no State but our own; or the grave irony
      with which the statesman is excused who believes that he is six feet high
      because he is told so, and having nothing to measure with is to be
      pardoned for his ignorance—he is too <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxi"></a>lxi</span> amusing for us to be seriously
      angry with him.

      (5) The light and superficial manner in which religion is passed over when
      provision has been made for two great principles,—first, that
      religion shall be based on the highest conception of the gods (ii. <a href="#stpage377A" class="pginternal">377</a> foll.), secondly,
      that the true national or Hellenic type shall be maintained….
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic IV.</i><br>A<span class="smcap">NALYSIS.</span></span>
      Socrates proceeds: But where amid all this is justice? Son of Ariston,
      tell me where. Light a candle and search the city, and get your brother
      and the rest of our friends to help in seeking for her. ‘That won’t do,’
      replied Glaucon, ‘you yourself promised to make the search and talked
      about the impiety of deserting justice.’ Well, I said, I will lead the
      way, but do you follow. My notion is, that our State being perfect will
      contain all the four virtues—wisdom, courage, temperance, justice.
      <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage428A" class="pginternal">428</a></span>If we eliminate the three first, the unknown remainder will be justice.
    </p>
<p>
      First then, of wisdom: the State which we have called into being will be
      wise because politic. And policy is one among many kinds of skill,—not
      the skill of the carpenter, or of the worker in metal, or of the
      husbandman, but the skill of him who advises about the interests of the
      whole State. Of such a kind is the skill of the guardians, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage429A" class="pginternal">429</a></span>who are a small
      class in number, far smaller than the blacksmiths; but in them is
      concentrated the wisdom of the State. And if this small ruling class have
      wisdom, then the whole State will be wise.
    </p>
<p>
      Our second virtue is courage, which we have no difficulty in finding in
      another class—that of soldiers. Courage may be defined as a sort of
      salvation—the never-failing salvation of the opinions which law and
      education have prescribed concerning dangers. You know the way in which
      dyers first prepare the white ground and then lay on the dye of purple or
      of any other colour. Colours dyed in this way become fixed, and no soap or
      lye will ever wash them out. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage430A" class="pginternal">430</a></span>Now the ground is education, and the laws are
      the colours; and if the ground is properly laid, neither the soap of
      pleasure nor the lye of pain or fear will ever wash them out. This power
      which preserves right opinion about danger I would ask you to call
      ‘courage,’ adding the epithet ‘political’ or ‘civilized’ in order to
      distinguish it from mere animal courage and from a higher courage which
      may hereafter be discussed.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxii"></a>lxii</span> Two virtues remain; temperance and justice. More than the preceding
      virtues <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage431A" class="pginternal">431</a></span>temperance suggests the idea of harmony. Some light is thrown upon
      the nature of this virtue by the popular description of a man as ‘master
      of himself’—which has an absurd sound, because the master is also
      the servant. The expression really means that the better principle in a
      man masters the worse. There are in cities whole classes—women,
      slaves and the like—who correspond to the worse, and a few only to
      the better; and in our State the former class are held under control by
      the latter. Now to which of these classes does temperance belong? ‘To both
      of them.’ And our State if any will be the abode of temperance; and we
      were right in describing this virtue as a harmony which is diffused
      through the whole, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage432A" class="pginternal">432</a></span>making the dwellers in the city to be of one mind, and
      attuning the upper and middle and lower classes like the strings of an
      instrument, whether you suppose them to differ in wisdom, strength or
      wealth.

<p>
      And now we are near the spot; let us draw in and surround the cover and
      watch with all our eyes, lest justice should slip away and escape. Tell
      me, if you see the thicket move first. ‘Nay, I would have you lead.’ Well
      then, offer up a prayer and follow. The way is dark and difficult; but we
      must push on. I begin to see a track. ‘Good news.’ Why, Glaucon, our
      dulness of scent is quite ludicrous! While we are straining our eyes into
      the distance, justice is tumbling out at our feet. We are as bad as people
      looking for a thing which they have in their hands. Have you forgotten our
      <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage433A" class="pginternal">433</a></span>old principle of the division of labour, or of every man doing his own
      business, concerning which we spoke at the foundation of the State—what
      but this was justice? Is there any other virtue remaining which can
      compete with wisdom and temperance and courage in the scale of political
      virtue? For ‘every one having his own’ is the great object of government;
      <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage434A" class="pginternal">434</a></span>and the great object of trade is that every man should do his own
      business. Not that there is much harm in a carpenter trying to be a
      cobbler, or a cobbler transforming himself into a carpenter; but great
      evil may arise from the cobbler leaving his last and turning into a
      guardian or legislator, or when a single individual is trainer, warrior,
      legislator, all in one. And this evil is injustice, or every man doing
      another’s business. I do not say that as yet we are in a condition to
      arrive at a final conclusion. For the <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxiii"></a>lxiii</span> definition which we believe to hold
      good in states has still to be tested by the individual. Having read the
      large letters we will now come back to the small. From the two together a
      brilliant light may be struck out….

      Socrates proceeds to discover the nature of justice by a method of
      residues. Each of the first three virtues corresponds to one of the three
      parts of the soul and one of the three classes in the State, although the
      third, temperance, has more of the nature of a harmony than the first two.
      If there be a fourth virtue, that can only be sought for in the relation
      of the three parts in the soul or classes in the State to one another. It
      is obvious and simple, and for that very reason has not been found out.
      The modern logician will be inclined to object that ideas cannot be
      separated like chemical substances, but that they run into one another and
      may be only different aspects or names of the same thing, and such in this
      instance appears to be the case. For the definition here given of justice
      is verbally the same as one of the definitions of temperance given by
      Socrates in the Charmides (162 A), which however is only provisional, and is
      afterwards rejected. And so far from justice remaining over when the other
      virtues are eliminated, the justice and temperance of the Republic can
      with difficulty be distinguished. Temperance appears to be the virtue of a
      part only, and one of three, whereas justice is a universal virtue of the
      whole soul. Yet on the other hand temperance is also described as a sort
      of harmony, and in this respect is akin to justice. Justice seems to
      differ from temperance in degree rather than in kind; whereas temperance
      is the harmony of discordant elements, justice is the perfect order by
      which all natures and classes do their own business, the right man in the
      right place, the division and co-operation of all the citizens. Justice,
      again, is a more abstract notion than the other virtues, and therefore,
      from Plato’s point of view, the foundation of them, to which they are
      referred and which in idea precedes them. The proposal to omit temperance
      is a mere trick of style intended to avoid monotony (cp. vii. <a href="#stpage528A" class="pginternal">528</a>).
    </p>
<p>
      There is a famous question discussed in one of the earlier Dialogues of
      Plato (Protagoras, 329, 330; cp. Arist. Nic.
Ethics, vi. 13. 6), ‘Whether the virtues are one or
      many?’ This receives an answer which is to the effect that there are four
      cardinal virtues <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxiv"></a>lxiv</span> (now for the first time brought together in ethical
      philosophy), and one supreme over the rest, which is not like Aristotle’s
      conception of universal justice, virtue relative to others, but the whole
      of virtue relative to the parts. To this universal conception of justice
      or order in the first education and in the moral nature of man, the still
      more universal conception of the good in the second education and in the
      sphere of speculative knowledge seems to succeed. Both might be equally
      described by the terms ‘law,’ ‘order,’ ‘harmony;’ but while the idea of
      good embraces ‘all time and all existence,’ the conception of justice is
      not extended beyond man.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic IV.</i><br>A<span class="smcap">NALYSIS.</span></span>
      … Socrates is now going to identify the individual and the State. But
      first he must prove that there are three parts of the individual soul. His
      argument is as follows:—Quantity makes no difference in quality. The
      word ‘just,’ whether applied to the individual or to the State, has the
      same meaning. And the term ‘justice’ implied that the same three
      principles in the State and in the individual were doing their own
      business. But are they really three or one? The question is difficult, and
      one which can hardly be solved by the methods which we are now using; but
      the truer and longer way would take up too much of our time. ‘The shorter
      will satisfy me.’ Well then, you would admit that the qualities of states
      mean the qualities of the individuals who compose them? The Scythians and
      Thracians are passionate, our own race intellectual, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage436A" class="pginternal">436</a></span>and the Egyptians and
      Phoenicians covetous, because the individual members of each have such and
      such a character; the difficulty is to determine whether the several
      principles are one or three; whether, that is to say, we reason with one
      part of our nature, desire with another, are angry with another, or
      whether the whole soul comes into play in each sort of action. This
      enquiry, however, requires a very exact definition of terms. The same
      thing in the same relation cannot be affected in two opposite ways. But
      there is no impossibility in a man standing still, yet moving his arms, or
      in a top which is fixed on one spot going round upon its axis. There is no
      necessity to mention all the possible exceptions; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage437A" class="pginternal">437</a></span>let us provisionally
      assume that opposites cannot do or be or suffer opposites in the same
      relation. And to the class of opposites belong assent and dissent, desire
      and avoidance. And one form <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxv"></a>lxv</span> of desire is thirst and hunger: and here
      arises a new point—thirst is thirst of drink, hunger is hunger of
      food; not of warm drink or of a particular kind of food, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage438A" class="pginternal">438</a></span>with the single
      exception of course that the very fact of our desiring anything implies
      that it is good. When relative terms have no attributes, their
      correlatives have no attributes; when they have attributes, their
      correlatives also have them. For example, the term ‘greater’ is simply
      relative to ‘less,’ and knowledge refers to a subject of knowledge. But on
      the other hand, a particular knowledge is of a particular subject. Again,
      every science has a distinct character, which is defined by an object;
      medicine, for example, is the science of health, although not to be
      confounded with health. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage439A" class="pginternal">439</a></span>Having cleared our ideas thus far, let us return
      to the original instance of thirst, which has a definite object—drink.
      Now the thirsty soul may feel two distinct impulses; the animal one saying
      ‘Drink;’ the rational one, which says ‘Do not drink.’ The two impulses are
      contradictory; and therefore we may assume that they spring from distinct
      principles in the soul. But is passion a third principle, or akin to
      desire? There is a story of a certain Leontius which throws some light on
      this question. He was coming up from the Piraeus outside the north wall,
      and he passed a spot where there were dead bodies lying by the
      executioner. He felt a longing desire to see them and also an abhorrence
      of them; at first he turned away and shut his eyes, then, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage440A" class="pginternal">440</a></span>suddenly tearing
      them open, he said,—‘Take your fill, ye wretches, of the fair
      sight.’ Now is there not here a third principle which is often found to
      come to the assistance of reason against desire, but never of desire
      against reason? This is passion or spirit, of the separate existence of
      which we may further convince ourselves by putting the following case:—When
      a man suffers justly, if he be of a generous nature he is not indignant at
      the hardships which he undergoes: but when he suffers unjustly, his
      indignation is his great support; hunger and thirst cannot tame him; the
      spirit within him must do or die, until the voice of the shepherd, that
      is, of reason, bidding his dog bark no more, is heard within. This shows
      that passion is the ally of reason. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage441A" class="pginternal">441</a></span>Is passion then the same with reason?
      No, for the former exists in children and brutes; and Homer affords a
      proof of the distinction between them when he says, ‘He smote his breast,
      and thus rebuked his soul.’
    </p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxvi"></a>lxvi</span> And now, at last, we have reached firm ground, and are able to infer that
      the virtues of the State and of the individual are the same. For wisdom
      and courage and justice in the State are severally the wisdom and courage
      and justice in the individuals who form the State. Each of the three
      classes will do the work of its own class in the State, and each part in
      the individual soul; reason, the superior, and passion, the inferior, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage442A" class="pginternal">442</a></span>will
      be harmonized by the influence of music and gymnastic. The counsellor and
      the warrior, the head and the arm, will act together in the town of
      Mansoul, and keep the desires in proper subjection. The courage of the
      warrior is that quality which preserves a right opinion about dangers in
      spite of pleasures and pains. The wisdom of the counsellor is that small
      part of the soul which has authority and reason. The virtue of temperance
      is the friendship of the ruling and the subject principles, both in the
      State and in the individual. Of justice we have already spoken; and the
      notion already given of it may be confirmed by common instances. Will the
      just state or the just individual <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage443A" class="pginternal">443</a></span>steal, lie, commit adultery, or be
      guilty of impiety to gods and men? ‘No.’ And is not the reason of this
      that the several principles, whether in the state or in the individual, do
      their own business? And justice is the quality which makes just men and
      just states. Moreover, our old division of labour, which required that
      there should be one man for one use, was a dream or anticipation of what
      was to follow; and that dream has now been realized in justice, which
      begins by binding together the three chords of the soul, and then acts
      harmoniously in every relation of life. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage444A" class="pginternal">444</a></span>And injustice, which is the
      insubordination and disobedience of the inferior elements in the soul, is
      the opposite of justice, and is inharmonious and unnatural, being to the
      soul what disease is to the body; for in the soul as well as in the body,
      good or bad actions produce good or bad habits. And virtue is the health
      and beauty and well-being of the soul, and vice is the disease and
      weakness and deformity of the soul.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage445A" class="pginternal">445</a></span>Again the old question returns upon us: Is justice or injustice the more
      profitable? The question has become ridiculous. For injustice, like mortal
      disease, makes life not worth having. Come up with me to the hill which
      overhangs the city and look down upon the single form of virtue, and the
      infinite forms of vice, <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxvii"></a>lxvii</span> among which are four special ones, characteristic
      both of states and of individuals. And the state which corresponds to the
      single form of virtue is that which we have been describing, wherein
      reason rules under one of two names—monarchy and aristocracy. Thus
      there are five forms in all, both of states and of souls….
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic IV.</i><br>I<span class="smcap">NTRODUCTION.</span></span>
      In attempting to prove that the soul has three separate faculties, Plato
      takes occasion to discuss what makes difference of faculties. And the
      criterion which he proposes is difference in the working of the faculties.
      The same faculty cannot produce contradictory effects. But the path of
      early reasoners is beset by thorny entanglements, and he will not proceed
      a step without first clearing the ground. This leads him into a tiresome
      digression, which is intended to explain the nature of contradiction.
      First, the contradiction must be at the same time and in the same
      relation. Secondly, no extraneous word must be introduced into either of
      the terms in which the contradictory proposition is expressed: for
      example, thirst is of drink, not of warm drink. He implies, what he does
      not say, that if, by the advice of reason, or by the impulse of anger, a
      man is restrained from drinking, this proves that thirst, or desire under
      which thirst is included, is distinct from anger and reason. But suppose
      that we allow the term ‘thirst’ or ‘desire’ to be modified, and say an
      ‘angry thirst,’ or a ‘revengeful desire,’ then the two spheres of desire
      and anger overlap and become confused. This case therefore has to be
      excluded. And still there remains an exception to the rule in the use of
      the term ‘good,’ which is always implied in the object of desire. These
      are the discussions of an age before logic; and any one who is wearied by
      them should remember that they are necessary to the clearing up of ideas
      in the first development of the human faculties.
    </p>
<p>
      The psychology of Plato extends no further than the division of the soul
      into the rational, irascible, and concupiscent elements, which, as far as
      we know, was first made by him, and has been retained by Aristotle and
      succeeding ethical writers. The chief difficulty in this early analysis of
      the mind is to define exactly the place of the irascible faculty (<span class="transl" title="thumo/s">θυμός</span>),
      which may be variously described under the terms righteous indignation,
      spirit, passion. It is the foundation of courage, which includes in Plato
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxviii"></a>lxviii</span> moral courage, the courage of enduring pain, and of surmounting
      intellectual difficulties, as well as of meeting dangers in war. Though
      irrational, it inclines to side with the rational: it cannot be aroused by
      punishment when justly inflicted: it sometimes takes the form of an
      enthusiasm which sustains a man in the performance of great actions. It is
      the ‘lion heart’ with which the reason makes a treaty (ix. <a href="#stpage589B" class="pginternal">589 B</a>). On the other hand
      it is negative rather than positive; it is indignant at wrong or
      falsehood, but does not, like Love in the Symposium and Phaedrus, aspire
      to the vision of Truth or Good. It is the peremptory military spirit which
      prevails in the government of honour. It differs from anger (<span class="transl" title="o)rgê/">ὀργή</span>), this
      latter term having no accessory notion of righteous indignation. Although
      Aristotle has retained the word, yet we may observe that ‘passion’ (<span class="transl" title="thumo/s">θυμός</span>)
      has with him lost its affinity to the rational and has become
      indistinguishable from ‘anger’ (<span class="transl" title="o)rgê/">ὀργή</span>). And to this vernacular use Plato
      himself in the Laws seems to revert (ix. 836 B), though not always (v. 731 A). By modern
      philosophy too, as well as in our ordinary conversation, the words anger
      or passion are employed almost exclusively in a bad sense; there is no
      connotation of a just or reasonable cause by which they are aroused. The
      feeling of ‘righteous indignation’ is too partial and accidental to admit
      of our regarding it as a separate virtue or habit. We are tempted also to
      doubt whether Plato is right in supposing that an offender, however justly
      condemned, could be expected to acknowledge the justice of his sentence;
      this is the spirit of a philosopher or martyr rather than of a criminal.
    </p>
<p>
      We may observe (p. <a href="#stpage444D" class="pginternal">444 D</a>,  <a href="#stpage444D" class="pginternal">E</a>) how nearly Plato approaches Aristotle’s famous thesis, that
      ‘good actions produce good habits.’ The words ‘as healthy practices
      (<span class="transl" title="e)pitêdeu/mata">ἐπιτηδεύματα</span>) produce health, so do just practices produce justice,’ have a
      sound very like the Nicomachean Ethics. But we note also that an
      incidental remark in Plato has become a far-reaching principle in
      Aristotle, and an inseparable part of a great Ethical system.
    </p>
<p>
      There is a difficulty in understanding what Plato meant by ‘the longer
      way’ (<a href="#stpage435D" class="pginternal">435 D</a>; cp. <i>infra</i>, vi. <a href="#stpage504A" class="pginternal">504</a>): he seems to intimate some metaphysic of the future which will not be
      satisfied with arguing from the principle of contradiction. In the sixth
      and seventh books (compare Sophist and Parmenides) he has given <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxix"></a>lxix</span> us a
      sketch of such a metaphysic; but when Glaucon asks for the final
      revelation of the idea of good, he is put off with the declaration that he
      has not yet studied the preliminary sciences. How he would have filled up
      the sketch, or argued about such questions from a higher point of view, we
      can only conjecture. Perhaps he hoped to find some <i>a priori</i> method of
      developing the parts out of the whole; or he might have asked which of the
      ideas contains the other ideas, and possibly have stumbled on the Hegelian
      identity of the ‘ego’ and the ‘universal.’ Or he may have imagined that
      ideas might be constructed in some manner analogous to the construction of
      figures and numbers in the mathematical sciences. The most certain and
      necessary truth was to Plato the universal; and to this he was always
      seeking to refer all knowledge or opinion, just as in modern times we seek
      to rest them on the opposite pole of induction and experience. The
      aspirations of metaphysicians have always tended to pass beyond the limits
      of human thought and language: they seem to have reached a height at which
      they are ‘moving about in worlds unrealized,’ and their conceptions,
      although profoundly affecting their own minds, become invisible or
      unintelligible to others. We are not therefore surprized to find that
      Plato himself has nowhere clearly explained his doctrine of ideas; or that
      his school in a later generation, like his contemporaries Glaucon and
      Adeimantus, were unable to follow him in this region of speculation. In
      the Sophist, where he is refuting the scepticism which maintained either
      that there was no such thing as predication, or that all might be
      predicated of all, he arrives at the conclusion that some ideas combine
      with some, but not all with all. But he makes only one or two steps
      forward on this path; he nowhere attains to any connected system of ideas,
      or even to a knowledge of the most elementary relations of the sciences to
      one another (see <a href="#pagecix" class="pginternal"><i>infra</i></a>).
    </p>
<p> </p>
<p id="iaV"><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic V.</i><br>A<span class="smcap">NALYSIS.</span></span>
<b>BOOK V.</b> <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage449A" class="pginternal">449</a></span>I was going to enumerate the four forms of vice or decline in
      states, when Polemarchus—he was sitting a little farther from me
      than Adeimantus—taking him by the coat and leaning towards him, said
      something in an undertone, of which I only caught the words, ‘Shall we let
      him off?’ ‘Certainly not,’ said Adeimantus, raising his voice. Whom, I
      said, are you <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxx"></a>lxx</span> not going to let off? ‘You,’ he said. Why? ‘Because we think
      that you are not dealing fairly with us in omitting women and children, of
      whom you have slily disposed under the general formula that friends have
      all things in common.’ And was I not right? ‘Yes,’ he replied, ‘but there
      are many sorts of communism or community, and we want to know which of
      them is right. The company, as you have just heard, are resolved to have a
      further explanation.’ <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage450A" class="pginternal">450</a></span>Thrasymachus said, ‘Do you think that we have come
      hither to dig for gold, or to hear you discourse?’ Yes, I said; but the
      discourse should be of a reasonable length. Glaucon added, ‘Yes, Socrates,
      and there is reason in spending the whole of life in such discussions; but
      pray, without more ado, tell us how this community is to be carried out,
      and how the interval between birth and education is to be filled up.’
      Well, I said, the subject has several difficulties—What is possible?
      is the first question. What is desirable? is the second. ‘Fear not,’ he
      replied, ‘for you are speaking among friends.’ That, I replied, is a sorry
      consolation; I shall destroy my friends as well as myself. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage451A" class="pginternal">451</a></span>Not that I mind
      a little innocent laughter; but he who kills the truth is a murderer.
      ‘Then,’ said Glaucon, laughing, ‘in case you should murder us we will
      acquit you beforehand, and you shall be held free from the guilt of
      deceiving us.’
    </p>
<p>
      Socrates proceeds:—The guardians of our state are to be watch-dogs,
      as we have already said. Now dogs are not divided into hes and shes—we
      do not take the masculine gender out to hunt and leave the females at home
      to look after their puppies. They have the same employments—the only
      difference between them is that the one sex is stronger and the other
      weaker. But if women are to have the same employments as men, they must
      have the same education—they must be taught music and gymnastics,
      and the art of war. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage452A" class="pginternal">452</a></span>I know that a great joke will be made of their riding
      on horseback and carrying weapons; the sight of the naked old wrinkled
      women showing their agility in the palaestra will certainly not be a
      vision of beauty, and may be expected to become a famous jest. But we must
      not mind the wits; there was a time when they might have laughed at our
      present gymnastics. All is habit: people have at last found out that the
      exposure is better than the concealment of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxi"></a>lxxi</span> person, and now they laugh
      no more. Evil only should be the subject of ridicule.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage453A" class="pginternal">453</a></span>The first question is, whether women are able either wholly or partially
      to share in the employments of men. And here we may be charged with
      inconsistency in making the proposal at all. For we started originally
      with the division of labour; and the diversity of employments was based on
      the difference of natures. But is there no difference between men and
      women? Nay, are they not wholly different? <em>There</em> was the difficulty,
      Glaucon, which made me unwilling to speak of family relations. However,
      when a man is out of his depth, whether in a pool or in an ocean, he can
      only swim for his life; and we must try to find a way of escape, if we
      can.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage454A" class="pginternal">454</a></span>The argument is, that different natures have different uses, and the
      natures of men and women are said to differ. But this is only a verbal
      opposition. We do not consider that the difference may be purely nominal
      and accidental; for example, a bald man and a hairy man are opposed in a
      single point of view, but you cannot infer that because a bald man is a
      cobbler a hairy man ought not to be a cobbler. Now why is such an
      inference erroneous? Simply because the opposition between them is partial
      only, like the difference between a male physician and a female physician,
      not running through the whole nature, like the difference between a
      physician and a carpenter. And if the difference of the sexes is only that
      the one beget and the other bear children, this does not prove that they
      ought to have distinct educations. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage455A" class="pginternal">455</a></span>Admitting that women differ from men in
      capacity, do not men equally differ from one another? Has not nature
      scattered all the qualities which our citizens require indifferently up
      and down among the two sexes? and even in their peculiar pursuits, are not
      women often, though in some cases superior to men, ridiculously enough
      surpassed by them? Women are the same in kind as men, and have the same
      aptitude or want of aptitude for medicine or gymnastic or war, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage456A" class="pginternal">456</a></span>but in a
      less degree. One woman will be a good guardian, another not; and the good
      must be chosen to be the colleagues of our guardians. If however their
      natures are the same, the inference is that their education must also be
      the same; there is no longer anything unnatural or impossible in a woman
      learning music <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxii"></a>lxxii</span> and gymnastic. And the education which we give them will be
      the very best, far superior to that of cobblers, and will train up the
      very best women, and nothing can be more advantageous to the State than
      this. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage457A" class="pginternal">457</a></span>Therefore let them strip, clothed in their chastity, and share in
      the toils of war and in the defence of their country; he who laughs at
      them is a fool for his pains.
    </p>
<p>
      The first wave is past, and the argument is compelled to admit that men
      and women have common duties and pursuits. A second and greater wave is
      rolling in—community of wives and children; is this either expedient
      or possible? The expediency I do not doubt; I am not so sure of the
      possibility. ‘Nay, I think that a considerable doubt will be entertained
      on both points.’ I meant to have escaped the trouble of proving the first,
      but as you have detected the little stratagem I must even submit. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage458A" class="pginternal">458</a></span>Only
      allow me to feed my fancy like the solitary in his walks, with a dream of
      what might be, and then I will return to the question of what can be.
    </p>
<p>
      In the first place our rulers will enforce the laws and make new ones
      where they are wanted, and their allies or ministers will obey. You, as
      legislator, have already selected the men; and now you shall select the
      women. After the selection has been made, they will dwell in common houses
      and have their meals in common, and will be brought together by a
      necessity more certain than that of mathematics. But they cannot be
      allowed to live in licentiousness; that is an unholy thing, which the
      rulers are determined to prevent. For the avoidance of this, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage459A" class="pginternal">459</a></span>holy marriage
      festivals will be instituted, and their holiness will be in proportion to
      their usefulness. And here, Glaucon, I should like to ask (as I know that
      you are a breeder of birds and animals), Do you not take the greatest care
      in the mating? ‘Certainly.’ And there is no reason to suppose that less
      care is required in the marriage of human beings. But then our rulers must
      be skilful physicians of the State, for they will often need a strong dose
      of falsehood in order to bring about desirable unions between their
      subjects. The good must be paired with the good, and the bad with the bad,
      and the offspring of the one must be reared, and of the other destroyed;
      in this way the flock will be preserved in prime condition. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage460A" class="pginternal">460</a></span>Hymeneal
      festivals will be celebrated at times fixed with an eye to population, and
      the brides and bridegrooms will <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxiii"></a>lxxiii</span> meet at them; and by an ingenious system
      of lots the rulers will contrive that the brave and the fair come
      together, and that those of inferior breed are paired with inferiors—the
      latter will ascribe to chance what is really the invention of the rulers.
      And when children are born, the offspring of the brave and fair will be
      carried to an enclosure in a certain part of the city, and there attended
      by suitable nurses; the rest will be hurried away to places unknown. The
      mothers will be brought to the fold and will suckle the children; care
      however must be taken that none of them recognise their own offspring; and
      if necessary other nurses may also be hired. The trouble of watching and
      getting up at night will be transferred to attendants. ‘Then the wives of
      our guardians will have a fine easy time when they are having children.’
      And quite right too, I said, that they should.
    </p>
<p>
      The parents ought to be in the prime of life, which for a man may be
      reckoned at thirty years—from twenty-five, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage461A" class="pginternal">461</a></span>when he has ‘passed the
      point at which the speed of life is greatest,’ to fifty-five; and at
      twenty years for a woman—from twenty to forty. Any one above or
      below those ages who partakes in the hymeneals shall be guilty of impiety;
      also every one who forms a marriage connexion at other times without the
      consent of the rulers. This latter regulation applies to those who are
      within the specified ages, after which they may range at will, provided
      they avoid the prohibited degrees of parents and children, or of brothers
      and sisters, which last, however, are not absolutely prohibited, if a
      dispensation be procured. ‘But how shall we know the degrees of affinity,
      when all things are common?’ The answer is, that brothers and sisters are
      all such as are born seven or nine months after the espousals, and their
      parents those who are then espoused, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage462A" class="pginternal">462</a></span>and every one will have many children
      and every child many parents.
    </p>
<p>
      Socrates proceeds: I have now to prove that this scheme is advantageous
      and also consistent with our entire polity. The greatest good of a State
      is unity; the greatest evil, discord and distraction. And there will be
      unity where there are no private pleasures or pains or interests—where
      if one member suffers all the members suffer, if one citizen is touched
      all are quickly sensitive; and the least hurt to the little finger of the
      State runs through the whole body and vibrates to the soul. For the true
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxiv"></a>lxxiv</span> State, like an individual, is injured as a whole when any part is
      affected. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage463A" class="pginternal">463</a></span>Every State has subjects and rulers, who in a democracy are
      called rulers, and in other States masters: but in our State they are
      called saviours and allies; and the subjects who in other States are
      termed slaves, are by us termed nurturers and paymasters, and those who
      are termed comrades and colleagues in other places, are by us called
      fathers and brothers. And whereas in other States members of the same
      government regard one of their colleagues as a friend and another as an
      enemy, in our State no man is a stranger to another; for every citizen is
      connected with every other by ties of blood, and these names and this way
      of speaking will have a corresponding reality—brother, father,
      sister, mother, repeated from infancy in the ears of children, will not be
      mere words. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage464A" class="pginternal">464</a></span>Then again the citizens will have all things in common, in
      having common property they will have common pleasures and pains.
    </p>
<p>
      Can there be strife and contention among those who are of one mind; or
      lawsuits about property when men have nothing but their bodies which they
      call their own; or suits about violence when every one is bound to defend
      himself? <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage465A" class="pginternal">465</a></span>The permission to strike when insulted will be an ‘antidote’ to
      the knife and will prevent disturbances in the State. But no younger man
      will strike an elder; reverence will prevent him from laying hands on his
      kindred, and he will fear that the rest of the family may retaliate.
      Moreover, our citizens will be rid of the lesser evils of life; there will
      be no flattery of the rich, no sordid household cares, no borrowing and
      not paying. Compared with the citizens of other States, ours will be
      Olympic victors, and crowned with blessings greater still—they and
      their children having a better maintenance during life, and after death an
      honourable burial. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage466A" class="pginternal">466</a></span>Nor has the happiness of the individual been sacrificed
      to the happiness of the State (cp. iv. <a href="#stpage419E" class="pginternal">419 E</a>); our Olympic victor has not been turned into
      a cobbler, but he has a happiness beyond that of any cobbler. At the same
      time, if any conceited youth begins to dream of appropriating the State to
      himself, he must be reminded that ‘half is better than the whole.’ ‘I
      should certainly advise him to stay where he is when he has the promise of
      such a brave life.’
    </p>
<p>
      But is such a community possible?—as among the animals, so <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxv"></a>lxxv</span> also
      among men; and if possible, in what way possible? About war there is no
      difficulty; the principle of communism is adapted to military service.
      Parents will take their children to look on at a battle, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage467A" class="pginternal">467</a></span>just as potters’
      boys are trained to the business by looking on at the wheel. And to the
      parents themselves, as to other animals, the sight of their young ones
      will prove a great incentive to bravery. Young warriors must learn, but
      they must not run into danger, although a certain degree of risk is worth
      incurring when the benefit is great. The young creatures should be placed
      under the care of experienced veterans, and they should have wings—that
      is to say, swift and tractable steeds on which they may fly away and
      escape. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage468A" class="pginternal">468</a></span>One of the first things to be done is to teach a youth to ride.
    </p>
<p>
      Cowards and deserters shall be degraded to the class of husbandmen;
      gentlemen who allow themselves to be taken prisoners, may be presented to
      the enemy. But what shall be done to the hero? First of all he shall be
      crowned by all the youths in the army; secondly, he shall receive the
      right hand of fellowship; and thirdly, do you think that there is any harm
      in his being kissed? We have already determined that he shall have more
      wives than others, in order that he may have as many children as possible.
      And at a feast he shall have more to eat; we have the authority of Homer
      for honouring brave men with ‘long chines,’ which is an appropriate
      compliment, because meat is a very strengthening thing. Fill the bowl
      then, and give the best seats and meats to the brave—may they do
      them good! And he who dies in battle will be at once declared to be of the
      golden race, and will, as we believe, become one of Hesiod’s guardian
      angels. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage469A" class="pginternal">469</a></span>He shall be worshipped after death in the manner prescribed by the
      oracle; and not only he, but all other benefactors of the State who die in
      any other way, shall be admitted to the same honours.
    </p>
<p>
      The next question is, How shall we treat our enemies? Shall Hellenes be
      enslaved? No; for there is too great a risk of the whole race passing
      under the yoke of the barbarians. Or shall the dead be despoiled?
      Certainly not; for that sort of thing is an excuse for skulking, and has
      been the ruin of many an army. There is meanness and feminine malice in
      making an enemy of the dead body, when the soul which was the owner has
      fled—<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxvi"></a>lxxvi</span>like a dog who cannot reach his assailants, and quarrels with
      the stones which are thrown at him instead. Again, the arms of Hellenes
      should not be offered up in the temples of the Gods; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage470A" class="pginternal">470</a></span>they are a pollution,
      for they are taken from brethren. And on similar grounds there should be a
      limit to the devastation of Hellenic territory—the houses should not
      be burnt, nor more than the annual produce carried off. For war is of two
      kinds, civil and foreign; the first of which is properly termed ‘discord,’
      and only the second ‘war;’ and war between Hellenes is in reality civil
      war—a quarrel in a family, which is ever to be regarded as
      unpatriotic and unnatural, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage471A" class="pginternal">471</a></span>and ought to be prosecuted with a view to
      reconciliation in a true phil-Hellenic spirit, as of those who would
      chasten but not utterly enslave. The war is not against a whole nation who
      are a friendly multitude of men, women, and children, but only against a
      few guilty persons; when they are punished peace will be restored. That is
      the way in which Hellenes should war against one another—and against
      barbarians, as they war against one another now.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘But, my dear Socrates, you are forgetting the main question: Is such a
      State possible? I grant all and more than you say about the blessedness of
      being one family—fathers, brothers, mothers, daughters, going out to
      war together; but I want to ascertain the possibility of this ideal
      State.’ You are too unmerciful. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage472A" class="pginternal">472</a></span>The first wave and the second wave I have
      hardly escaped, and now you will certainly drown me with the third. When
      you see the towering crest of the wave, I expect you to take pity. ‘Not a
      whit.’
    </p>
<p>
      Well, then, we were led to form our ideal polity in the search after
      justice, and the just man answered to the just State. Is this ideal at all
      the worse for being impracticable? Would the picture of a perfectly
      beautiful man be any the worse because no such man ever lived? Can any
      reality come up to the idea? Nature will not allow words to be fully
      realized; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage473A" class="pginternal">473</a></span>but if I am to try and realize the ideal of the State in a
      measure, I think that an approach may be made to the perfection of which I
      dream by one or two, I do not say slight, but possible changes in the
      present constitution of States. I would reduce them to a single one—the
      great wave, as I call it. <em>Until, then, kings are philosophers, or
      philosophers are kings, cities will never cease from ill: no, nor the</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxvii"></a>lxxvii</span> <em>human race; nor will our ideal polity ever come into being.</em> I know that
      this is a hard saying, which few will be able to receive. ‘Socrates, all
      the world will take off his coat and rush upon you with sticks and stones,
      <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage474A" class="pginternal">474</a></span>and therefore I would advise you to prepare an answer.’ You got me into
      the scrape, I said. ‘And I was right,’ he replied; ‘however, I will stand
      by you as a sort of do-nothing, well-meaning ally.’ Having the help of
      such a champion, I will do my best to maintain my position. And first, I
      must explain of whom I speak and what sort of natures these are who are to
      be philosophers and rulers. As you are a man of pleasure, you will not
      have forgotten how indiscriminate lovers are in their attachments; they
      love all, and turn blemishes into beauties. The snub-nosed youth is said
      to have a winning grace; the beak of another has a royal look; the
      featureless are faultless; the dark are manly, the fair angels; the sickly
      have a new term of endearment invented expressly for them, which is
      ‘honey-pale.’ <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage475A" class="pginternal">475</a></span>Lovers of wine and lovers of ambition also desire the
      objects of their affection in every form. Now here comes the point:—The
      philosopher too is a lover of knowledge in every form; he has an
      insatiable curiosity. ‘But will curiosity make a philosopher? Are the
      lovers of sights and sounds, who let out their ears to every chorus at the
      Dionysiac festivals, to be called philosophers?’ They are not true
      philosophers, but only an imitation. ‘Then how are we to describe the
      true?’
    </p>
<p>
      You would acknowledge the existence of abstract ideas, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage476A" class="pginternal">476</a></span>such as justice,
      beauty, good, evil, which are severally one, yet in their various
      combinations appear to be many. Those who recognize these realities are
      philosophers; whereas the other class hear sounds and see colours, and
      understand their use in the arts, but cannot attain to the true or waking
      vision of absolute justice or beauty or truth; they have not the light of
      knowledge, but of opinion, and what they see is a dream only. Perhaps he
      of whom we say the last will be angry with us; can we pacify him without
      revealing the disorder of his mind? Suppose we say that, if he has
      knowledge we rejoice to hear it, but knowledge must be of something which
      is, as ignorance is of something which is not; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage477A" class="pginternal">477</a></span>and there is a third thing,
      which both is and is not, and is matter of opinion only. Opinion and
      knowledge, then, having distinct objects, must also be distinct faculties.
      And <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxviii"></a>lxxviii</span> by faculties I mean powers unseen and distinguishable only by the
      difference in their objects, as opinion and knowledge differ, since the
      one is liable to err, but the other is unerring and is the mightiest of
      all our faculties. If being is the object of knowledge, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage478A" class="pginternal">478</a></span>and not-being of
      ignorance, and these are the extremes, opinion must lie between them, and
      may be called darker than the one and brighter than the other. This
      intermediate or contingent matter is and is not at the same time, and
      partakes both of existence and of non-existence. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage479A" class="pginternal">479</a></span>Now I would ask my good
      friend, who denies abstract beauty and justice, and affirms a many
      beautiful and a many just, whether everything he sees is not in some point
      of view different—the beautiful ugly, the pious impious, the just
      unjust? Is not the double also the half, and are not heavy and light
      relative terms which pass into one another? Everything is and is not, as
      in the old riddle—‘A man and not a man shot and did not shoot a bird
      and not a bird with a stone and not a stone.’ The mind cannot be fixed on
      either alternative; and these ambiguous, intermediate, erring,
      half-lighted objects, which have a disorderly movement in the region
      between being and not-being, are the proper matter of opinion, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage480A" class="pginternal">480</a></span>as the
      immutable objects are the proper matter of knowledge. And he who grovels
      in the world of sense, and has only this uncertain perception of things,
      is not a philosopher, but a lover of opinion only….
    </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic V.</i><br>I<span class="smcap">NTRODUCTION.</span></span>
      The fifth book is the new beginning of the Republic, in which the
      community of property and of family are first maintained, and the
      transition is made to the kingdom of philosophers. For both of these
      Plato, after his manner, has been preparing in some chance words of Book
      IV (<a href="#stpage424A" class="pginternal">424 A</a>), which fall unperceived on the reader’s mind, as they are supposed at
      first to have fallen on the ear of Glaucon and Adeimantus. The
      ‘paradoxes,’ as Morgenstern terms them, of this book of the Republic will
      be reserved for another place; a few remarks on the style, and some
      explanations of difficulties, may be briefly added.
    </p>
<p>
      First, there is the image of the waves, which serves for a sort of scheme
      or plan of the book. The first wave, the second wave, the third and
      greatest wave come rolling in, and we hear the roar of them. All that can
      be said of the extravagance of Plato’s proposals is anticipated by
      himself. Nothing is more admirable than the <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxix"></a>lxxix</span> hesitation with which he
      proposes the solemn text, ‘Until kings are philosophers,’ &amp;c.; or the
      reaction from the sublime to the ridiculous, when Glaucon describes the
      manner in which the new truth will be received by mankind.
    </p>
<p>
      Some defects and difficulties may be noted in the execution of the
      communistic plan. Nothing is told us of the application of communism to
      the lower classes; nor is the table of prohibited degrees capable of being
      made out. It is quite possible that a child born at one hymeneal festival
      may marry one of its own brothers or sisters, or even one of its parents,
      at another. Plato is afraid of incestuous unions, but at the same time he
      does not wish to bring before us the fact that the city would be divided
      into families of those born seven and nine months after each hymeneal
      festival. If it were worth while to argue seriously about such fancies, we
      might remark that while all the old affinities are abolished, the newly
      prohibited affinity rests not on any natural or rational principle, but
      only upon the accident of children having been born in the same month and
      year. Nor does he explain how the lots could be so manipulated by the
      legislature as to bring together the fairest and best. The singular
      expression (<a href="#stpage460E" class="pginternal">460 E</a>) which is employed to describe the age of five-and-twenty may
      perhaps be taken from some poet.
    </p>
<p>
      In the delineation of the philosopher, the illustrations of the nature of
      philosophy derived from love are more suited to the apprehension of
      Glaucon, the Athenian man of pleasure, than to modern tastes or feelings (cp. v. <a href="#stpage474A" class="pginternal">474</a>, <a href="#stpage475A" class="pginternal">475</a>).
      They are partly facetious, but also contain a germ of truth. That science
      is a whole, remains a true principle of inductive as well as of
      metaphysical philosophy; and the love of universal knowledge is still the
      characteristic of the philosopher in modern as well as in ancient times.
    </p>
<p>
      At the end of the fifth book Plato introduces the figment of contingent
      matter, which has exercised so great an influence both on the Ethics and
      Theology of the modern world, and which occurs here for the first time in
      the history of philosophy. He did not remark that the degrees of knowledge
      in the subject have nothing corresponding to them in the object. With him
      a word must answer to an idea; and he could not conceive of an opinion
      which was an opinion about nothing. The influence of analogy led him to
      invent ‘parallels and conjugates’ and to overlook facts. To us <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxx"></a>lxxx</span> some of his
      difficulties are puzzling only from their simplicity: we do not perceive
      that the answer to them ‘is tumbling out at our feet.’ To the mind of
      early thinkers, the conception of not-being was dark and mysterious (Sophist, 254 A); they
      did not see that this terrible apparition which threatened destruction to
      all knowledge was only a logical determination. The common term under
      which, through the accidental use of language, two entirely different
      ideas were included was another source of confusion. Thus through the
      ambiguity of <span class="transl" title="dokei=n, phai/netai, e)/oiken, k.t.l.">δοκεῖν, φαίνεται, ἔοικεν, κ.τ.λ.</span>, Plato, attempting to introduce order into the first
      chaos of human thought, seems to have confused perception and opinion, and
      to have failed to distinguish the contingent from the relative. In the
      Theaetetus the first of these difficulties begins to clear up; in the
      Sophist the second; and for this, as well as for other reasons, both these
      dialogues are probably to be regarded as later than the Republic.

<b>BOOK VI.</b> <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage484A" class="pginternal">484</a></span>Having determined that the many have no knowledge of true being,
      and have no clear patterns in their minds of justice, beauty, truth, and
      that philosophers have such patterns, we have now to ask whether they or
      the many shall be rulers in our State. But who can doubt that philosophers
      should be chosen, if they have the other qualities which are required in a
      ruler? <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage485A" class="pginternal">485</a></span>For they are lovers of the knowledge of the eternal and of all
      truth; they are haters of falsehood; their meaner desires are absorbed in
      the interests of knowledge; they are spectators of all time and all
      existence; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage486A" class="pginternal">486</a></span>and in the magnificence of their contemplation the life of man
      is as nothing to them, nor is death fearful. Also they are of a social,
      gracious disposition, equally free from cowardice and arrogance. They
      learn and remember easily; they have harmonious, well-regulated minds;
      truth flows to them sweetly by nature. Can the god of Jealousy himself
      <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage487A" class="pginternal">487</a></span>find any fault with such an assemblage of good qualities?
    </p>
<p>
      Here Adeimantus interposes:—‘No man can answer you, Socrates; but
      every man feels that this is owing to his own deficiency in argument. He
      is driven from one position to another, until he has nothing more to say,
      just as an unskilful player at draughts is reduced to his last move by a
      more skilled opponent. And yet all the time he may be right. <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxxi"></a>lxxxi</span> He may know,
      in this very instance, that those who make philosophy the business of
      their lives, generally turn out rogues if they are bad men, and fools if
      they are good. What do you say?’ I should say that he is quite right.
      ‘Then how is such an admission reconcileable with the doctrine that
      philosophers should be kings?’
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage488A" class="pginternal">488</a></span>I shall answer you in a parable which will also let you see how poor a
      hand I am at the invention of allegories. The relation of good men to
      their governments is so peculiar, that in order to defend them I must take
      an illustration from the world of fiction. Conceive the captain of a ship,
      taller by a head and shoulders than any of the crew, yet a little deaf, a
      little blind, and rather ignorant of the seaman’s art. The sailors want to
      steer, although they know nothing of the art; and they have a theory that
      it cannot be learned. If the helm is refused them, they drug the captain’s
      posset, bind him hand and foot, and take possession of the ship. He who
      joins in the mutiny is termed a good pilot and what not; they have no
      conception that the true pilot must observe the winds and the stars, and
      must be their master, whether they like it or not;—such an one would
      be called by them fool, prater, star-gazer. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage489A" class="pginternal">489</a></span>This is my parable; which I
      will beg you to interpret for me to those gentlemen who ask why the
      philosopher has such an evil name, and to explain to them that not he, but
      those who will not use him, are to blame for his uselessness. The
      philosopher should not beg of mankind to be put in authority over them.
      The wise man should not seek the rich, as the proverb bids, but every man,
      whether rich or poor, must knock at the door of the physician when he has
      need of him. Now the pilot is the philosopher—he whom in the parable
      they call star-gazer, and the mutinous sailors are the mob of politicians
      by whom he is rendered useless. Not that these are the worst enemies of
      philosophy, who is far more dishonoured by her own professing sons when
      they are corrupted by the world. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage490A" class="pginternal">490</a></span>Need I recall the original image of the
      philosopher? Did we not say of him just now, that he loved truth and hated
      falsehood, and that he could not rest in the multiplicity of phenomena,
      but was led by a sympathy in his own nature to the contemplation of the
      absolute? All the virtues as well as truth, who is the leader of them,
      took up their abode in his soul. But as you were observing, if we turn
      aside to view the reality, we see <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxxii"></a>lxxxii</span> that the persons who were thus
      described, with the exception of a small and useless class, are utter
      rogues.
    </p>
<p>
      The point which has to be considered, is the origin of this corruption in
      nature. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage491A" class="pginternal">491</a></span>Every one will admit that the philosopher, in our description of
      him, is a rare being. But what numberless causes tend to destroy these
      rare beings! There is no good thing which may not be a cause of evil—health,
      wealth, strength, rank, and the virtues themselves, when placed under
      unfavourable circumstances. For as in the animal or vegetable world the
      strongest seeds most need the accompaniment of good air and soil, so the
      best of human characters turn out the worst when they fall upon an
      unsuitable soil; whereas weak natures hardly ever do any considerable good
      or harm; they are not the stuff out of which either great criminals or
      great heroes are made. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage492A" class="pginternal">492</a></span>The philosopher follows the same analogy: he is
      either the best or the worst of all men. Some persons say that the
      Sophists are the corrupters of youth; but is not public opinion the real
      Sophist who is everywhere present—in those very persons, in the
      assembly, in the courts, in the camp, in the applauses and hisses of the
      theatre re-echoed by the surrounding hills? Will not a young man’s heart
      leap amid these discordant sounds? and will any education save him from
      being carried away by the torrent? Nor is this all. For if he will not
      yield to opinion, there follows the gentle compulsion of exile or death.
      What principle of rival Sophists or anybody else can overcome in such an
      unequal contest? Characters there may be more than human, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage493A" class="pginternal">493</a></span>who are
      exceptions—God may save a man, but not his own strength. Further, I
      would have you consider that the hireling Sophist only gives back to the
      world their own opinions; he is the keeper of the monster, who knows how
      to flatter or anger him, and observes the meaning of his inarticulate
      grunts. Good is what pleases him, evil what he dislikes; truth and beauty
      are determined only by the taste of the brute. Such is the Sophist’s
      wisdom, and such is the condition of those who make public opinion the
      test of truth, whether in art or in morals. The curse is laid upon them of
      being and doing what it approves, and when they attempt first principles
      the failure is ludicrous. Think of all this and ask yourself whether the
      world is more likely to be a believer in the unity of the idea, or in the
      multiplicity of phenomena. And the world if not a believer <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxxiii"></a>lxxxiii</span> in the idea
      cannot be a philosopher, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage494A" class="pginternal">494</a></span>and must therefore be a persecutor of
      philosophers. There is another evil:—the world does not like to lose
      the gifted nature, and so they flatter the young [Alcibiades] into a
      magnificent opinion of his own capacity; the tall, proper youth begins to
      expand, and is dreaming of kingdoms and empires. If at this instant a
      friend whispers to him, ‘Now the gods lighten thee; thou art a great fool’
      and must be educated—do you think that he will listen? Or suppose a
      better sort of man who is attracted towards philosophy, will they not make
      Herculean efforts to spoil and corrupt him? <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage495A" class="pginternal">495</a></span>Are we not right in saying
      that the love of knowledge, no less than riches, may divert him? Men of
      this class [Critias] often become politicians—they are the authors
      of great mischief in states, and sometimes also of great good. And thus
      philosophy is deserted by her natural protectors, and others enter in and
      dishonour her. Vulgar little minds see the land open and rush from the
      prisons of the arts into her temple. A clever mechanic having a soul
      coarse as his body, thinks that he will gain caste by becoming her suitor.
      For philosophy, even in her fallen estate, has a dignity of her own—and
      he, like a bald little blacksmith’s apprentice as he is, having made some
      money and got out of durance, washes and dresses himself as a bridegroom
      and marries his master’s daughter. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage496A" class="pginternal">496</a></span>What will be the issue of such
      marriages? Will they not be vile and bastard, devoid of truth and nature?
      ‘They will.’ Small, then, is the remnant of genuine philosophers; there
      may be a few who are citizens of small states, in which politics are not
      worth thinking of, or who have been detained by Theages’ bridle of ill
      health; for my own case of the oracular sign is almost unique, and too
      rare to be worth mentioning. And these few when they have tasted the
      pleasures of philosophy, and have taken a look at that den of thieves and
      place of wild beasts, which is human life, will stand aside from the storm
      under the shelter of a wall, and try to preserve their own innocence and
      to depart in peace. ‘A great work, too, will have been accomplished by
      them.’ Great, yes, but not the greatest; for man is a social being, and
      can only attain his highest development in the society which is best
      suited to him.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage497A" class="pginternal">497</a></span>Enough, then, of the causes why philosophy has such an evil name. Another
      question is, Which of existing states is suited to her? Not one of them;
      at present she is like some exotic seed <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxxiv"></a>lxxxiv</span> which degenerates in a strange
      soil; only in her proper state will she be shown to be of heavenly growth.
      ‘And is her proper state ours or some other?’ Ours in all points but one,
      which was left undetermined. You may remember our saying that some living
      mind or witness of the legislator was needed in states. But we were afraid
      to enter upon a subject of such difficulty, and now the question recurs
      and has not grown easier:—How may philosophy be safely studied? Let
      us bring her into the light of day, and make an end of the inquiry.
    </p>
<p>
      In the first place, I say boldly that nothing can be worse than the
      present mode of study. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage498A" class="pginternal">498</a></span>Persons usually pick up a little philosophy in
      early youth, and in the intervals of business, but they never master the
      real difficulty, which is dialectic. Later, perhaps, they occasionally go
      to a lecture on philosophy. Years advance, and the sun of philosophy,
      unlike that of Heracleitus, sets never to rise again. This order of
      education should be reversed; it should begin with gymnastics in youth,
      and as the man strengthens, he should increase the gymnastics of his soul.
      Then, when active life is over, let him finally return to philosophy. ‘You
      are in earnest, Socrates, but the world will be equally earnest in
      withstanding you—no more than Thrasymachus.’ Do not make a quarrel
      between Thrasymachus and me, who were never enemies and are now good
      friends enough. And I shall do my best to convince him and all mankind of
      the truth of my words, or at any rate to prepare for the future when, in
      another life, we may again take part in similar discussions. ‘That will be
      a long time hence.’ Not long in comparison with eternity. The many will
      probably remain incredulous, for they have never seen the natural unity of
      ideas, but only artificial juxtapositions; not free and generous thoughts,
      but tricks of controversy and quips of law;—<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage499A" class="pginternal">499</a></span>a perfect man ruling in
      a perfect state, even a single one they have not known. And we foresaw
      that there was no chance of perfection either in states or individuals
      until a necessity was laid upon philosophers—not the rogues, but
      those whom we called the useless class—of holding office; or until
      the sons of kings were inspired with a true love of philosophy. Whether in
      the infinity of past time there has been, or is in some distant land, or
      ever will be hereafter, an ideal such as we have described, we stoutly
      maintain that there has been, is, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxxv"></a>lxxxv</span> will be such a state whenever the
      Muse of philosophy rules. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage500A" class="pginternal">500</a></span>Will you say that the world is of another mind?
      O, my friend, do not revile the world! They will soon change their opinion
      if they are gently entreated, and are taught the true nature of the
      philosopher. Who can hate a man who loves him? Or be jealous of one who
      has no jealousy? Consider, again, that the many hate not the true but the
      false philosophers—the pretenders who force their way in without
      invitation, and are always speaking of persons and not of principles,
      which is unlike the spirit of philosophy. For the true philosopher
      despises earthly strife; his eye is fixed on the eternal order in
      accordance with which he moulds himself into the Divine image (and not
      himself only, but other men), and is the creator of the virtues private as
      well as public. When mankind see that the happiness of states is only to
      be found in that image, will they be angry with us for attempting to
      delineate it? ‘Certainly not. But what will be the process of
      delineation?’ <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage501A" class="pginternal">501</a></span>The artist will do nothing until he has made a <i>tabula rasa</i>;
      on this he will inscribe the constitution of a state, glancing often at
      the divine truth of nature, and from that deriving the godlike among men,
      mingling the two elements, rubbing out and painting in, until there is a
      perfect harmony or fusion of the divine and human. But perhaps the world
      will doubt the existence of such an artist. What will they doubt? That the
      philosopher is a lover of truth, having a nature akin to the best?—and
      if they admit this will they still quarrel with us for making philosophers
      our kings? ‘They will be less disposed to quarrel.’ <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage502A" class="pginternal">502</a></span>Let us assume then
      that they are pacified. Still, a person may hesitate about the probability
      of the son of a king being a philosopher. And we do not deny that they are
      very liable to be corrupted; but yet surely in the course of ages there
      might be one exception—and one is enough. If one son of a king were
      a philosopher, and had obedient citizens, he might bring the ideal polity
      into being. Hence we conclude that our laws are not only the best, but
      that they are also possible, though not free from difficulty.
    </p>
<p>
      I gained nothing by evading the troublesome questions which arose
      concerning women and children. I will be wiser now and acknowledge that we
      must go to the bottom of another question: What is to be the education of
      our guardians? It was <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxxvi"></a>lxxxvi</span> agreed that they were to be lovers of their country,
      <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage503A" class="pginternal">503</a></span>and were to be tested in the refiner’s fire of pleasures and pains, and
      those who came forth pure and remained fixed in their principles were to
      have honours and rewards in life and after death. But at this point, the
      argument put on her veil and turned into another path. I hesitated to make
      the assertion which I now hazard,—that our guardians must be
      philosophers. You remember all the contradictory elements, which met in
      the philosopher—how difficult to find them all in a single person!
      Intelligence and spirit are not often combined with steadiness; the
      stolid, fearless, nature is averse to intellectual toil. And yet these
      opposite elements are all necessary, and therefore, as we were saying
      before, the aspirant must be tested in pleasures and dangers; and also, as
      we must now further add, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage504A" class="pginternal">504</a></span>in the highest branches of knowledge. You will
      remember, that when we spoke of the virtues mention was made of a longer
      road, which you were satisfied to leave unexplored. ‘Enough seemed to have
      been said.’ Enough, my friend; but what is enough while anything remains
      wanting? Of all men the guardian must not faint in the search after truth;
      he must be prepared to take the longer road, or he will never reach that
      higher region which is above the four virtues; and of the virtues too he
      must not only get an outline, but a clear and distinct vision. (Strange
      that we should be so precise about trifles, so careless about the highest
      truths!) ‘And what are the highest?’ <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage505A" class="pginternal">505</a></span>You to pretend unconsciousness, when
      you have so often heard me speak of the idea of good, about which we know
      so little, and without which though a man gain the world he has no profit
      of it! Some people imagine that the good is wisdom; but this involves a
      circle,—the good, they say, is wisdom, wisdom has to do with the
      good. According to others the good is pleasure; but then comes the
      absurdity that good is bad, for there are bad pleasures as well as good.
      Again, the good must have reality; a man may desire the appearance of
      virtue, but he will not desire the appearance of good. Ought our guardians
      then to be ignorant of this supreme principle, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage506A" class="pginternal">506</a></span>of which every man has a
      presentiment, and without which no man has any real knowledge of anything?
      ‘But, Socrates, what is this supreme principle, knowledge or pleasure, or
      what? You may think me troublesome, but I say that you have no business to
      be always <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxxvii"></a>lxxxvii</span> repeating the doctrines of others instead of giving us your
      own.’ Can I say what I do not know? ‘You may offer an opinion.’ And will
      the blindness and crookedness of opinion content you when you might have
      the light and certainty of science? ‘I will only ask you to give such an
      explanation of the good as you have given already of temperance and
      justice.’ I wish that I could, but in my present mood I cannot reach to
      the height of the knowledge of the good. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage507A" class="pginternal">507</a></span>To the parent or principal I
      cannot introduce you, but to the child begotten in his image, which I may
      compare with the interest on the principal, I will. (Audit the account,
      and do not let me give you a false statement of the debt.) You remember
      our old distinction of the many beautiful and the one beautiful, the
      particular and the universal, the objects of sight and the objects of
      thought? Did you ever consider that the objects of sight imply a faculty
      of sight which is the most complex and costly of our senses, requiring not
      only objects of sense, but also a medium, which is light; without which
      the sight will not distinguish between colours and all will be a blank?
      <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage508A" class="pginternal">508</a></span>For light is the noble bond between the perceiving faculty and the thing
      perceived, and the god who gives us light is the sun, who is the eye of
      the day, but is not to be confounded with the eye of man. This eye of the
      day or sun is what I call the child of the good, standing in the same
      relation to the visible world as the good to the intellectual. When the
      sun shines the eye sees, and in the intellectual world where truth is,
      there is sight and light. Now that which is the sun of intelligent
      natures, is the idea of good, the cause of knowledge and truth, yet other
      and fairer than they are, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage509A" class="pginternal">509</a></span>and standing in the same relation to them in
      which the sun stands to light. O inconceivable height of beauty, which is
      above knowledge and above truth! (‘You cannot surely mean pleasure,’ he
      said. Peace, I replied.) And this idea of good, like the sun, is also the
      cause of growth, and the author not of knowledge only, but of being, yet
      greater far than either in dignity and power. ‘That is a reach of thought
      more than human; but, pray, go on with the image, for I suspect that there
      is more behind.’ There is, I said; and bearing in mind our two suns or
      principles, imagine further their corresponding worlds—one of the
      visible, the other of the intelligible; you may assist your fancy by
      figuring the distinction under the image <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxxviii"></a>lxxxviii</span> of a line divided into two
      unequal parts, and may again subdivide each part into two lesser segments
      representative of the stages of knowledge in either sphere. The lower
      portion of the lower or visible sphere will consist of shadows and
      reflections, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage510A" class="pginternal">510</a></span>and its upper and smaller portion will contain real objects
      in the world of nature or of art. The sphere of the intelligible will also
      have two divisions,—one of mathematics, in which there is no ascent
      but all is descent; no inquiring into premises, but only drawing of
      inferences. In this division the mind works with figures and numbers, the
      images of which are taken not from the shadows, but from the objects,
      although the truth of them is seen only with the mind’s eye; and they are
      used as hypotheses without being analysed. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage511A" class="pginternal">511</a></span>Whereas in the other division
      reason uses the hypotheses as stages or steps in the ascent to the idea of
      good, to which she fastens them, and then again descends, walking firmly
      in the region of ideas, and of ideas only, in her ascent as well as
      descent, and finally resting in them. ‘I partly understand,’ he replied;
      ‘you mean that the ideas of science are superior to the hypothetical,
      metaphorical conceptions of geometry and the other arts or sciences,
      whichever is to be the name of them; and the latter conceptions you refuse
      to make subjects of pure intellect, because they have no first principle,
      although when resting on a first principle, they pass into the higher
      sphere.’ You understand me very well, I said. And now to those four
      divisions of knowledge you may assign four corresponding faculties—pure
      intelligence to the highest sphere; active intelligence to the second; to
      the third, faith; to the fourth, the perception of shadows—and the
      clearness of the several faculties will be in the same ratio as the truth
      of the objects to which they are related….

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic VI.</i><br>I<span class="smcap">NTRODUCTION.</span></span>
      Like Socrates, we may recapitulate the virtues of the philosopher. In
      language which seems to reach beyond the horizon of that age and country,
      he is described as ‘the spectator of all time and all existence.’ He has
      the noblest gifts of nature, and makes the highest use of them. All his
      desires are absorbed in the love of wisdom, which is the love of truth.
      None of the graces of a beautiful soul are wanting in him; neither can he
      fear death, or think much of human life. The ideal of modern <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagelxxxix"></a>lxxxix</span> times hardly
      retains the simplicity of the antique; there is not the same originality
      either in truth or error which characterized the Greeks. The philosopher
      is no longer living in the unseen, nor is he sent by an oracle to convince
      mankind of ignorance; nor does he regard knowledge as a system of ideas
      leading upwards by regular stages to the idea of good. The eagerness of
      the pursuit has abated; there is more division of labour and less of
      comprehensive reflection upon nature and human life as a whole; more of
      exact observation and less of anticipation and inspiration. Still, in the
      altered conditions of knowledge, the parallel is not wholly lost; and
      there may be a use in translating the conception of Plato into the
      language of our own age. The philosopher in modern times is one who fixes
      his mind on the laws of nature in their sequence and connexion, not on
      fragments or pictures of nature; on history, not on controversy; on the
      truths which are acknowledged by the few, not on the opinions of the many.
      He is aware of the importance of ‘classifying according to nature,’ and
      will try to ‘separate the limbs of science without breaking them’
      (Phaedr. 265 E). There is no part of truth, whether great or small, which he
      will dishonour; and in the least things he will discern the greatest
      (Parmen. 130 C). Like the ancient philosopher he sees the world pervaded by
      analogies, but he can also tell ‘why in some cases a single instance is
      sufficient for an induction’ (Mill’s Logic, 3, 3, 3), while in other cases a
      thousand examples would prove nothing. He inquires into a portion of
      knowledge only, because the whole has grown too vast to be embraced by a
      single mind or life. He has a clearer conception of the divisions of
      science and of their relation to the mind of man than was possible to the
      ancients. Like Plato, he has a vision of the unity of knowledge, not as
      the beginning of philosophy to be attained by a study of elementary
      mathematics, but as the far-off result of the working of many minds in
      many ages. He is aware that mathematical studies are preliminary to almost
      every other; at the same time, he will not reduce all varieties of
      knowledge to the type of mathematics. He too must have a nobility of
      character, without which genius loses the better half of greatness.
      Regarding the world as a point in immensity, and each individual as a link
      in a never-ending chain of existence, he will not think much of his own
      life, or be greatly afraid of death.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexc"></a>xc</span> Adeimantus objects first of all to the form of the Socratic reasoning,
      thus showing that Plato is aware of the imperfection of his own method. He
      brings the accusation against himself which might be brought against him
      by a modern logician—that he extracts the answer because he knows
      how to put the question. In a long argument words are apt to change their
      meaning slightly, or premises may be assumed or conclusions inferred with
      rather too much certainty or universality; the variation at each step may
      be unobserved, and yet at last the divergence becomes considerable. Hence
      the failure of attempts to apply arithmetical or algebraic formulae to
      logic. The imperfection, or rather the higher and more elastic nature of
      language, does not allow words to have the precision of numbers or of
      symbols. And this quality in language impairs the force of an argument
      which has many steps.
    </p>
<p>
      The objection, though fairly met by Socrates in this particular instance,
      may be regarded as implying a reflection upon the Socratic mode of
      reasoning. And here, as at p. <a href="#stpage506B" class="pginternal">506 B</a>, Plato seems to intimate that the time
      had come when the negative and interrogative method of Socrates must be
      superseded by a positive and constructive one, of which examples are given
      in some of the later dialogues. Adeimantus further argues that the ideal
      is wholly at variance with facts; for experience proves philosophers to be
      either useless or rogues. Contrary to all expectation (cp. p. <a href="#stpage497A" class="pginternal">497</a> for a similar surprise) Socrates has no
      hesitation in admitting the truth of this, and explains the anomaly in an
      allegory, first characteristically depreciating his own inventive powers.
      In this allegory the people are distinguished from the professional
      politicians, and, as elsewhere, are spoken of in a tone of pity rather
      than of censure under the image of ‘the noble captain who is not very
      quick in his perceptions.’
    </p>
<p>
      The uselessness of philosophers is explained by the circumstance that
      mankind will not use them. The world in all ages has been divided between
      contempt and fear of those who employ the power of ideas and know no other
      weapons. Concerning the false philosopher, Socrates argues that the best
      is most liable to corruption; and that the finer nature is more likely to
      suffer from alien conditions. We too observe that there are some kinds <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexci"></a>xci</span> of
      excellence which spring from a peculiar delicacy of constitution; as is
      evidently true of the poetical and imaginative temperament, which often
      seems to depend on impressions, and hence can only breathe or live in a
      certain atmosphere. The man of genius has greater pains and greater
      pleasures, greater powers and greater weaknesses, and often a greater play
      of character than is to be found in ordinary men. He can assume the
      disguise of virtue or disinterestedness without having them, or veil
      personal enmity in the language of patriotism and philosophy,—he can
      say the word which all men are thinking, he has an insight which is
      terrible into the follies and weaknesses of his fellow-men. An Alcibiades,
      a Mirabeau, or a Napoleon the First, are born either to be the authors of
      great evils in states, or ‘of great good, when they are drawn in that
      direction.’
    </p>
<p>
      Yet the thesis, ‘corruptio optimi pessima,’ cannot be maintained generally
      or without regard to the kind of excellence which is corrupted. The alien
      conditions which are corrupting to one nature, may be the elements of
      culture to another. In general a man can only receive his highest
      development in a congenial state or family, among friends or
      fellow-workers. But also he may sometimes be stirred by adverse
      circumstances to such a degree that he rises up against them and reforms
      them. And while weaker or coarser characters will extract good out of
      evil, say in a corrupt state of the church or of society, and live on
      happily, allowing the evil to remain, the finer or stronger natures may be
      crushed or spoiled by surrounding influences—may become misanthrope
      and philanthrope by turns; or in a few instances, like the founders of the
      monastic orders, or the Reformers, owing to some peculiarity in themselves
      or in their age, may break away entirely from the world and from the
      church, sometimes into great good, sometimes into great evil, sometimes
      into both. And the same holds in the lesser sphere of a convent, a school,
      a family.
    </p>
<p>
      Plato would have us consider how easily the best natures are overpowered
      by public opinion, and what efforts the rest of mankind will make to get
      possession of them. The world, the church, their own profession, any
      political or party organization, are always carrying them off their legs
      and teaching them to apply high and holy names to their own prejudices and
      interests. <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexcii"></a>xcii</span> The ‘monster’ corporation to which they belong judges right and
      truth to be the pleasure of the community. The individual becomes one with
      his order; or, if he resists, the world is too much for him, and will
      sooner or later be revenged on him. This is, perhaps, a one-sided but not
      wholly untrue picture of the maxims and practice of mankind when they ‘sit
      down together at an assembly,’ either in ancient or modern times.
    </p>
<p>
      When the higher natures are corrupted by politics, the lower take
      possession of the vacant place of philosophy. This is described in one of
      those continuous images in which the argument, to use a Platonic
      expression, ‘veils herself,’ and which is dropped and reappears at
      intervals. The question is asked,—Why are the citizens of states so
      hostile to philosophy? The answer is, that they do not know her. And yet
      there is also a better mind of the many; they would believe if they were
      taught. But hitherto they have only known a conventional imitation of
      philosophy, words without thoughts, systems which have no life in them; a
      [divine] person uttering the words of beauty and freedom, the friend of
      man holding communion with the Eternal, and seeking to frame the state in
      that image, they have never known. The same double feeling respecting the
      mass of mankind has always existed among men. The first thought is that
      the people are the enemies of truth and right; the second, that this only
      arises out of an accidental error and confusion, and that they do not
      really hate those who love them, if they could be educated to know them.
    </p>
<p>
      In the latter part of the sixth book, three questions have to be
      considered: 1st, the nature of the longer and more circuitous way, which
      is contrasted with the shorter and more imperfect method of Book IV; 2nd,
      the heavenly pattern or idea of the state; 3rd, the relation of the
      divisions of knowledge to one another and to the corresponding faculties
      of the soul.
    </p>
<p>
      1. Of the higher method of knowledge in Plato we have only a glimpse.
      Neither here nor in the Phaedrus or Symposium, nor yet in the Philebus or
      Sophist, does he give any clear explanation of his meaning. He would
      probably have described his method as proceeding by regular steps to a
      system of universal knowledge, which inferred the parts from the whole
      rather than the whole from the parts. This ideal logic is not practised by
      him <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexciii"></a>xciii</span> in the search after justice, or in the analysis of the parts of the
      soul; there, like Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics, he argues from
      experience and the common use of language. But at the end of the sixth
      book he conceives another and more perfect method, in which all ideas are
      only steps or grades or moments of thought, forming a connected whole
      which is self-supporting, and in which consistency is the test of truth.
      He does not explain to us in detail the nature of the process. Like many
      other thinkers both in ancient and modern times his mind seems to be
      filled with a vacant form which he is unable to realize. He supposes the
      sciences to have a natural order and connexion in an age when they can
      hardly be said to exist. He is hastening on to the ‘end of the
      intellectual world’ without even making a beginning of them.
    </p>
<p>
      In modern times we hardly need to be reminded that the process of
      acquiring knowledge is here confused with the contemplation of absolute
      knowledge. In all science <i>a priori</i> and <i>a posteriori</i> truths mingle in
      various proportions. The <i>a priori</i> part is that which is derived from the
      most universal experience of men, or is universally accepted by them; the
     <i>a posteriori</i> is that which grows up around the more general principles and
      becomes imperceptibly one with them. But Plato erroneously imagines that
      the synthesis is separable from the analysis, and that the method of
      science can anticipate science. In entertaining such a vision of <i>a priori</i>
      knowledge he is sufficiently justified, or at least his meaning may be
      sufficiently explained by the similar attempts of Descartes, Kant, Hegel,
      and even of Bacon himself, in modern philosophy. Anticipations or
      divinations, or prophetic glimpses of truths whether concerning man or
      nature, seem to stand in the same relation to ancient philosophy which
      hypotheses bear to modern inductive science. These ‘guesses at truth’ were
      not made at random; they arose from a superficial impression of
      uniformities and first principles in nature which the genius of the Greek,
      contemplating the expanse of heaven and earth, seemed to recognize in the
      distance. Nor can we deny that in ancient times knowledge must have stood
      still, and the human mind been deprived of the very instruments of
      thought, if philosophy had been strictly confined to the results of
      experience.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexciv"></a>xciv</span> 2. Plato supposes that when the tablet has been made blank the artist will
      fill in the lineaments of the ideal state. Is this a pattern laid up in
      heaven, or mere vacancy on which he is supposed to gaze with wondering
      eye? The answer is, that such ideals are framed partly by the omission of
      particulars, partly by imagination perfecting the form which experience
      supplies (Phaedo, 74). Plato represents these ideals in a figure as belonging
      to another world; and in modern times the idea will sometimes seem to
      precede, at other times to co-operate with the hand of the artist. As in
      science, so also in creative art, there is a synthetical as well as an
      analytical method. One man will have the whole in his mind before he
      begins; to another the processes of mind and hand will be simultaneous.
    </p>
<p>
      3. There is no difficulty in seeing that Plato’s divisions of knowledge
      are based, first, on the fundamental antithesis of sensible and
      intellectual which pervades the whole pre-Socratic philosophy; in which is
      implied also the opposition of the permanent and transient, of the
      universal and particular. But the age of philosophy in which he lived
      seemed to require a further distinction;—numbers and figures were
      beginning to separate from ideas. The world could no longer regard justice
      as a cube, and was learning to see, though imperfectly, that the
      abstractions of sense were distinct from the abstractions of mind. Between
      the Eleatic being or essence and the shadows of phenomena, the Pythagorean
      principle of number found a place, and was, as Aristotle remarks, a
      conducting medium from one to the other. Hence Plato is led to introduce a
      third term which had not hitherto entered into the scheme of his
      philosophy. He had observed the use of mathematics in education; they were
      the best preparation for higher studies. The subjective relation between
      them further suggested an objective one; although the passage from one to
      the other is really imaginary (Metaph. 1, 6, 4). For metaphysical and moral
      philosophy has no connexion with mathematics; number and figure are the
      abstractions of time and space, not the expressions of purely intellectual
      conceptions. When divested of metaphor, a straight line or a square has no
      more to do with right and justice than a crooked line with vice. The
      figurative association was mistaken for a real one; and thus the three
      latter divisions of the Platonic proportion were constructed.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexcv"></a>xcv</span> There is more difficulty in comprehending how he arrived at the first term
      of the series, which is nowhere else mentioned, and has no reference to
      any other part of his system. Nor indeed does the relation of shadows to
      objects correspond to the relation of numbers to ideas. Probably Plato has
      been led by the love of analogy (Timaeus, p. 32 B) to make four terms instead of
      three, although the objects perceived in both divisions of the lower
      sphere are equally objects of sense. He is also preparing the way, as his
      manner is, for the shadows of images at the beginning of the seventh book,
      and the imitation of an imitation in the tenth. The line may be regarded
      as reaching from unity to infinity, and is divided into two unequal parts,
      and subdivided into two more; each lower sphere is the multiplication of
      the preceding. Of the four faculties, faith in the lower division has an
      intermediate position (cp. for the use of the word faith or belief,
      <span class="transl" title="pi/stis">πίστις</span>, Timaeus, 29 C, 37 B), contrasting equally with the vagueness of the
      perception of shadows (<span class="transl" title="ei)kasi/a">εἰκασία</span>) and the higher certainty of understanding
      (<span class="transl" title="dia/noia">διάνοια</span>) and reason (<span class="transl" title="nou=s">νοῦς</span>).
    </p>
<p>
      The difference between understanding and mind or reason (<span class="transl" title="nou=s">νοῦς</span>) is
      analogous to the difference between acquiring knowledge in the parts and
      the contemplation of the whole. True knowledge is a whole, and is at rest;
      consistency and universality are the tests of truth. To this
      self-evidencing knowledge of the whole the faculty of mind is supposed to
      correspond. But there is a knowledge of the understanding which is
      incomplete and in motion always, because unable to rest in the subordinate
      ideas. Those ideas are called both images and hypotheses—images
      because they are clothed in sense, hypotheses because they are assumptions
      only, until they are brought into connexion with the idea of good.
    </p>
<p>
      The general meaning of the passage <a href="#stpage508A" class="pginternal">508</a>–511, so far
      as the thought contained in it admits of being translated into the terms
      of modern philosophy, may be described or explained as follows:—There
      is a truth, one and self-existent, to which by the help of a ladder let
      down from above, the human intelligence may ascend. This unity is like the
      sun in the heavens, the light by which all things are seen, the being by
      which they are created and sustained. It is the <em>idea</em> of good. And the
      steps of the ladder leading up to this highest or universal existence are
      the mathematical <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexcvi"></a>xcvi</span> sciences, which also contain in themselves an element of
      the universal. These, too, we see in a new manner when we connect them
      with the idea of good. They then cease to be hypotheses or pictures, and
      become essential parts of a higher truth which is at once their first
      principle and their final cause.
    </p>
<p>
      We cannot give any more precise meaning to this remarkable passage, but we
      may trace in it several rudiments or vestiges of thought which are common
      to us and to Plato: such as (1) the unity and correlation of the sciences,
      or rather of science, for in Plato’s time they were not yet parted off or
      distinguished; (2) the existence of a Divine Power, or life or idea or
      cause or reason, not yet conceived or no longer conceived as in the
      Timaeus and elsewhere under the form of a person; (3) the recognition of
      the hypothetical and conditional character of the mathematical sciences,
      and in a measure of every science when isolated from the rest; (4) the
      conviction of a truth which is invisible, and of a law, though hardly a
      law of nature, which permeates the intellectual rather than the visible
      world.
    </p>
<p>
      The method of Socrates is hesitating and tentative, awaiting the fuller
      explanation of the idea of good, and of the nature of dialectic in the
      seventh book. The imperfect intelligence of Glaucon, and the reluctance of
      Socrates to make a beginning, mark the difficulty of the subject. The
      allusion to Theages’ bridle, and to the internal oracle, or demonic sign,
      of Socrates, which here, as always in Plato, is only prohibitory; the
      remark that the salvation of any remnant of good in the present evil state
      of the world is due to God only; the reference to a future state of
      existence, <a href="#stpage498D" class="pginternal">498 D</a>, which is unknown to Glaucon in the tenth book, <a href="#stpage608D" class="pginternal">608 D</a>, and in which the
      discussions of Socrates and his disciples would be resumed; the surprise in the answers at <a href="#stpage487E" class="pginternal">487 E</a> and <a href="#stpage497B" class="pginternal">497 B</a>; the fanciful irony of Socrates, where he pretends that he
      can only describe the strange position of the philosopher in a figure of
      speech; the original observation that the Sophists, after all, are only
      the representatives and not the leaders of public opinion; the picture of
      the philosopher standing aside in the shower of sleet under a wall; the
      figure of ‘the great beast’ followed by the expression of good-will
      towards the common people who would not have rejected the philosopher if
      they had known him; the ‘right noble thought’ that the highest <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexcvii"></a>xcvii</span> truths
      demand the greatest exactness; the hesitation of Socrates in returning
      once more to his well-worn theme of the idea of good; the ludicrous
      earnestness of Glaucon; the comparison of philosophy to a deserted maiden
      who marries beneath her—are some of the most interesting
      characteristics of the sixth book.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet a few more words may be added, on the old theme, which was so oft
      discussed in the Socratic circle, of which we, like Glaucon and
      Adeimantus, would fain, if possible, have a clearer notion. Like them, we
      are dissatisfied when we are told that the idea of good can only be
      revealed to a student of the mathematical sciences, and we are inclined to
      think that neither we nor they could have been led along that path to any
      satisfactory goal. For we have learned that differences of quantity cannot
      pass into differences of quality, and that the mathematical sciences can
      never rise above themselves into the sphere of our higher thoughts,
      although they may sometimes furnish symbols and expressions of them, and
      may train the mind in habits of abstraction and self-concentration. The
      illusion which was natural to an ancient philosopher has ceased to be an
      illusion to us. But if the process by which we are supposed to arrive at
      the idea of good be really imaginary, may not the idea itself be also a
      mere abstraction? We remark, first, that in all ages, and especially in
      primitive philosophy, words such as being, essence, unity, good, have
      exerted an extraordinary influence over the minds of men. The meagreness
      or negativeness of their content has been in an inverse ratio to their
      power. They have become the forms under which all things were
      comprehended. There was a need or instinct in the human soul which they
      satisfied; they were not ideas, but gods, and to this new mythology the
      men of a later generation began to attach the powers and associations of
      the elder deities.
    </p>
<p>
      The idea of good is one of those sacred words or forms of thought, which
      were beginning to take the place of the old mythology. It meant unity, in
      which all time and all existence were gathered up. It was the truth of all
      things, and also the light in which they shone forth, and became evident
      to intelligences human and divine. It was the cause of all things, the
      power by which they were brought into being. It was the universal reason
      divested of a human personality. It was the life as well as the <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexcviii"></a>xcviii</span> light of
      the world, all knowledge and all power were comprehended in it. The way to
      it was through the mathematical sciences, and these too were dependent on
      it. To ask whether God was the maker of it, or made by it, would be like
      asking whether God could be conceived apart from goodness, or goodness
      apart from God. The God of the Timaeus is not really at variance with the
      idea of good; they are aspects of the same, differing only as the personal
      from the impersonal, or the masculine from the neuter, the one being the
      expression or language of mythology, the other of philosophy.
    </p>
<p>
      This, or something like this, is the meaning of the idea of good as
      conceived by Plato. Ideas of number, order, harmony, development may also
      be said to enter into it. The paraphrase which has just been given of it
      goes beyond the actual words of Plato. We have perhaps arrived at the
      stage of philosophy which enables us to understand what he is aiming at,
      better than he did himself. We are beginning to realize what he saw darkly
      and at a distance. But if he could have been told that this, or some
      conception of the same kind, but higher than this, was the truth at which
      he was aiming, and the need which he sought to supply, he would gladly
      have recognized that more was contained in his own thoughts than he
      himself knew. As his words are few and his manner reticent and tentative,
      so must the style of his interpreter be. We should not approach his
      meaning more nearly by attempting to define it further. In translating him
      into the language of modern thought, we might insensibly lose the spirit
      of ancient philosophy. It is remarkable that although Plato speaks of the
      idea of good as the first principle of truth and being, it is nowhere
      mentioned in his writings except in this passage. Nor did it retain any
      hold upon the minds of his disciples in a later generation; it was
      probably unintelligible to them. Nor does the mention of it in Aristotle
      appear to have any reference to this or any other passage in his extant
      writings.

<p id="iaVII"><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic VII.</i><br>A<span class="smcap">NALYSIS.</span></span>
<b>BOOK VII.</b> <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage514A" class="pginternal">514</a></span>And now I will describe in a figure the enlightenment or
      unenlightenment of our nature:—Imagine human beings living in an
      underground den which is open towards the light; they have been there from
      childhood, having their necks and legs chained, and can only see into the
      den. <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexcix"></a>xcix</span> At a distance there is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners
      a raised way, and a low wall is built along the way, like the screen over
      which marionette players show their puppets. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage515A" class="pginternal">515</a></span>Behind the wall appear moving
      figures, who hold in their hands various works of art, and among them
      images of men and animals, wood and stone, and some of the passers-by are
      talking and others silent. ‘A strange parable,’ he said, ‘and strange
      captives.’ They are ourselves, I replied; and they see only the shadows of
      the images which the fire throws on the wall of the den; to these they
      give names, and if we add an echo which returns from the wall, the voices
      of the passengers will seem to proceed from the shadows. Suppose now that
      you suddenly turn them round and make them look with pain and grief to
      themselves at the real images; will they believe them to be real? Will not
      their eyes be dazzled, and will they not try to get away from the light to
      something which they are able to behold without blinking? <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage516A" class="pginternal">516</a></span>And suppose
      further, that they are dragged up a steep and rugged ascent into the
      presence of the sun himself, will not their sight be darkened with the
      excess of light? Some time will pass before they get the habit of
      perceiving at all; and at first they will be able to perceive only shadows
      and reflections in the water; then they will recognize the moon and the
      stars, and will at length behold the sun in his own proper place as he is.
      Last of all they will conclude:—This is he who gives us the year and
      the seasons, and is the author of all that we see. How will they rejoice
      in passing from darkness to light! How worthless to them will seem the
      honours and glories of the den! But now imagine further, that they descend
      into their old habitations;—in that underground dwelling they will
      not see as well as their fellows, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage517A" class="pginternal">517</a></span>and will not be able to compete with
      them in the measurement of the shadows on the wall; there will be many
      jokes about the man who went on a visit to the sun and lost his eyes, and
      if they find anybody trying to set free and enlighten one of their number,
      they will put him to death, if they can catch him. Now the cave or den is
      the world of sight, the fire is the sun, the way upwards is the way to
      knowledge, and in the world of knowledge the idea of good is last seen and
      with difficulty, but when seen is inferred to be the author of good and
      right—parent of the lord of light in this world, and of truth and
      understanding in the other. <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagec"></a>c</span> He who attains to the beatific vision is
      always going upwards; he is unwilling to descend into political assemblies
      and courts of law; for his eyes are apt to blink at the images or shadows
      of images which they behold in them—he cannot enter into the ideas
      of those who have never in their lives understood the relation of the
      shadow to the substance. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage518A" class="pginternal">518</a></span>But blindness is of two kinds, and may be caused
      either by passing out of darkness into light or out of light into
      darkness, and a man of sense will distinguish between them, and will not
      laugh equally at both of them, but the blindness which arises from fulness
      of light he will deem blessed, and pity the other; or if he laugh at the
      puzzled soul looking at the sun, he will have more reason to laugh than
      the inhabitants of the den at those who descend from above. There is a
      further lesson taught by this parable of ours. Some persons fancy that
      instruction is like giving eyes to the blind, but we say that the faculty
      of sight was always there, and that the soul only requires to be turned
      round towards the light. And this is conversion; other virtues are almost
      like bodily habits, and may be acquired in the same manner, but
      intelligence has a diviner life, and is indestructible, turning either to
      good or evil according to the direction given. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage519A" class="pginternal">519</a></span>Did you never observe how
      the mind of a clever rogue peers out of his eyes, and the more clearly he
      sees, the more evil he does? Now if you take such an one, and cut away
      from him those leaden weights of pleasure and desire which bind his soul
      to earth, his intelligence will be turned round, and he will behold the
      truth as clearly as he now discerns his meaner ends. And have we not
      decided that our rulers must neither be so uneducated as to have no fixed
      rule of life, nor so over-educated as to be unwilling to leave their
      paradise for the business of the world? We must choose out therefore the
      natures who are most likely to ascend to the light and knowledge of the
      good; but we must not allow them to remain in the region of light; they
      must be forced down again among the captives in the den to partake of
      their labours and honours. ‘Will they not think this a hardship?’ You
      should remember that our purpose in framing the State was not that our
      citizens should do what they like, but that they should serve the State
      for the common good of all. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage520A" class="pginternal">520</a></span>May we not fairly say to our philosopher,—Friend,
      we do you no wrong; for in other <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageci"></a>ci</span> States philosophy grows wild, and a wild
      plant owes nothing to the gardener, but you have been trained by us to be
      the rulers and kings of our hive, and therefore we must insist on your
      descending into the den. You must, each of you, take your turn, and become
      able to use your eyes in the dark, and with a little practice you will see
      far better than those who quarrel about the shadows, whose knowledge is a
      dream only, whilst yours is a waking reality. It may be that the saint or
      philosopher who is best fitted, may also be the least inclined to rule,
      but necessity is laid upon him, and he must no longer live in the heaven
      of ideas. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage521A" class="pginternal">521</a></span>And this will be the salvation of the State. For those who rule
      must not be those who are desirous to rule; and, if you can offer to our
      citizens a better life than that of rulers generally is, there will be a
      chance that the rich, not only in this world’s goods, but in virtue and
      wisdom, may bear rule. And the only life which is better than the life of
      political ambition is that of philosophy, which is also the best
      preparation for the government of a State.
    </p>
<p>
      Then now comes the question,—How shall we create our rulers; what
      way is there from darkness to light? The change is effected by philosophy;
      it is not the turning over of an oyster-shell, but the conversion of a
      soul from night to day, from becoming to being. And what training will
      draw the soul upwards? Our former education had two branches, gymnastic,
      which was occupied with the body, and music, the sister art, which infused
      <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage522A" class="pginternal">522</a></span>a natural harmony into mind and literature; but neither of these sciences
      gave any promise of doing what we want. Nothing remains to us but that
      universal or primary science of which all the arts and sciences are
      partakers, I mean number or calculation. ‘Very true.’ Including the art of
      war? ‘Yes, certainly.’ Then there is something ludicrous about Palamedes
      in the tragedy, coming in and saying that he had invented number, and had
      counted the ranks and set them in order. For if Agamemnon could not count
      his feet (and without number how could he?) he must have been a pretty
      sort of general indeed. No man should be a soldier who cannot count, and
      indeed he is hardly to be called a man. But I am not speaking of these
      practical applications of arithmetic, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage523A" class="pginternal">523</a></span>for number, in my view, is rather to
      be regarded as a conductor to thought and being. I will explain <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecii"></a>cii</span> what I
      mean by the last expression:—Things sensible are of two kinds; the
      one class invite or stimulate the mind, while in the other the mind
      acquiesces. Now the stimulating class are the things which suggest
      contrast and relation. For example, suppose that I hold up to the eyes
      three fingers—a fore finger, a middle finger, a little finger—the
      sight equally recognizes all three fingers, but without number cannot
      further distinguish them. Or again, suppose two objects to be relatively
      great and small, these ideas of greatness and smallness are supplied not
      by the sense, but by the mind. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage524A" class="pginternal">524</a></span>And the perception of their contrast or
      relation quickens and sets in motion the mind, which is puzzled by the
      confused intimations of sense, and has recourse to number in order to find
      out whether the things indicated are one or more than one. Number replies
      that they are two and not one, and are to be distinguished from one
      another. Again, the sight beholds great and small, but only in a confused
      chaos, and not until they are distinguished does the question arise of
      their respective natures; we are thus led on to the distinction between
      the visible and intelligible. That was what I meant when I spoke of
      stimulants to the intellect; I was thinking of the contradictions which
      arise in perception. The idea of unity, for example, like that of a
      finger, does not arouse thought unless involving some conception of
      plurality; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage525A" class="pginternal">525</a></span>but when the one is also the opposite of one, the contradiction
      gives rise to reflection; an example of this is afforded by any object of
      sight. All number has also an elevating effect; it raises the mind out of
      the foam and flux of generation to the contemplation of being, having
      lesser military and retail uses also. The retail use is not required by
      us; but as our guardian is to be a soldier as well as a philosopher, the
      military one may be retained. And to our higher purpose no science can be
      better adapted; but it must be pursued in the spirit of a philosopher, not
      of a shopkeeper. It is concerned, not with visible objects, but with
      abstract truth; for numbers are pure abstractions—the true
      arithmetician indignantly denies that his unit is capable of division.
      <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage526A" class="pginternal">526</a></span>When you divide, he insists that you are only multiplying; his ‘one’ is
      not material or resolvable into fractions, but an unvarying and absolute
      equality; and this proves the purely intellectual character of his study.
      Note also the great power which arithmetic has of sharpening the wits; no
      other discipline is equally <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageciii"></a>ciii</span> severe, or an equal test of general ability,
      or equally improving to a stupid person.
    </p>
<p>
      Let our second branch of education be geometry. ‘I can easily see,’
      replied Glaucon, ‘that the skill of the general will be doubled by his
      knowledge of geometry.’ That is a small matter; the use of geometry, to
      which I refer, is the assistance given by it in the contemplation of the
      idea of good, and the compelling the mind to look at true being, and not
      at generation only. Yet the present mode of pursuing these studies, as any
      one who is the least of a mathematician is aware, is mean and ridiculous;
      they are made to look downwards to the arts, and not upwards to eternal
      existence. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage527A" class="pginternal">527</a></span>The geometer is always talking of squaring, subtending,
      apposing, as if he had in view action; whereas knowledge is the real
      object of the study. It should elevate the soul, and create the mind of
      philosophy; it should raise up what has fallen down, not to speak of
      lesser uses in war and military tactics, and in the improvement of the
      faculties.
    </p>
<p>
      Shall we propose, as a third branch of our education, astronomy? ‘Very
      good,’ replied Glaucon; ‘the knowledge of the heavens is necessary at once
      for husbandry, navigation, military tactics.’ I like your way of giving
      useful reasons for everything in order to make friends of the world. And
      there is a difficulty in proving to mankind that education is not only
      useful information but a purification of the eye of the soul, which is
      better than the bodily eye, for by this alone is truth seen. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage528A" class="pginternal">528</a></span>Now, will you
      appeal to mankind in general or to the philosopher? or would you prefer to
      look to yourself only? ‘Every man is his own best friend.’ Then take a
      step backward, for we are out of order, and insert the third dimension
      which is of solids, after the second which is of planes, and then you may
      proceed to solids in motion. But solid geometry is not popular and has not
      the patronage of the State, nor is the use of it fully recognized; the
      difficulty is great, and the votaries of the study are conceited and
      impatient. Still the charm of the pursuit wins upon men, and, if
      government would lend a little assistance, there might be great progress
      made. ‘Very true,’ replied Glaucon; ‘but do I understand you now to begin
      with plane geometry, and to place next geometry of solids, and thirdly,
      astronomy, or the motion of solids?’ Yes, I said; my hastiness has only
      hindered us.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageciv"></a>civ</span> ‘Very good, and now let us proceed to astronomy, about which I am willing
      to speak in your lofty strain. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage529A" class="pginternal">529</a></span>No one can fail to see that the
      contemplation of the heavens draws the soul upwards.’ I am an exception,
      then; astronomy as studied at present appears to me to draw the soul not
      upwards, but downwards. Star-gazing is just looking up at the ceiling—no
      better; a man may lie on his back on land or on water—he may look up
      or look down, but there is no science in that. The vision of knowledge of
      which I speak is seen not with the eyes, but with the mind. All the
      magnificence of the heavens is but the embroidery of a copy which falls
      far short of the divine Original, and teaches nothing about the absolute
      harmonies or motions of things. Their beauty is like the beauty of figures
      drawn by the hand of Daedalus or any other great artist, which may be used
      for illustration, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage530A" class="pginternal">530</a></span>but no mathematician would seek to obtain from them true
      conceptions of equality or numerical relations. How ridiculous then to
      look for these in the map of the heavens, in which the imperfection of
      matter comes in everywhere as a disturbing element, marring the symmetry
      of day and night, of months and years, of the sun and stars in their
      courses. Only by problems can we place astronomy on a truly scientific
      basis. Let the heavens alone, and exert the intellect.
    </p>
<p>
      Still, mathematics admit of other applications, as the Pythagoreans say,
      and we agree. There is a sister science of harmonical motion, adapted to
      the ear as astronomy is to the eye, and there may be other applications
      also. Let us inquire of the Pythagoreans about them, not forgetting that
      we have an aim higher than theirs, which is the relation of these sciences
      to the idea of good. The error which pervades astronomy also pervades
      harmonics. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage531A" class="pginternal">531</a></span>The musicians put their ears in the place of their minds.
      ‘Yes,’ replied Glaucon, ‘I like to see them laying their ears alongside of
      their neighbours’ faces—some saying, “That’s a new note,” others
      declaring that the two notes are the same.’ Yes, I said; but you mean the
      empirics who are always twisting and torturing the strings of the lyre,
      and quarrelling about the tempers of the strings; I am referring rather to
      the Pythagorean harmonists, who are almost equally in error. For they
      investigate only the numbers of the consonances which are heard, and
      ascend no higher,—of the true numerical harmony which is unheard,
      and is only to be found in problems, they have not even a conception.
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecv"></a>cv</span> ‘That last,’ he said, ‘must be a marvellous thing.’ A thing, I replied,
      which is only useful if pursued with a view to the good.
    </p>
<p>
      All these sciences are the prelude of the strain, and are profitable if
      they are regarded in their natural relations to one another. ‘I dare say,
      Socrates,’ said Glaucon; ‘but such a study will be an endless business.’
      What study do you mean—of the prelude, or what? For all these things
      are only the prelude, and you surely do not suppose that a mere
      mathematician is also a dialectician? ‘Certainly not. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage532A" class="pginternal">532</a></span>I have hardly ever
      known a mathematician who could reason.’ And yet, Glaucon, is not true
      reasoning that hymn of dialectic which is the music of the intellectual
      world, and which was by us compared to the effort of sight, when from
      beholding the shadows on the wall we arrived at last at the images which
      gave the shadows? Even so the dialectical faculty withdrawing from sense
      arrives by the pure intellect at the contemplation of the idea of good,
      and never rests but at the very end of the intellectual world. And the
      royal road out of the cave into the light, and the blinking of the eyes at
      the sun and turning to contemplate the shadows of reality, not the shadows
      of an image only—this progress and gradual acquisition of a new
      faculty of sight by the help of the mathematical sciences, is the
      elevation of the soul to the contemplation of the highest ideal of being.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘So far, I agree with you. But now, leaving the prelude, let us proceed to
      the hymn. What, then, is the nature of dialectic, and what are the paths
      which lead thither?’ <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage533A" class="pginternal">533</a></span>Dear Glaucon, you cannot follow me here. There can be
      no revelation of the absolute truth to one who has not been disciplined in
      the previous sciences. But that there is a science of absolute truth,
      which is attained in some way very different from those now practised, I
      am confident. For all other arts or sciences are relative to human needs
      and opinions; and the mathematical sciences are but a dream or hypothesis
      of true being, and never analyse their own principles. Dialectic alone
      rises to the principle which is above hypotheses, converting and gently
      leading the eye of the soul out of the barbarous slough of ignorance into
      the light of the upper world, with the help of the sciences which we have
      been describing—sciences, as they are often termed, although they
      require some other name, implying greater clearness than opinion and less
      clearness than science, and this in our previous sketch <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecvi"></a>cvi</span> was understanding.
      And so we get four names—two for intellect, and two for opinion,—reason
      or mind, understanding, faith, perception of shadows—which make a
      proportion<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage534A" class="pginternal">534</a></span>—being : becoming :: intellect : opinion—and
      science : belief :: understanding : perception of shadows. Dialectic may be
      further described as that science which defines and explains the essence
      or being of each nature, which distinguishes and abstracts the good, and
      is ready to do battle against all opponents in the cause of good. To him
      who is not a dialectician life is but a sleepy dream; and many a man is in
      his grave before his is well waked up. And would you have the future
      rulers of your ideal State intelligent beings, or stupid as posts?
      ‘Certainly not the latter.’ Then you must train them in dialectic, which
      will teach them to ask and answer questions, and is the coping-stone of
      the sciences.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage535A" class="pginternal">535</a></span>I dare say that you have not forgotten how our rulers were chosen; and the
      process of selection may be carried a step further:—As before, they
      must be constant and valiant, good-looking, and of noble manners, but now
      they must also have natural ability which education will improve; that is
      to say, they must be quick at learning, capable of mental toil, retentive,
      solid, diligent natures, who combine intellectual with moral virtues; not
      lame and one-sided, diligent in bodily exercise and indolent in mind, or
      conversely; not a maimed soul, which hates falsehood and yet
      <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage536A" class="pginternal">536</a></span>unintentionally is always wallowing in the mire of ignorance; not a
      bastard or feeble person, but sound in wind and limb, and in perfect
      condition for the great gymnastic trial of the mind. Justice herself can
      find no fault with natures such as these; and they will be the saviours of
      our State; disciples of another sort would only make philosophy more
      ridiculous than she is at present. Forgive my enthusiasm; I am becoming
      excited; but when I see her trampled underfoot, I am angry at the authors
      of her disgrace. ‘I did not notice that you were more excited than you
      ought to have been.’ But I felt that I was. Now do not let us forget
      another point in the selection of our disciples—that they must be
      young and not old. For Solon is mistaken in saying that an old man can be
      always learning; youth is the time of study, and here we must remember
      that the mind is free and dainty, and, unlike the body, must not be made
      to work against the grain. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage537A" class="pginternal">537</a></span>Learning should be at first a sort of play, in
      which the natural bent <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecvii"></a>cvii</span> is detected. As in training them for war, the young
      dogs should at first only taste blood; but when the necessary gymnastics
      are over which during two or three years divide life between sleep and
      bodily exercise, then the education of the soul will become a more serious
      matter. At twenty years of age, a selection must be made of the more
      promising disciples, with whom a new epoch of education will begin. The
      sciences which they have hitherto learned in fragments will now be brought
      into relation with each other and with true being; for the power of
      combining them is the test of speculative and dialectical ability. And
      afterwards at thirty a further selection shall be made of those who are
      able to withdraw from the world of sense into the abstraction of ideas.
      But at this point, judging from present experience, there is a danger that
      dialectic may be the source of many evils. The danger may be illustrated
      by a parallel case:—Imagine a person who has been brought up in
      wealth and luxury amid a crowd of flatterers, and who is suddenly informed
      that he is a supposititious son. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage538A" class="pginternal">538</a></span>He has hitherto honoured his reputed
      parents and disregarded the flatterers, and now he does the reverse. This
      is just what happens with a man’s principles. There are certain doctrines
      which he learnt at home and which exercised a parental authority over him.
      Presently he finds that imputations are cast upon them; a troublesome
      querist comes and asks, ‘What is the just and good?’ or proves that virtue
      is vice and vice virtue, and his mind becomes unsettled, and he ceases to
      love, honour, and obey them as he has hitherto done. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage539A" class="pginternal">539</a></span>He is seduced into
      the life of pleasure, and becomes a lawless person and a rogue. The case
      of such speculators is very pitiable, and, in order that our thirty years’
      old pupils may not require this pity, let us take every possible care that
      young persons do not study philosophy too early. For a young man is a sort
      of puppy who only plays with an argument; and is reasoned into and out of
      his opinions every day; he soon begins to believe nothing, and brings
      himself and philosophy into discredit. A man of thirty does not run on in
      this way; he will argue and not merely contradict, and adds new honour to
      philosophy by the sobriety of his conduct. What time shall we allow for
      this second gymnastic training of the soul?—say, twice the time
      required for the gymnastics of the body; six, or perhaps five years, to
      commence at thirty, and then for fifteen <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecviii"></a>cviii</span> years let the student go down
      into the den, and command armies, and gain experience of life. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage540A" class="pginternal">540</a></span>At fifty
      let him return to the end of all things, and have his eyes uplifted to the
      idea of good, and order his life after that pattern; if necessary, taking
      his turn at the helm of State, and training up others to be his
      successors. When his time comes he shall depart in peace to the islands of
      the blest. He shall be honoured with sacrifices, and receive such worship
      as the Pythian oracle approves.

      things with the men. And you will admit that our State is not a mere
      aspiration, but may really come into being when there shall arise
      philosopher-kings, one or more, who will despise earthly vanities, and

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic VII.</i><br>I<span class="smcap">NTRODUCTION.</span></span>
      At the commencement of the sixth book, Plato anticipated his explanation
      of the relation of the philosopher to the world in an allegory, in this,
      as in other passages, following the order which he prescribes in
      education, and proceeding from the concrete to the abstract. At the
      commencement of Book VII, under the figure of a cave having an opening
      towards a fire and a way upwards to the true light, he returns to view the
      divisions of knowledge, exhibiting familiarly, as in a picture, the result
      which had been hardly won by a great effort of thought in the previous
      discussion; at the same time casting a glance onward at the dialectical
      process, which is represented by the way leading from darkness to light.
      The shadows, the images, the reflection of the sun and stars in the water,
      the stars and sun themselves, severally correspond,—the first, to
      the realm of fancy and poetry,—the second, to the world of sense,—the
      third, to the abstractions or universals of sense, of which the
      mathematical sciences furnish the type,—the fourth and last to the
      same abstractions, when seen in the unity of the idea, from which they
      derive a new meaning and power. The true dialectical process begins with
      the contemplation of the real stars, and not mere reflections of them, <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecix"></a>cix</span> and
      ends with the recognition of the sun, or idea of good, as the parent not
      only of light but of warmth and growth. To the divisions of knowledge the
      stages of education partly answer:—first, there is the early
      education of childhood and youth in the fancies of the poets, and in the
      laws and customs of the State;—then there is the training of the
      body to be a warrior athlete, and a good servant of the mind;—and
      thirdly, after an interval follows the education of later life, which
      begins with mathematics and proceeds to philosophy in general.
    </p>
<p>
      There seem to be two great aims in the philosophy of Plato,—first,
      to realize abstractions; secondly, to connect them. According to him, the
      true education is that which draws men from becoming to being, and to a
      comprehensive survey of all being. He desires to develop in the human mind
      the faculty of seeing the universal in all things; until at last the
      particulars of sense drop away and the universal alone remains. He then
      seeks to combine the universals which he has disengaged from sense, not
      perceiving that the correlation of them has no other basis but the common
      use of language. He never understands that abstractions, as Hegel says,
      are ‘mere abstractions’—of use when employed in the arrangement of
      facts, but adding nothing to the sum of knowledge when pursued apart from
      them, or with reference to an imaginary idea of good. Still the exercise
      of the faculty of abstraction apart from facts has enlarged the mind, and
      played a great part in the education of the human race. Plato appreciated
      the value of this faculty, and saw that it might be quickened by the study
      of number and relation. All things in which there is opposition or
      proportion are suggestive of reflection. The mere impression of sense
      evokes no power of thought or of mind, but when sensible objects ask to be
      compared and distinguished, then philosophy begins. The science of
      arithmetic first suggests such distinctions. There follow in order the other
      sciences of plain and solid geometry, and of solids in motion, one branch
      of which is astronomy or the harmony of the spheres,—to this is
      appended the sister science of the harmony of sounds. Plato seems also to
      hint at the possibility of other applications of arithmetical or
      mathematical proportions, such as we employ in chemistry and natural
      philosophy, such as the Pythagoreans and even Aristotle make use of in
      Ethics <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecx"></a>cx</span> and Politics, e.g. his distinction between arithmetical and
      geometrical proportion in the Ethics (Book V), or between numerical and
      proportional equality in the Politics (iii. 8, iv. 12, &amp;c.).
    </p>
<p>
      The modern mathematician will readily sympathise with Plato’s delight in
      the properties of pure mathematics. He will not be disinclined to say with
      him:—Let alone the heavens, and study the beauties of number and
      figure in themselves. He too will be apt to depreciate their application
      to the arts. He will observe that Plato has a conception of geometry, in
      which figures are to be dispensed with; thus in a distant and shadowy way
      seeming to anticipate the possibility of working geometrical problems by a
      more general mode of analysis. He will remark with interest on the
      backward state of solid geometry, which, alas! was not encouraged by the
      aid of the State in the age of Plato; and he will recognize the grasp of
      Plato’s mind in his ability to conceive of one science of solids in motion
      including the earth as well as the heavens,—not forgetting to notice
      the intimation to which allusion has been already made, that besides
      astronomy and harmonics the science of solids in motion may have other
      applications. Still more will he be struck with the comprehensiveness of
      view which led Plato, at a time when these sciences hardly existed, to say
      that they must be studied in relation to one another, and to the idea of
      good, or common principle of truth and being. But he will also see (and
      perhaps without surprise) that in that stage of physical and mathematical
      knowledge, Plato has fallen into the error of supposing that he can
      construct the heavens <i>a priori</i> by mathematical problems, and determine the
      principles of harmony irrespective of the adaptation of sounds to the
      human ear. The illusion was a natural one in that age and country. The
      simplicity and certainty of astronomy and harmonics seemed to contrast
      with the variation and complexity of the world of sense; hence the
      circumstance that there was some elementary basis of fact, some
      measurement of distance or time or vibrations on which they must
      ultimately rest, was overlooked by him. The modern predecessors of Newton
      fell into errors equally great; and Plato can hardly be said to have been
      very far wrong, or may even claim a sort of prophetic insight into the
      subject, when we consider that the greater part of astronomy at the
      present day consists of abstract dynamics, <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxi"></a>cxi</span> by the help of which most
      astronomical discoveries have been made.
    </p>
<p>
      The metaphysical philosopher from his point of view recognizes mathematics
      as an instrument of education,—which strengthens the power of
      attention, developes the sense of order and the faculty of construction,
      and enables the mind to grasp under simple formulae the quantitative
      differences of physical phenomena. But while acknowledging their value in
      education, he sees also that they have no connexion with our higher moral
      and intellectual ideas. In the attempt which Plato makes to connect them,
      we easily trace the influences of ancient Pythagorean notions. There is no
      reason to suppose that he is speaking of the ideal numbers at p. <a href="#stpage525E" class="pginternal">525 E</a>; but he is
      describing numbers which are pure abstractions, to which he assigns a real
      and separate existence, which, as ‘the teachers of the art’ (meaning
      probably the Pythagoreans) would have affirmed, repel all attempts at
      subdivision, and in which unity and every other number are conceived of as
      absolute. The truth and certainty of numbers, when thus disengaged from
      phenomena, gave them a kind of sacredness in the eyes of an ancient
      philosopher. Nor is it easy to say how far ideas of order and fixedness
      may have had a moral and elevating influence on the minds of men, ‘who,’
      in the words of the Timaeus, ‘might learn to regulate their erring lives
      according to them’ (47 C). It is worthy of remark that the old Pythagorean
      ethical symbols still exist as figures of speech among ourselves. And
      those who in modern times see the world pervaded by universal law, may
      also see an anticipation of this last word of modern philosophy in the
      Platonic idea of good, which is the source and measure of all things, and
      yet only an abstraction. (Cp. Philebus sub fin.).
    </p>
<p>
      Two passages seem to require more particular explanations. First, that
      which relates to the analysis of vision. The difficulty in this passage
      may be explained, like many others, from differences in the modes of
      conception prevailing among ancient and modern thinkers. To us, the
      perceptions of sense are inseparable from the act of the mind which
      accompanies them. The consciousness of form, colour, distance, is
      indistinguishable from the simple sensation, which is the medium of them.
      Whereas to Plato sense is the Heraclitean flux of sense, not <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxii"></a>cxii</span> the vision of
      objects in the order in which they actually present themselves to the
      experienced sight, but as they may be imagined to appear confused and
      blurred to the half-awakened eye of the infant. The first action of the
      mind is aroused by the attempt to set in order this chaos, and the reason
      is required to frame distinct conceptions under which the confused
      impressions of sense may be arranged. Hence arises the question, ‘What is
      great, what is small?’ and thus begins the distinction of the visible and
      the intelligible.
    </p>
<p>
      The second difficulty relates to Plato’s conception of harmonics. Three
      classes of harmonists are distinguished by him:—first, the
      Pythagoreans, whom he proposes to consult as in the previous discussion on
      music he was to consult Damon—they are acknowledged to be masters in
      the art, but are altogether deficient in the knowledge of its higher
      import and relation to the good; secondly, the mere empirics, whom Glaucon
      appears to confuse with them, and whom both he and Socrates ludicrously
      describe as experimenting by mere auscultation on the intervals of sounds.
      Both of these fall short in different degrees of the Platonic idea of
      harmony, which must be studied in a purely abstract way, first by the
      method of problems, and secondly as a part of universal knowledge in
      relation to the idea of good.
    </p>
<p>
      The allegory has a political as well as a philosophical meaning. The den
      or cave represents the narrow sphere of politics or law (cp. the description of the philosopher and lawyer in the Theaetetus, 172–176), and the
      light of the eternal ideas is supposed to exercise a disturbing influence
      on the minds of those who return to this lower world. In other words,
      their principles are too wide for practical application; they are looking
      far away into the past and future, when their business is with the
      present. The ideal is not easily reduced to the conditions of actual life,
      and may often be at variance with them. And at first, those who return are
      unable to compete with the inhabitants of the den in the measurement of
      the shadows, and are derided and persecuted by them; but after a while
      they see the things below in far truer proportions than those who have
      never ascended into the upper world. The difference between the politician
      turned into a philosopher and the philosopher turned into a politician, is
      symbolized by the two kinds of disordered eyesight, <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxiii"></a>cxiii</span> the one which is
      experienced by the captive who is transferred from darkness to day, the
      other, of the heavenly messenger who voluntarily for the good of his
      fellow-men descends into the den. In what way the brighter light is to
      dawn on the inhabitants of the lower world, or how the idea of good is to
      become the guiding principle of politics, is left unexplained by Plato.
      Like the nature and divisions of dialectic, of which Glaucon impatiently
      demands to be informed, perhaps he would have said that the explanation
      could not be given except to a disciple of the previous sciences.
      (Compare Symposium 210 A.)
    </p>
<p>
      Many illustrations of this part of the Republic may be found in modern
      Politics and in daily life. For among ourselves, too, there have been two
      sorts of Politicians or Statesmen, whose eyesight has become disordered in
      two different ways. First, there have been great men who, in the language
      of Burke, ‘have been too much given to general maxims,’ who, like J. S.
      Mill or Burke himself, have been theorists or philosophers before they
      were politicians, or who, having been students of history, have allowed
      some great historical parallel, such as the English Revolution of 1688, or
      possibly Athenian democracy or Roman Imperialism, to be the medium through
      which they viewed contemporary events. Or perhaps the long projecting
      shadow of some existing institution may have darkened their vision. The
      Church of the future, the Commonwealth of the future, the Society of the
      future, have so absorbed their minds, that they are unable to see in their
      true proportions the Politics of to-day. They have been intoxicated with
      great ideas, such as liberty, or equality, or the greatest happiness of
      the greatest number, or the brotherhood of humanity, and they no longer
      care to consider how these ideas must be limited in practice or harmonized
      with the conditions of human life. They are full of light, but the light
      to them has become only a sort of luminous mist or blindness. Almost every
      one has known some enthusiastic half-educated person, who sees everything
      at false distances, and in erroneous proportions.
    </p>
<p>
      With this disorder of eyesight may be contrasted another—of those
      who see not far into the distance, but what is near only; who have been
      engaged all their lives in a trade or a profession; who are limited to a
      set or sect of their own. Men of this kind <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxiv"></a>cxiv</span> have no universal except their
      own interests or the interests of their class, no principle but the
      opinion of persons like themselves, no knowledge of affairs beyond what
      they pick up in the streets or at their club. Suppose them to be sent into
      a larger world, to undertake some higher calling, from being tradesmen to
      turn generals or politicians, from being schoolmasters to become
      philosophers:—or imagine them on a sudden to receive an inward light
      which reveals to them for the first time in their lives a higher idea of
      God and the existence of a spiritual world, by this sudden conversion or
      change is not their daily life likely to be upset; and on the other hand
      will not many of their old prejudices and narrownesses still adhere to
      them long after they have begun to take a more comprehensive view of human
      things? From familiar examples like these we may learn what Plato meant by
      the eyesight which is liable to two kinds of disorders.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor have we any difficulty in drawing a parallel between the young
      Athenian in the fifth century before Christ who became unsettled by new
      ideas, and the student of a modern University who has been the subject of
      a similar ‘aufklärung.’ We too observe that when young men begin to
      criticise customary beliefs, or to analyse the constitution of human
      nature, they are apt to lose hold of solid principle (<span class="transl" title="a(/pan to\ be/baion au)tô=n e)xoi/chetai">ἅπαν τὸ βέβαιον αὐτῶν ἐξοίχεται</span>). They are
      like trees which have been frequently transplanted. The earth about them
      is loose, and they have no roots reaching far into the soil. They ‘light
      upon every flower,’ following their own wayward wills, or because the wind
      blows them. They catch opinions, as diseases are caught—when they
      are in the air. Borne hither and thither, ‘they speedily fall into
      beliefs’ the opposite of those in which they were brought up. They hardly
      retain the distinction of right and wrong; they seem to think one thing as
      good as another. They suppose themselves to be searching after truth when
      they are playing the game of ‘follow my leader.’ They fall in love ‘at
      first sight’ with paradoxes respecting morality, some fancy about art,
      some novelty or eccentricity in religion, and like lovers they are so
      absorbed for a time in their new notion that they can think of nothing
      else. The resolution of some philosophical or theological question seems
      to them more interesting and important than any substantial knowledge of
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxv"></a>cxv</span> literature or science or even than a good life. Like the youth in the
      Philebus, they are ready to discourse to any one about a new philosophy.
      They are generally the disciples of some eminent professor or sophist,
      whom they rather imitate than understand. They may be counted happy if in
      later years they retain some of the simple truths which they acquired in
      early education, and which they may, perhaps, find to be worth all the
      rest. Such is the picture which Plato draws and which we only reproduce,
      partly in his own words, of the dangers which beset youth in times of
      transition, when old opinions are fading away and the new are not yet
      firmly established. Their condition is ingeniously compared by him to that
      of a supposititious son, who has made the discovery that his reputed
      parents are not his real ones, and, in consequence, they have lost their
      authority over him.
    </p>
<p>
      The distinction between the mathematician and the dialectician is also
      noticeable. Plato is very well aware that the faculty of the mathematician
      is quite distinct from the higher philosophical sense which recognizes and
      combines first principles (<a href="#stpage531E" class="pginternal">531 E</a>). The contempt which he expresses at p. <a href="#stpage533A" class="pginternal">533</a> for
      distinctions of words, the danger of involuntary falsehood, the apology
      which Socrates makes for his earnestness of speech, are highly
      characteristic of the Platonic style and mode of thought. The quaint
      notion that if Palamedes was the inventor of number Agamemnon could not
      have counted his feet; the art by which we are made to believe that this
      State of ours is not a dream only; the gravity with which the first step
      is taken in the actual creation of the State, namely, the sending out of
      the city all who had arrived at ten years of age, in order to expedite the
      business of education by a generation, are also truly Platonic. (For the
      last, compare the passage at the end of the third book (<a href="#stpage415D" class="pginternal">415 D</a>), in which he
      expects the lie about the earthborn men to be believed in the second
      generation.)
    </p>
<p> </p>
<p id="iaVIII"><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic VIII.</i><br>A<span class="smcap">NALYSIS.</span></span>
<b>BOOK VIII.</b> <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage543A" class="pginternal">543</a></span>And so we have arrived at the conclusion, that in the perfect
      State wives and children are to be in common; and the education and
      pursuits of men and women, both in war and peace, are to be common, and
      kings are to be philosophers and warriors, and the soldiers of the State
      are to live together, <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxvi"></a>cxvi</span> having all things in common; and they are to be
      warrior athletes, receiving no pay but only their food, from the other
      citizens. Now let us return to the point at which we digressed. ‘That is
      easily done,’ he replied: ‘You were speaking of the State which you had
      constructed, and of the individual who answered to this, both of whom you
      affirmed to be good; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage544A" class="pginternal">544</a></span>and you said that of inferior States there were four
      forms and four individuals corresponding to them, which although deficient
      in various degrees, were all of them worth inspecting with a view to
      determining the relative happiness or misery of the best or worst man.
      Then Polemarchus and Adeimantus interrupted you, and this led to another
      argument,—and so here we are.’ Suppose that we put ourselves again
      in the same position, and do you repeat your question. ‘I should like to
      know of what constitutions you were speaking?’ Besides the perfect State
      there are only four of any note in Hellas:—first, the famous
      Lacedaemonian or Cretan commonwealth; secondly, oligarchy, a State full of
      evils; thirdly, democracy, which follows next in order; fourthly, tyranny,
      which is the disease or death of all government. Now, States are not made
      of ‘oak and rock,’ but of flesh and blood; and therefore as there are five
      States there must be five human natures in individuals, which correspond
      to them. And first, there is the ambitious nature, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage545A" class="pginternal">545</a></span>which answers to the
      Lacedaemonian State; secondly, the oligarchical nature; thirdly, the
      democratical; and fourthly, the tyrannical. This last will have to be
      compared with the perfectly just, which is the fifth, that we may know
      which is the happier, and then we shall be able to determine whether the
      argument of Thrasymachus or our own is the more convincing. And as before
      we began with the State and went on to the individual, so now, beginning
      with timocracy, let us go on to the timocratical man, and then proceed to
      the other forms of government, and the individuals who answer to them.
    </p>
<p>
      But how did timocracy arise out of the perfect State? Plainly, like all
      changes of government, from division in the rulers. But whence came
      division? ‘Sing, heavenly Muses,’ as Homer says;—let them condescend
      to answer us, as if we were children, to whom they put on a solemn face in
      jest. ‘And what will they say?’ <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage546A" class="pginternal">546</a></span>They will say that human things are fated
      to decay, and even the perfect State will not escape from this law of
      destiny, <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxvii"></a>cxvii</span> when ‘the wheel comes full circle’ in a period short or long.
      Plants or animals have times of fertility and sterility, which the
      intelligence of rulers because alloyed by sense will not enable them to
      ascertain, and children will be born out of season. For whereas divine
      creations are in a perfect cycle or number, the human creation is in a
      number which declines from perfection, and has four terms and three
      intervals of numbers, increasing, waning, assimilating, dissimilating, and
      yet perfectly commensurate with each other. The base of the number with a
      fourth added (or which is 3 : 4), multiplied by five and cubed, gives two
      harmonies:—the first a square number, which is a hundred times the
      base (or a hundred times a hundred); the second, an oblong, being a
      hundred squares of the rational diameter of a figure the side of which is
      five, subtracting one from each square or two perfect squares from all,
      and adding a hundred cubes of three. This entire number is geometrical and
      contains the rule or law of generation. When this law is neglected
      marriages will be unpropitious; the inferior offspring who are then born
      will in time become the rulers; the State will decline, and education fall
      into decay; gymnastic will be preferred to music, and the gold and silver
      and brass and iron will form a chaotic mass—<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage547A" class="pginternal">547</a></span>thus division will
      arise. Such is the Muses’ answer to our question. ‘And a true answer, of
      course:—but what more have they to say?’ They say that the two
      races, the iron and brass, and the silver and gold, will draw the State
      different ways;—the one will take to trade and moneymaking, and the
      others, having the true riches and not caring for money, will resist them:
      the contest will end in a compromise; they will agree to have private
      property, and will enslave their fellow-citizens who were once their
      friends and nurturers. But they will retain their warlike character, and
      will be chiefly occupied in fighting and exercising rule. Thus arises
      timocracy, which is intermediate between aristocracy and oligarchy.
    </p>
<p>
      The new form of government resembles the ideal in obedience to rulers and
      contempt for trade, and having common meals, and in devotion to warlike
      and gymnastic exercises. But corruption has crept into philosophy, and
      simplicity of character, which was once her note, is now looked for only
      in the military class. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage548A" class="pginternal">548</a></span>Arts of war begin to prevail over arts of peace;
      the ruler is no longer a <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxviii"></a>cxviii</span> philosopher; as in oligarchies, there springs up
      among them an extravagant love of gain—get another man’s and save
      your own, is their principle; and they have dark places in which they
      hoard their gold and silver, for the use of their women and others; they
      take their pleasures by stealth, like boys who are running away from their
      father—the law; and their education is not inspired by the Muse, but
      imposed by the strong arm of power. The leading characteristic of this
      State is party spirit and ambition.
    </p>
<p>
      And what manner of man answers to such a State? ‘In love of contention,’
      replied Adeimantus, ‘he will be like our friend Glaucon.’ In that respect,
      perhaps, but not in others. He is self-asserting and ill-educated, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage549A" class="pginternal">549</a></span>yet
      fond of literature, although not himself a speaker,—fierce with
      slaves, but obedient to rulers, a lover of power and honour, which he
      hopes to gain by deeds of arms,—fond, too, of gymnastics and of
      hunting. As he advances in years he grows avaricious, for he has lost
      philosophy, which is the only saviour and guardian of men. His origin is
      as follows:—His father is a good man dwelling in an ill-ordered
      State, who has retired from politics in order that he may lead a quiet
      life. His mother is angry at her loss of precedence among other women; she
      is disgusted at her husband’s selfishness, and she expatiates to her son
      on the unmanliness and indolence of his father. The old family servant
      takes up the tale, and says to the youth:—‘When you grow up you must
      be more of a man than your father.’ <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage550A" class="pginternal">550</a></span>All the world are agreed that he who
      minds his own business is an idiot, while a busybody is highly honoured
      and esteemed. The young man compares this spirit with his father’s words
      and ways, and as he is naturally well disposed, although he has suffered
      from evil influences, he rests at a middle point and becomes ambitious and
      a lover of honour.
    </p>
<p>
      And now let us set another city over against another man. The next form of
      government is oligarchy, in which the rule is of the rich only; nor is it
      difficult to see how such a State arises. The decline begins with the
      possession of gold and silver; illegal modes of expenditure are invented;
      one draws another on, and the multitude are infected; riches outweigh
      virtue; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage551A" class="pginternal">551</a></span>lovers of money take the place of lovers of honour; misers of
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxix"></a>cxix</span> politicians; and, in time, political privileges are confined by law to the
      rich, who do not shrink from violence in order to effect their purposes.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus much of the origin,—let us next consider the evils of
      oligarchy. Would a man who wanted to be safe on a voyage take a bad pilot
      because he was rich, or refuse a good one because he was poor? And does
      not the analogy apply still more to the State? And there are yet greater
      evils: two nations are struggling together in one—the rich and the
      poor; and the rich dare not put arms into the hands of the poor, and are
      unwilling to pay for defenders out of their own money. And have we not
      already condemned that State <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage552A" class="pginternal">552</a></span>in which the same persons are warriors as
      well as shopkeepers? The greatest evil of all is that a man may sell his
      property and have no place in the State; while there is one class which
      has enormous wealth, the other is entirely destitute. But observe that
      these destitutes had not really any more of the governing nature in them
      when they were rich than now that they are poor; they were miserable
      spendthrifts always. They are the drones of the hive; only whereas the
      actual drone is unprovided by nature with a sting, the two-legged things
      whom we call drones are some of them without stings and some of them have
      dreadful stings; in other words, there are paupers and there are rogues.
      These are never far apart; and in oligarchical cities, where nearly
      everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler, you will find abundance of both.
      And this evil state of society originates in bad education and bad
      government.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage553A" class="pginternal">553</a></span>Like State, like man,—the change in the latter begins with the
      representative of timocracy; he walks at first in the ways of his father,
      who may have been a statesman, or general, perhaps; and presently he sees
      him ‘fallen from his high estate,’ the victim of informers, dying in
      prison or exile, or by the hand of the executioner. The lesson which he
      thus receives, makes him cautious; he leaves politics, represses his
      pride, and saves pence. Avarice is enthroned as his bosom’s lord, and
      assumes the style of the Great King; the rational and spirited elements
      sit humbly on the ground at either side, the one immersed in calculation,
      the other absorbed in the admiration of wealth. The love of honour turns
      to love of money; the conversion is instantaneous. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxx"></a>cxx</span> man is mean,
      saving, toiling, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage554A" class="pginternal">554</a></span>the slave of one passion which is the master of the rest:
      Is he not the very image of the State? He has had no education, or he
      would never have allowed the blind god of riches to lead the dance within
      him. And being uneducated he will have many slavish desires, some
      beggarly, some knavish, breeding in his soul. If he is the trustee of an
      orphan, and has the power to defraud, he will soon prove that he is not
      without the will, and that his passions are only restrained by fear and
      not by reason. Hence he leads a divided existence; in which the better
      desires mostly prevail. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage555A" class="pginternal">555</a></span>But when he is contending for prizes and other
      distinctions, he is afraid to incur a loss which is to be repaid only by
      barren honour; in time of war he fights with a small part of his
      resources, and usually keeps his money and loses the victory.
    </p>
<p>
      Next comes democracy and the democratic man, out of oligarchy and the
      oligarchical man. Insatiable avarice is the ruling passion of an
      oligarchy; and they encourage expensive habits in order that they may gain
      by the ruin of extravagant youth. Thus men of family often lose their
      property or rights of citizenship; but they remain in the city, full of
      hatred against the new owners of their estates and ripe for revolution.
      The usurer with stooping walk pretends not to see them; he passes by, and
      leaves his sting—that is, his money—in some other victim; and
      many a man has to pay the parent or principal sum multiplied into a family
      of children, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage556A" class="pginternal">556</a></span>and is reduced into a state of dronage by him. The only way
      of diminishing the evil is either to limit a man in his use of his
      property, or to insist that he shall lend at his own risk. But the ruling
      class do not want remedies; they care only for money, and are as careless
      of virtue as the poorest of the citizens. Now there are occasions on which
      the governors and the governed meet together,—at festivals, on a
      journey, voyaging or fighting. The sturdy pauper finds that in the hour of
      danger he is not despised; he sees the rich man puffing and panting, and
      draws the conclusion which he privately imparts to his companions,—‘that
      our people are not good for much;’ and as a sickly frame is made ill by a
      mere touch from without, or sometimes without external impulse is ready to
      fall to pieces of itself, so from the least cause, or with none at all,
      the city falls ill and fights a battle for life or death. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage557A" class="pginternal">557</a></span>And democracy
      comes into <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxi"></a>cxxi</span> power when the poor are the victors, killing some and exiling
      some, and giving equal shares in the government to all the rest.
    </p>
<p>
      The manner of life in such a State is that of democrats; there is freedom
      and plainness of speech, and every man does what is right in his own eyes,
      and has his own way of life. Hence arise the most various developments of
      character; the State is like a piece of embroidery of which the colours
      and figures are the manners of men, and there are many who, like women and
      children, prefer this variety to real beauty and excellence. The State is
      not one but many, like a bazaar at which you can buy anything. The great
      charm is, that you may do as you like; you may govern if you like, let it
      alone if you like; go to war and make peace if you feel disposed, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage558A" class="pginternal">558</a></span>and all
      quite irrespective of anybody else. When you condemn men to death they
      remain alive all the same; a gentleman is desired to go into exile, and he
      stalks about the streets like a hero; and nobody sees him or cares for
      him. Observe, too, how grandly Democracy sets her foot upon all our fine
      theories of education,—how little she cares for the training of her
      statesmen! The only qualification which she demands is the profession of
      patriotism. Such is democracy;—a pleasing, lawless, various sort of
      government, distributing equality to equals and unequals alike.
    </p>
<p>
      Let us now inspect the individual democrat; and first, as in the case of
      the State, we will trace his antecedents. He is the son of a miserly
      oligarch, and has been taught by him to restrain the love of unnecessary
      pleasures. Perhaps I ought to explain this latter term:—<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage559A" class="pginternal">559</a></span>Necessary
      pleasures are those which are good, and which we cannot do without;
      unnecessary pleasures are those which do no good, and of which the desire
      might be eradicated by early training. For example, the pleasures of
      eating and drinking are necessary and healthy, up to a certain point;
      beyond that point they are alike hurtful to body and mind, and the excess
      may be avoided. When in excess, they may be rightly called expensive
      pleasures, in opposition to the useful ones. And the drone, as we called
      him, is the slave of these unnecessary pleasures and desires, whereas the
      miserly oligarch is subject only to the necessary.
    </p>
<p>
      The oligarch changes into the democrat in the following manner:—The
      youth who has had a miserly bringing up, gets <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxii"></a>cxxii</span> a taste of the drone’s
      honey; he meets with wild companions, who introduce him to every new
      pleasure. As in the State, so in the individual, there are allies on both
      sides, temptations from without and passions from within; there is reason
      also and external influences of parents and friends in alliance with the
      oligarchical principle; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage560A" class="pginternal">560</a></span>and the two factions are in violent conflict with
      one another. Sometimes the party of order prevails, but then again new
      desires and new disorders arise, and the whole mob of passions gets
      possession of the Acropolis, that is to say, the soul, which they find
      void and unguarded by true words and works. Falsehoods and illusions
      ascend to take their place; the prodigal goes back into the country of the
      Lotophagi or drones, and openly dwells there. And if any offer of alliance
      or parley of individual elders comes from home, the false spirits shut the
      gates of the castle and permit no one to enter,—there is a battle,
      and they gain the victory; and straightway making alliance with the
      desires, they banish modesty, which they call folly, and send temperance
      over the border. When the house has been swept and garnished, they dress
      up the exiled vices, and, crowning them with garlands, bring them back
      under new names. Insolence they call good breeding, anarchy freedom, waste
      magnificence, impudence courage. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage561A" class="pginternal">561</a></span>Such is the process by which the youth
      passes from the necessary pleasures to the unnecessary. After a while he
      divides his time impartially between them; and perhaps, when he gets older
      and the violence of passion has abated, he restores some of the exiles and
      lives in a sort of equilibrium, indulging first one pleasure and then
      another; and if reason comes and tells him that some pleasures are good
      and honourable, and others bad and vile, he shakes his head and says that
      he can make no distinction between them. Thus he lives in the fancy of the
      hour; sometimes he takes to drink, and then he turns abstainer; he
      practises in the gymnasium or he does nothing at all; then again he would
      be a philosopher or a politician; or again, he would be a warrior or a man
      of business; he is

<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage562A" class="pginternal">562</a></span>There remains still the finest and fairest of all men and all States—tyranny
      and the tyrant. Tyranny springs from democracy much as democracy springs
      from oligarchy. Both arise <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxiii"></a>cxxiii</span> from excess; the one from excess of wealth, the
      other from excess of freedom. ‘The great natural good of life,’ says the
      democrat, ‘is freedom.’ And this exclusive love of freedom and
      regardlessness of everything else, is the cause of the change from
      democracy to tyranny. The State demands the strong wine of freedom, and
      unless her rulers give her a plentiful draught, punishes and insults them;
      equality and fraternity of governors and governed is the approved
      principle. Anarchy is the law, not of the State only, but of private
      houses, and extends even to the animals. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage563A" class="pginternal">563</a></span>Father and son, citizen and
      foreigner, teacher and pupil, old and young, are all on a level; fathers
      and teachers fear their sons and pupils, and the wisdom of the young man
      is a match for the elder, and the old imitate the jaunty manners of the
      young because they are afraid of being thought morose. Slaves are on a
      level with their masters and mistresses, and there is no difference
      between men and women. Nay, the very animals in a democratic State have a
      freedom which is unknown in other places. The she-dogs are as good as
      their she-mistresses, and horses and asses march along with dignity and
      run their noses against anybody who comes in their way. ‘That has often
      been my experience.’ At last the citizens become so sensitive that they
      cannot endure the yoke of laws, written or unwritten; they would have no
      man call himself their master. Such is the glorious beginning of things
      out of which tyranny springs. ‘Glorious, indeed; but what is to follow?’
      The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage564A" class="pginternal">564</a></span>for there is a law of
      contraries; the excess of freedom passes into the excess of slavery, and
      the greater the freedom the greater the slavery. You will remember that in
      the oligarchy were found two classes—rogues and paupers, whom we
      compared to drones with and without stings. These two classes are to the
      State what phlegm and bile are to the human body; and the State-physician,
      or legislator, must get rid of them, just as the bee-master keeps the
      drones out of the hive. Now in a democracy, too, there are drones, but
      they are more numerous and more dangerous than in the oligarchy; there
      they are inert and unpractised, here they are full of life and animation;
      and the keener sort speak and act, while the others buzz about the bema
      and prevent their opponents from being heard. And there is another class
      in democratic States, <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxiv"></a>cxxiv</span> of respectable, thriving individuals, who can be
      squeezed when the drones have need of their possessions; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage565A" class="pginternal">565</a></span>there is moreover
      a third class, who are the labourers and the artisans, and they make up
      the mass of the people. When the people meet, they are omnipotent, but
      they cannot be brought together unless they are attracted by a little
      honey; and the rich are made to supply the honey, of which the demagogues
      keep the greater part themselves, giving a taste only to the mob. Their
      victims attempt to resist; they are driven mad by the stings of the
      drones, and so become downright oligarchs in self-defence. Then follow
      informations and convictions for treason. The people have some protector
      whom they nurse into greatness, and from this root the tree of tyranny
      springs. The nature of the change is indicated in the old fable of the
      temple of Zeus Lycaeus, which tells how he who tastes human flesh mixed up
      with the flesh of other victims will turn into a wolf. Even so the
      protector, who tastes human blood, and slays some and exiles others with
      or without law, who hints at abolition of debts and division of lands,
      <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage566A" class="pginternal">566</a></span>must either perish or become a wolf—that is, a tyrant. Perhaps he is
      driven out, but he soon comes back from exile; and then if his enemies
      cannot get rid of him by lawful means, they plot his assassination.
      Thereupon the friend of the people makes his well-known request to them
      for a body-guard, which they readily grant, thinking only of his danger
      and not of their own. Now let the rich man make to himself wings, for he
      will never run away again if he does not do so then. And the Great
      Protector, having crushed all his rivals, stands proudly erect in the
      chariot of State, a full-blown tyrant: Let us enquire into the nature of
      his happiness.
    </p>
<p>
      In the early days of his tyranny he smiles and beams upon everybody; he is
      not a ‘dominus,’ no, not he: he has only come to put an end to debt and
      the monopoly of land. Having got rid of foreign enemies, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage567A" class="pginternal">567</a></span>he makes himself
      necessary to the State by always going to war. He is thus enabled to
      depress the poor by heavy taxes, and so keep them at work; and he can get
      rid of bolder spirits by handing them over to the enemy. Then comes
      unpopularity; some of his old associates have the courage to oppose him.
      The consequence is, that he has to make a purgation of the State; but,
      unlike the physician who purges <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxv"></a>cxxv</span> away the bad, he must get rid of the
      high-spirited, the wise and the wealthy; for he has no choice between
      death and a life of shame and dishonour. And the more hated he is, the
      more he will require trusty guards; but how will he obtain them? ‘They
      will come flocking like birds—for pay.’ Will he not rather obtain
      them on the spot? He will take the slaves from their owners and make them
      his body-guard; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage568A" class="pginternal">568</a></span>these are his trusted friends, who admire and look up to
      him. Are not the tragic poets wise who magnify and exalt the tyrant, and
      say that he is wise by association with the wise? And are not their
      praises of tyranny alone a sufficient reason why we should exclude them
      from our State? They may go to other cities, and gather the mob about them
      with fine words, and change commonwealths into tyrannies and democracies,
      receiving honours and rewards for their services; but the higher they and
      their friends ascend constitution hill, the more their honour will fail
      and become ‘too asthmatic to mount.’ To return to the tyrant—How
      will he support that rare army of his? First, by robbing the temples of
      their treasures, which will enable him to lighten the taxes; then he will
      take all his father’s property, and spend it on his companions, male or
      female. Now his father is the demus, and if the demus gets angry, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage569A" class="pginternal">569</a></span>and says
      that a great hulking son ought not to be a burden on his parents, and bids
      him and his riotous crew begone, then will the parent know what a monster
      he has been nurturing, and that the son whom he would fain expel is too
      strong for him. ‘You do not mean to say that he will beat his father?’
      Yes, he will, after having taken away his arms. ‘Then he is a parricide
      and a cruel, unnatural son.’ And the people have jumped from the fear of
      slavery into slavery, out of the smoke into the fire. Thus liberty, when
      out of all order and reason, passes into the worst form of servitude….

      In the previous books Plato has described the ideal State; now he returns
      to the perverted or declining forms, on which he had lightly touched at
      the end of Book iv. These he describes in a succession of parallels
      between the individuals and the States, tracing the origin of either in
      the State or individual which has preceded them. He begins by asking the
      point at which he digressed; and is thus led shortly to recapitulate the
      substance <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxvi"></a>cxxvi</span> of the three former books, which also contain a parallel of the
      philosopher and the State.

<p>
      Of the first decline he gives no intelligible account; he would not have
      liked to admit the most probable causes of the fall of his ideal State,
      which to us would appear to be the impracticability of communism or the
      natural antagonism of the ruling and subject classes. He throws a veil of
      mystery over the origin of the decline, which he attributes to ignorance
      of the law of population. Of this law the famous geometrical figure or
      number is the expression. Like the ancients in general, he had no idea of
      the gradual perfectibility of man or of the education of the human race.
      His ideal was not to be attained in the course of ages, but was to spring
      in full armour from the head of the legislator. When good laws had been
      given, he thought only of the manner in which they were likely to be
      corrupted, or of how they might be filled up in detail or restored in
      accordance with their original spirit. He appears not to have reflected
      upon the full meaning of his own words, ‘In the brief space of human life,
      nothing great can be accomplished’ (x. <a href="#stpage608B" class="pginternal">608 B</a>); or again, as he afterwards says in the
      Laws (iii. 676), ‘Infinite time is the maker of cities.’ The order of constitutions
      which is adopted by him represents an order of thought rather than a
      succession of time, and may be considered as the first attempt to frame a
      philosophy of history.
    </p>
<p>
      The first of these declining States is timocracy, or the government of
      soldiers and lovers of honour, which answers to the Spartan State; this is
      a government of force, in which education is not inspired by the Muses,
      but imposed by the law, and in which all the finer elements of
      organization have disappeared. The philosopher himself has lost the love
      of truth, and the soldier, who is of a simpler and honester nature, rules
      in his stead. The individual who answers to timocracy has some noticeable
      qualities. He is described as ill educated, but, like the Spartan, a lover
      of literature; and although he is a harsh master to his servants he has no
      natural superiority over them. His character is based upon a reaction
      against the circumstances of his father, who in a troubled city has
      retired from politics; and his mother, who is dissatisfied at her own
      position, is always urging him towards the life of political ambition.
      Such a character may have had this origin, and indeed Livy attributes the
      Licinian laws to a <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxvii"></a>cxxvii</span> feminine jealousy of a similar kind (vii. 34). But there is
      obviously no connection between the manner in which the timocratic State
      springs out of the ideal, and the mere accident by which the timocratic
      man is the son of a retired statesman.
    </p>
<p>
      The two next stages in the decline of constitutions have even less
      historical foundation. For there is no trace in Greek history of a polity
      like the Spartan or Cretan passing into an oligarchy of wealth, or of the
      oligarchy of wealth passing into a democracy. The order of history appears
      to be different; first, in the Homeric times there is the royal or
      patriarchal form of government, which a century or two later was succeeded
      by an oligarchy of birth rather than of wealth, and in which wealth was
      only the accident of the hereditary possession of land and power.
      Sometimes this oligarchical government gave way to a government based upon
      a qualification of property, which, according to Aristotle’s mode of using
      words, would have been called a timocracy; and this in some cities, as at
      Athens, became the conducting medium to democracy. But such was not the
      necessary order of succession in States; nor, indeed, can any order be
      discerned in the endless fluctuation of Greek history (like the tides in
      the Euripus), except, perhaps, in the almost uniform tendency from
      monarchy to aristocracy in the earliest times. At first sight there
      appears to be a similar inversion in the last step of the Platonic
      succession; for tyranny, instead of being the natural end of democracy, in
      early Greek history appears rather as a stage leading to democracy; the
      reign of Peisistratus and his sons is an episode which comes between the
      legislation of Solon and the constitution of Cleisthenes; and some secret
      cause common to them all seems to have led the greater part of Hellas at
      her first appearance in the dawn of history, e.g. Athens, Argos, Corinth,
      Sicyon, and nearly every State with the exception of Sparta, through a
      similar stage of tyranny which ended either in oligarchy or democracy. But
      then we must remember that Plato is describing rather the contemporary
      governments of the Sicilian States, which alternated between democracy and
      tyranny, than the ancient history of Athens or Corinth.
    </p>
<p>
      The portrait of the tyrant himself is just such as the later Greek
      delighted to draw of Phalaris and Dionysius, in which, as in the lives of
      mediaeval saints or mythic heroes, the conduct and actions <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxviii"></a>cxxviii</span> of one were
      attributed to another in order to fill up the outline. There was no
      enormity which the Greek was not today to believe of them; the tyrant was
      the negation of government and law; his assassination was glorious; there
      was no crime, however unnatural, which might not with probability be
      attributed to him. In this, Plato was only following the common thought of
      his countrymen, which he embellished and exaggerated with all the power of
      his genius. There is no need to suppose that he drew from life; or that
      his knowledge of tyrants is derived from a personal acquaintance with
      Dionysius. The manner in which he speaks of them would rather tend to
      render doubtful his ever having ‘consorted’ with them, or entertained the
      schemes, which are attributed to him in the Epistles, of regenerating
      Sicily by their help.
    </p>
<p>
      Plato in a hyperbolical and serio-comic vein exaggerates the follies of
      democracy which he also sees reflected in social life. To him democracy is
      a state of individualism or dissolution; in which every one is doing what
      is right in his own eyes. Of a people animated by a common spirit of
      liberty, rising as one man to repel the Persian host, which is the leading
      idea of democracy in Herodotus and Thucydides, he never seems to think.
      But if he is not a believer in liberty, still less is he a lover of
      tyranny. His deeper and more serious condemnation is reserved for the
      tyrant, who is the ideal of wickedness and also of weakness, and who in
      his utter helplessness and suspiciousness is leading an almost impossible
      existence, without that remnant of good which, in Plato’s opinion, was
      required to give power to evil (Book i. <a href="#stpage352B" class="pginternal">p. 352</a>). This ideal of wickedness living
      in helpless misery, is the reverse of that other portrait of perfect
      injustice ruling in happiness and splendour, which first of all
      Thrasymachus, and afterwards the sons of Ariston had drawn, and is also
      the reverse of the king whose rule of life is the good of his subjects.
    </p>
<p>
      Each of these governments and individuals has a corresponding ethical
      gradation: the ideal State is under the rule of reason, not extinguishing
      but harmonizing the passions, and training them in virtue; in the
      timocracy and the timocratic man the constitution, whether of the State or
      of the individual, is based, first, upon courage, and secondly, upon the
      love of honour; this latter virtue, <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxix"></a>cxxix</span> which is hardly to be esteemed a
      virtue, has superseded all the rest. In the second stage of decline the
      virtues have altogether disappeared, and the love of gain has succeeded to
      them; in the third stage, or democracy, the various passions are allowed
      to have free play, and the virtues and vices are impartially cultivated.
      But this freedom, which leads to many curious extravagances of character,
      is in reality only a state of weakness and dissipation. At last, one
      monster passion takes possession of the whole nature of man—this is
      tyranny. In all of them excess—the excess first of wealth and then
      of freedom, is the element of decay.
    </p>
<p>
      The eighth book of the Republic abounds in pictures of life and fanciful
      allusions; the use of metaphorical language is carried to a greater extent
      than anywhere else in Plato. We may remark,
         (1), the description of the two nations in one, which become more and more
      divided in the Greek Republics, as in feudal times, and perhaps also in
      our own;
         (2), the notion of democracy expressed in a sort of Pythagorean formula as
      equality among unequals;
         (3), the free and easy ways of men and animals, which are characteristic
      of liberty, as foreign mercenaries and universal mistrust are of the
      tyrant;
          (4), the proposal that mere debts should not be recoverable by law is a
      speculation which has often been entertained by reformers of the law in
      modern times, and is in harmony with the tendencies of modern legislation.
      Debt and land were the two great difficulties of the ancient lawgiver: in
      modern times we may be said to have almost, if not quite, solved the first
      of these difficulties, but hardly the second.
    </p>
<p>
      Still more remarkable are the corresponding portraits of individuals:
      there is the family picture of the father and mother and the old servant
      of the timocratical man, and the outward respectability and inherent
      meanness of the oligarchical; the uncontrolled licence and freedom of the
      democrat, in which the young Alcibiades seems to be depicted, doing right
      or wrong as he pleases, and who at last, like the prodigal, goes into a
      far country (note here the play of language by which the democratic man is
      himself represented under the image of a State having a citadel and
      receiving embassies); and there is the wild-beast nature, which breaks
      loose in his successor. The hit about the tyrant being a parricide; the
      representation of the tyrant’s life as <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxx"></a>cxxx</span> an obscene dream; the rhetorical
      surprise of a more miserable than the most miserable of men in Book ix;
      the hint to the poets that if they are the friends of tyrants there is no
      place for them in a constitutional State, and that they are too clever not
      to see the propriety of their own expulsion; the continuous image of the
      drones who are of two kinds, swelling at last into the monster drone
      having wings (see infra, <a href="#stpage573A" class="pginternal">Book ix</a>),—are among Plato’s happiest touches.
    </p>
<p>
      There remains to be considered the great difficulty of this book of the
      Republic, the so-called number of the State. This is a puzzle almost as
      great as the Number of the Beast in the Book of Revelation, and though
      apparently known to Aristotle, is referred to by Cicero as a proverb of
      obscurity (Ep. ad Att. vii. 13, 5). And some have imagined that there is no answer to
      the puzzle, and that Plato has been practising upon his readers. But such
      a deception as this is inconsistent with the manner in which Aristotle
      speaks of the number (Pol. v. 12, § 7), and would have been ridiculous to any reader
      of the Republic who was acquainted with Greek mathematics. As little
      reason is there for supposing that Plato intentionally used obscure
      expressions; the obscurity arises from our want of familiarity with the
      subject. On the other hand, Plato himself indicates that he is not
      altogether serious, and in describing his number as a solemn jest of the
      Muses, he appears to imply some degree of satire on the symbolical use of
      number. (Cp. Cratylus, <i>passim</i>; Protag. 342 ff.)

<p>
      Our hope of understanding the passage depends principally on an accurate
      study of the words themselves; on which a faint light is thrown by the
      parallel passage in the ninth book. Another help is the allusion in
      Aristotle, who makes the important remark that the latter part of the
      passage (from <span class="transl" title="ô(=n e)pi/tritos puthmê\n, k.t.l.">ὧν ἐπίτριτος πυθμὴν, κ.τ.λ.</span>) describes a solid figure.<a href="#Footnoteintro2" id="FnAnchorintro2" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">2</span></a>  Some further clue
      may be gathered from the appearance of the Pythagorean triangle, which is
      denoted by the numbers 3, 4, 5, and in which, as in every right-angled
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxxi"></a>cxxxi</span> triangle, the squares of the two lesser sides equal the square of the
      hypotenuse (3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> = 5<sup>2</sup>, or 9 + 16 = 25).
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnoteintro2"></a><a href="#FnAnchorintro2" class="pginternal">2</a></span> Pol. v. 12, § 8:—‘He only says that
      nothing is abiding, but that all things change in a certain cycle; and
      that the origin of the change is a base of numbers which are in the ratio
      of 4 : 3; and this when combined with a figure of five gives two harmonies;
      he means when the number of this figure becomes solid.’</p></div>
<p>
      Plato begins by speaking of a perfect or cyclical number (cp. Tim. 39 D), i.e. a
      number in which the sum of the divisors equals the whole; this is the
      divine or perfect number in which all lesser cycles or revolutions are
      complete. He also speaks of a human or imperfect number, having four terms
      and three intervals of numbers which are related to one another in certain
      proportions; these he converts into figures, and finds in them when they
      have been raised to the third power certain elements of number, which give
      two ‘harmonies,’ the one square, the other oblong; but he does not say
      that the square number answers to the divine, or the oblong number to the
      human cycle; nor is any intimation given that the first or divine number
      represents the period of the world, the second the period of the state, or
      of the human race as Zeller supposes; nor is the divine number afterwards
      mentioned (cp. Arist.). The second is the number of generations or births, and
      presides over them in the same mysterious manner in which the stars
      preside over them, or in which, according to the Pythagoreans,
      opportunity, justice, marriage, are represented by some number or figure.
      This is probably the number 216.
    </p>
<p>
      The explanation given in the text supposes the two harmonies to make up
      the number 8000. This explanation derives a certain plausibility from the
      circumstance that 8000 is the ancient number of the Spartan citizens
      (Herod. vii. 34), and would be what Plato might have called ‘a number which nearly
      concerns the population of a city’ (<a href="#stpage588A" class="pginternal">588 A</a>); the mysterious disappearance of the
      Spartan population may possibly have suggested to him the first cause of
      his decline of States. The lesser or square ‘harmony,’ of 400, might be a
      symbol of the guardians,—the larger or oblong ‘harmony,’ of the
      people, and the numbers 3, 4, 5 might refer respectively to the three
      orders in the State or parts of the soul, the four virtues, the five forms
      of government. The harmony of the musical scale, which is elsewhere used
      as a symbol of the harmony of the state (Rep. iv. <a href="#stpage443D" class="pginternal">443 D</a>), is also indicated. For the
      numbers 3, 4, 5, which represent the sides of the Pythagorean triangle,
      also denote the intervals of the scale.
    </p>
<p>
      The terms used in the statement of the problem may be <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxxii"></a>cxxxii</span> explained as
      follows. A perfect number (<span class="transl" title="te/leios a)rithmo/s">τέλειος ἀριθμός</span>), as already stated, is one which is
      equal to the sum of its divisors. Thus 6, which is the first perfect or
      cyclical number, = 1 + 2 + 3. The words <span class="transl" title="o)/roi">ὄροι</span>, ‘terms’ or ‘notes,’ and
     <span class="transl" title="a)posta/seis">ἀποστάσεις</span>, ‘intervals,’ are applicable to music as well as to number and
      figure. <span class="transl" title="Prô/tô|">Πρώτῳ</span> is the ‘base’ on which the whole calculation depends, or
      the ‘lowest term’ from which it can be worked out. The words <span class="transl" title="duna/menai/ te kai\ dunasteuo/menoi">δυνάμεναί τε καὶ δυναστευόμενοι</span> have
      been variously translated—‘squared and cubed’ (Donaldson),
      ‘equalling and equalled in power’ (Weber), ‘by involution and evolution,’
      i.e. by raising the power and extracting the root (as in the translation).
      Numbers are called ‘like and unlike’ (<span class="transl" title="o(moiou=nte/s te kai\ a)nomoiou=ntes">ὁμοιοῦντές τε καὶ ἀνομοιοῦντες</span>) when the factors or the sides
      of the planes and cubes which they represent are or are not in the same
      ratio: e.g. 8 and 27 = 2<sup>3</sup> and 3<sup>3</sup>; and conversely. ‘Waxing’
      (<span class="transl" title="au)/xontes">αὔξοντες</span>) numbers, called also ‘increasing’ (<span class="transl" title="u(pertelei=s">ὑπερτελεῖς</span>), are those which are
      exceeded by the sum of their divisors: e.g. 12 and 18 are less than 16 and
      21. ‘Waning’ (<span class="transl" title="phthi/nontes">φθίνοντες</span>) numbers, called also ‘decreasing’ (<span class="transl" title=" e)llipei=s">ἐλλιπεῖς</span>) are those
      which succeed the sum of their divisors: e.g. 8 and 27 exceed 7 and 13.
      The words translated ‘commensurable and agreeable to one another’ (<span class="transl" title="prosê/gora kai\ r(êta/">προσήγορα καὶ ῥητά</span>)
      seem to be different ways of describing the same relation, with more or
      less precision. They are equivalent to ‘expressible in terms having the
      same relation to one another,’ like the series 8, 12, 18, 27, each of
      which numbers is in the relation of 1<span class="smcap"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span> to the preceding. The
      ‘base,’ or ‘fundamental number, which has <span class="smcap"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub></span> added to it’ (1<span class="smcap"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub></span>) =
      <span class="smcap"><sup>4</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub></span> or a musical fourth. <span class="transl" title="A(rmoni/a">Ἁρμονία</span> is a ‘proportion’ of numbers as of
      musical notes, applied either to the parts or factors of a single number
      or to the relation of one number to another. The first harmony is a
      ‘square’ number (<span class="transl" title="i)/sên i)sa/kis">ἴσην ἰσάκις</span>); the second harmony is an ‘oblong’ number (<span class="transl" title="promê/kê">προμήκη</span>),
      i.e. a number representing a figure of which the opposite sides only are
      equal. <span class="transl" title="A)rithmoi\ a)po\ diame/trôn">Ἀριθμοὶ ἀπὸ διαμέτρων</span> = ‘numbers squared from’ or ‘upon diameters’; <span class="transl" title="r(êtô=n">ῥητῶν</span> =
      ‘rational,’ i.e. omitting fractions, <span class="transl" title="a)r)r(ê/tôn">ἀῤῥήτων</span>, ‘irrational,’ i.e. including
      fractions; e.g. 49 is a square of the rational diameter of a figure the
      side of which = 5: 50, of an irrational diameter of the same. For several
      of the explanations here given and for a good deal besides I am indebted
      to an excellent article on the Platonic Number by Dr. Donaldson (Proc. of
      the Philol. Society, vol. i. p. 81 ff.).
    </p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxxiii"></a>cxxxiii</span> The conclusions which he draws from these data are summed up by him as
      follows. Having assumed that the number of the perfect or divine cycle is
      the number of the world, and the number of the imperfect cycle the number
      of the state, he proceeds: ‘The period of the world is defined by the
      perfect number 6, that of the state by the cube of that number or 216,
      which is the product of the last pair of terms in the Platonic Tetractys<a href="#Footnoteintro3" id="FnAnchorintro3" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">3</span></a>; and if we take this as
      the basis of our computation, we shall have two cube numbers (<span class="transl" title="au)xê/seis duna/menai/ te kai\ dunasteuo/menai">αὐξήσεις δυνάμεναί τε καὶ δυναστευόμεναι</span>), viz.
      8 and 27; and the mean proportionals between these, viz. 12 and 18, will
      furnish three intervals and four terms, and these terms and intervals
      stand related to one another in the <i>sesqui-altera</i> ratio, i.e. each term is
      to the preceding as <span class="smcap"><sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>. Now if we remember that the number 216 = 8 ×  27 = 3<sup>3</sup> + 4<sup>3</sup> + 5<sup>3</sup>, and 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> = 5<sup>2</sup>, we
      must admit that this number implies the numbers 3, 4, 5, to which
      musicians attach so much importance. And if we combine the ratio <span class="smcap"><sup>4</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub></span> with
      the number 5, or multiply the ratios of the sides by the hypotenuse, we
      shall by first squaring and then cubing obtain two expressions, which
      denote the ratio of the two last pairs of terms in the Platonic Tetractys,
      the former multiplied by the square, the latter by the cube of the number
      10, the sum of the first four digits which constitute the Platonic
      Tetractys.’ The two <span class="transl" title="a(rmoni/ai">ἁρμονίαι</span> he elsewhere explains as follows: ‘The first
      <span class="transl" title="a(rmoni/a">ἁρμονία</span> is
<span class="transl" title="i)/sên i)sa/kis e(kato\n tosauta/kis">ἴσην ἰσάκις ἑκατὸν τοσαυτάκις</span>, in other words (<span class="smcap"><sup>4</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub></span> ×  5)<sup>2</sup> = 100 × <span class="smcap"><sup>2<sup>2</sup></sup>⁄<sub>3<sup>2</sup></sub></span>. The second <span class="transl" title="a(rmoni/a">ἁρμονία</span>, a cube of the same root, is described
      as 100 multiplied (<span class="transl" title="a">α</span>) by the rational diameter of 5 diminished by
      unity, i.e., as shown above, 48: (<span class="transl" title="b">β</span>) by two incommensurable diameters,
      i.e. the two first irrationals, or 2 and 3: and (<span class="transl" title="g">γ</span>) by the cube of 3,
      or 27. Thus we have (48 + 5 + 27) 100 = 1000 ×  2<sup>3</sup>. This second
      harmony is to be the cube of the number of which the former harmony is the
      square, and therefore must be divided by the cube of 3. In other words,
      the whole expression will be: (1), for the first harmony, <span class="smcap"><sup>400</sup>⁄<sub>9</sub></span>: (2), for
      the second harmony, <span class="smcap"><sup>8000</sup>⁄<sub>27</sub></span>.’
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnoteintro3"></a><a href="#FnAnchorintro3" class="pginternal">3</a></span> The Platonic Tetractys consisted of a series of seven terms,
1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27.</p></div>
<p>
      The reasons which have inclined me to agree with Dr. Donaldson and also
      with Schleiermacher in supposing that 216 is the Platonic number of births
      are: (1) that it coincides with the description of the number given in the
      first part of the passage (<span class="transl" title="e)n ô(=| prô/tô| ...  a)pe/phêsan">ἐν ᾧ πρώτῳ …  <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxxiv"></a>cxxxiv</span> ἀπέφησαν</span>): (2) that the number 216 with its
      permutations would have been familiar to a Greek mathematician, though
      unfamiliar to us: (3) that 216 is the cube of 6, and also the sum of 3<sup>3</sup>, 4<sup>3</sup>, 5<sup>3</sup>, the numbers 3, 4, 5 representing the Pythagorean
      triangle, of which the sides when squared equal the square of the
      hypotenuse (3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> = 5<sup>2</sup>): (4) that it is also the period of the
      Pythagorean Metempsychosis: (5) the three ultimate terms or bases (3, 4,
      5) of which 216 is composed answer to the third, fourth, fifth in the
      musical scale: (6) that the number 216 is the product of the cubes of 2
      and 3, which are the two last terms in the Platonic Tetractys: (7) that
      the Pythagorean triangle is said by Plutarch (de Is. et Osir., 373 E), Proclus (super prima Eucl. iv. p. 111), and Quintilian
(de Musica iii. p. 152) to be contained in this passage, so that the tradition
of the school seems to point in the same direction: (8) that the
Pythagorean triangle is called also the figure of marriage (<span class="transl" title="gamê/lion dia/gramma">γαμήλιον διάγραμμα</span>).
    </p>
<p>
      But though agreeing with Dr. Donaldson thus far, I see no reason for
      supposing, as he does, that the first or perfect number is the world, the
      human or imperfect number the state; nor has he given any proof that the
      second harmony is a cube. Nor do I think that <span class="transl" title="a)r)r(ê/tôn de\ duei=n">ἀῤῥήτων δὲ δυεῖν</span> can mean ‘two
      incommensurables,’ which he arbitrarily assumes to be 2 and 3, but rather,
      as the preceding clause implies, <span class="transl" title="duei=n a)rithmoi=n a)po\ a)r)r(ê/tôn diame/trôn pempa/dos">δυεῖν ἀριθμοῖν ἀπὸ ἀῤῥήτων διαμέτρων πεμπάδος</span>, i.e. two square numbers based
      upon irrational diameters of a figure the side of which is 5 = 50 ×  2.
    </p>
<p>
      The greatest objection to the translation is the sense given to the words
      <span class="transl" title="e)pi/tritos puthmê/n k.t.l.">ἐπίτριτος πυθμήν κ.τ.λ.</span>, ‘a base of three with a third added to it, multiplied by 5.’ In
      this somewhat forced manner Plato introduces once more the numbers of the
      Pythagorean triangle. But the coincidences in the numbers which follow are
      in favour of the explanation. The first harmony of 400, as has been
      already remarked, probably represents the rulers; the second and oblong
      harmony of 7600, the people.
    </p>
<p>
      And here we take leave of the difficulty. The discovery of the riddle
      would be useless, and would throw no light on ancient mathematics. The
      point of interest is that Plato should have used such a symbol, and that
      so much of the Pythagorean spirit should have prevailed in him. His
      general meaning is that divine creation is perfect, and is represented or
      presided <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxxv"></a>cxxxv</span> over by a perfect or cyclical number; human generation is
      imperfect, and represented or presided over by an imperfect number or
      series of numbers. The number 5040, which is the number of the citizens in
      the Laws, is expressly based by him on utilitarian grounds, namely, the
      convenience of the number for division; it is also made up of the first
      seven digits multiplied by one another. The contrast of the perfect and
      imperfect number may have been easily suggested by the corrections of the
      cycle, which were made first by Meton and secondly by Callippus; (the
      latter is said to have been a pupil of Plato). Of the degree of importance
      or of exactness to be attributed to the problem, the number of the tyrant
      in Book ix. (729 = 365 × 2), and the slight correction of the error in the
      number 5040÷12 (Laws, 771 C), may furnish a criterion. There is nothing
      surprising in the circumstance that those who were seeking for order in
      nature and had found order in number, should have imagined one to give law
      to the other. Plato believes in a power of number far beyond what he could
      see realized in the world around him, and he knows the great influence
      which ‘the little matter of 1, 2, 3’ (vii. <a href="#stpage522C" class="pginternal">522 C</a>) exercises upon education. He may even
      be thought to have a prophetic anticipation of the discoveries of Quetelet
      and others, that numbers depend upon numbers; e.g.—in population,
      the numbers of births and the respective numbers of children born of
      either sex, on the respective ages of parents, i.e. on other numbers.

<b>BOOK IX.</b> <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage571A" class="pginternal">571</a></span>Last of all comes the tyrannical man, about whom we have to
      enquire, Whence is he, and how does he live—in happiness or in
      misery? There is, however, a previous question of the nature and number of
      the appetites, which I should like to consider first. Some of them are
      unlawful, and yet admit of being chastened and weakened in various degrees
      by the power of reason and law. ‘What appetites do you mean?’ I mean those
      which are awake when the reasoning powers are asleep, which get up and
      walk about naked without any self-respect or shame; and there is no
      conceivable folly or crime, however cruel or unnatural, of which, in
      imagination, they may not be guilty. ‘True,’ he said; ‘very true.’ But
      when a man’s pulse beats temperately; and he has supped on a feast of
      reason and come to a knowledge of himself <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxxvi"></a>cxxxvi</span> before going to rest, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage572A" class="pginternal">572</a></span>and has
      satisfied his desires just enough to prevent their perturbing his reason,
      which remains clear and luminous, and when he is free from quarrel and
      heat,—the visions which he has on his bed are least irregular and
      abnormal. Even in good men there is such an irregular wild-beast nature,
      which peers out in sleep.
    </p>
<p>
      To return:—You remember what was said of the democrat; that he was
      the son of a miserly father, who encouraged the saving desires and
      repressed the ornamental and expensive ones; presently the youth got into
      fine company, and began to entertain a dislike to his father’s narrow
      ways; and being a better man than the corrupters of his youth, he came to
      a mean, and led a life, not of lawless or slavish passion, but of regular
      and successive indulgence. Now imagine that the youth has become a father,
      and has a son who is exposed to the same temptations, and has companions
      who lead him into every sort of iniquity, and parents and friends who try
      to keep him right. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage573A" class="pginternal">573</a></span>The counsellors of evil find that their only chance of
      retaining him is to implant in his soul a monster drone, or love; while
      other desires buzz around him and mystify him with sweet sounds and
      scents, this monster love takes possession of him, and puts an end to
      every true or modest thought or wish. Love, like drunkenness and madness,
      is a tyranny; and the tyrannical man, whether made by nature or habit, is
      just a drinking, lusting, furious sort of animal.
    </p>
<p>
      And how does such an one live? ‘Nay, that you must tell me.’ Well then, I
      fancy that he will live amid revelries and harlotries, and love will be
      the lord and master of the house. Many desires require much money, and so
      he spends all that he has and borrows more; and when he has nothing the
      young ravens are still in the nest in which they were hatched, crying for
      food. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage574A" class="pginternal">574</a></span>Love urges them on; and they must be gratified by force or fraud, or
      if not, they become painful and troublesome; and as the new pleasures
      succeed the old ones, so will the son take possession of the goods of his
      parents; if they show signs of refusing, he will defraud and deceive them;
      and if they openly resist, what then? ‘I can only say, that I should not
      much like to be in their place.’ But, O heavens, Adeimantus, to think that
      for some new-fangled and unnecessary love he will give up his old father
      and mother, best and dearest of friends, or enslave them to the fancies of
      the hour! <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxxvii"></a>cxxxvii</span> Truly a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and mother!
      When there is no more to be got out of them, he turns burglar or
      pickpocket, or robs a temple. Love overmasters the thoughts of his youth,
      and he becomes in sober reality the monster that he was sometimes in
      sleep. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage575A" class="pginternal">575</a></span>He waxes strong in all violence and lawlessness; and is ready for
      any deed of daring that will supply the wants of his rabble-rout. In a
      well-ordered State there are only a few such, and these in time of war go
      out and become the mercenaries of a tyrant. But in time of peace they stay
      at home and do mischief; they are the thieves, footpads, cut-purses,
      man-stealers of the community; or if they are able to speak, they turn
      false-witnesses and informers. ‘No small catalogue of crimes truly, even
      if the perpetrators are few.’ Yes, I said; but small and great are
      relative terms, and no crimes which are committed by them approach those
      of the tyrant, whom this class, growing strong and numerous, create out of
      themselves. If the people yield, well and good, but, if they resist, then,
      as before he beat his father and mother, so now he beats his fatherland
      and motherland, and places his mercenaries over them. Such men in their
      early days live with flatterers, and they themselves flatter others, in
      order to gain their ends; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage576A" class="pginternal">576</a></span>but they soon discard their followers when they
      have no longer any need of them; they are always either masters or
      servants,—the joys of friendship are unknown to them. And they are
      utterly treacherous and unjust, if the nature of justice be at all
      understood by us. They realize our dream; and he who is the most of a
      tyrant by nature, and leads the life of a tyrant for the longest time,
      will be the worst of them, and being the worst of them, will also be the
      most miserable.
    </p>
<p>
      Like man, like State,—the tyrannical man will answer to tyranny,
      which is the extreme opposite of the royal State; for one is the best and
      the other the worst. But which is the happier? Great and terrible as the
      tyrant may appear enthroned amid his satellites, let us not be afraid to
      go in and ask; and the answer is, that the monarchical is the happiest,
      and the tyrannical the most miserable of States. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage577A" class="pginternal">577</a></span>And may we not ask the
      same question about the men themselves, requesting some one to look into
      them who is able to penetrate the inner nature of man, and will not be
      panic-struck by the vain pomp of tyranny? I will suppose that he <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxxviii"></a>cxxxviii</span> is one
      who has lived with him, and has seen him in family life, or perhaps in the
      hour of trouble and danger.
    </p>
<p>
      Assuming that we ourselves are the impartial judge for whom we seek, let
      us begin by comparing the individual and State, and ask first of all,
      whether the State is likely to be free or enslaved—Will there not be
      a little freedom and a great deal of slavery? And the freedom is of the
      bad, and the slavery of the good; and this applies to the man as well as
      to the State; for his soul is full of meanness and slavery, and the better
      part is enslaved to the worse. He cannot do what he would, and his mind is
      full of confusion; he is the very reverse of a freeman. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage578A" class="pginternal">578</a></span>The State will be
      poor and full of misery and sorrow; and the man’s soul will also be poor
      and full of sorrows, and he will be the most miserable of men. No, not the
      most miserable, for there is yet a more miserable. ‘Who is that?’ The
      tyrannical man who has the misfortune also to become a public tyrant.
      ‘There I suspect that you are right.’ Say rather, ‘I am sure;’ conjecture
      is out of place in an enquiry of this nature. He is like a wealthy owner
      of slaves, only he has more of them than any private individual. You will
      say, ‘The owners of slaves are not generally in any fear of them.’ But
      why? Because the whole city is in a league which protects the individual.
      Suppose however that one of these owners and his household is carried off
      by a god into a wilderness, where there are no freemen to help him—will
      he not be in an agony of terror?—<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage579A" class="pginternal">579</a></span>will he not be compelled to flatter
      his slaves and to promise them many things sore against his will? And
      suppose the same god who carried him off were to surround him with
      neighbours who declare that no man ought to have slaves, and that the
      owners of them should be punished with death. ‘Still worse and worse! He
      will be in the midst of his enemies.’ And is not our tyrant such a captive
      soul, who is tormented by a swarm of passions which he cannot indulge;
      living indoors always like a woman, and jealous of those who can go out
      and see the world?
    </p>
<p>
      Having so many evils, will not the most miserable of men be still more
      miserable in a public station? Master of others when he is not master of
      himself; like a sick man who is compelled to be an athlete; the meanest of
      slaves and the most abject of flatterers; wanting all things, and never
      able to satisfy his desires; always in fear and distraction, like the
      State of which he is the representative. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage580A" class="pginternal">580</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxxxix"></a>cxxxix</span> His jealous, hateful, faithless
      temper grows worse with command; he is more and more faithless, envious,
      unrighteous,—the most wretched of men, a misery to himself and to
      others. And so let us have a final trial and proclamation; need we hire a
      herald, or shall I proclaim the result? ‘Make the proclamation yourself.’
      <em>The son of Ariston</em> (<em>the best</em>) <em>is of opinion that the best and justest of
      men is also the happiest, and that this is he who is the most royal master
      of himself; and that the unjust man is he who is the greatest tyrant of
      himself and of his State. And I add further—‘seen or unseen by gods
      or men.’</em>
</p>
<p>
      This is our first proof. The second is derived from the three kinds of
      pleasure, which answer to the three elements of the soul—reason,
      passion, desire; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage581A" class="pginternal">581</a></span>under which last is comprehended avarice as well as
      sensual appetite, while passion includes ambition, party-feeling, love of
      reputation. Reason, again, is solely directed to the attainment of truth,
      and careless of money and reputation. In accordance with the difference of
      men’s natures, one of these three principles is in the ascendant, and they
      have their several pleasures corresponding to them. Interrogate now the
      three natures, and each one will be found praising his own pleasures and
      depreciating those of others. The money-maker will contrast the vanity of
      knowledge with the solid advantages of wealth. The ambitious man will
      despise knowledge which brings no honour; whereas the philosopher will
      regard only the fruition of truth, and will call other pleasures necessary
      rather than good. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage582A" class="pginternal">582</a></span>Now, how shall we decide between them? Is there any
      better criterion than experience and knowledge? And which of the three has
      the truest knowledge and the widest experience? The experience of youth
      makes the philosopher acquainted with the two kinds of desire, but the
      avaricious and the ambitious man never taste the pleasures of truth and
      wisdom. Honour he has equally with them; they are ‘judged of him,’ but he
      is ‘not judged of them,’ for they never attain to the knowledge of true
      being. And his instrument is reason, whereas their standard is only wealth
      and honour; and if by reason we are to judge, his good will be the truest.
      And so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the rational part of
      the soul, and a life passed in such pleasure is the pleasantest. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage583A" class="pginternal">583</a></span>He who
      has a right to judge judges thus. Next comes the life of ambition, and, in
      the third place, that of money-making.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxl"></a>cxl</span> Twice has the just man overthrown the unjust—once more, as in an
      Olympian contest, first offering up a prayer to the saviour Zeus, let him
      try a fall. A wise man whispers to me that the pleasures of the wise are
      true and pure; all others are a shadow only. Let us examine this: Is not
      pleasure opposed to pain, and is there not a mean state which is neither?
      When a man is sick, nothing is more pleasant to him than health. But this
      he never found out while he was well. In pain he desires only to cease
      from pain; on the other hand, when he is in an ecstasy of pleasure, rest
      is painful to him. Thus rest or cessation is both pleasure and pain. But
      can that which is neither become both? Again, pleasure and pain are
      motions, and the absence of them is rest; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage584A" class="pginternal">584</a></span>but if so, how can the absence
      of either of them be the other? Thus we are led to infer that the
      contradiction is an appearance only, and witchery of the senses. And these
      are not the only pleasures, for there are others which have no preceding
      pains. Pure pleasure then is not the absence of pain, nor pure pain the
      absence of pleasure; although most of the pleasures which reach the mind
      through the body are reliefs of pain, and have not only their reactions
      when they depart, but their anticipations before they come. They can be
      best described in a simile. There is in nature an upper, lower, and middle
      region, and he who passes from the lower to the middle imagines that he is
      going up and is already in the upper world; and if he were taken back
      again would think, and truly think, that he was descending. All this
      arises out of his ignorance of the true upper, middle, and lower regions.
      And a like confusion happens with pleasure and pain, and with many other
      things. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage585A" class="pginternal">585</a></span>The man who compares grey with black, calls grey white; and the
      man who compares absence of pain with pain, calls the absence of pain
      pleasure. Again, hunger and thirst are inanitions of the body, ignorance
      and folly of the soul; and food is the satisfaction of the one, knowledge
      of the other. Now which is the purer satisfaction—that of eating and
      drinking, or that of knowledge? Consider the matter thus: The satisfaction
      of that which has more existence is truer than of that which has less. The
      invariable and immortal has a more real existence than the variable and
      mortal, and has a corresponding measure of knowledge and truth. The soul,
      again, has more existence and truth and knowledge than the body, and is
      therefore more really satisfied and has a more <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxli"></a>cxli</span> natural pleasure. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage586A" class="pginternal">586</a></span>Those who
      feast only on earthly food, are always going at random up to the middle
      and down again; but they never pass into the true upper world, or have a
      taste of true pleasure. They are like fatted beasts, full of gluttony and
      sensuality, and ready to kill one another by reason of their insatiable
      lust; for they are not filled with true being, and their vessel is leaky
      (cp. Gorgias, 243 A, foll.). Their pleasures are mere shadows of pleasure, mixed with pain,
      coloured and intensified by contrast, and therefore intensely desired; and
      men go fighting about them, as Stesichorus says that the Greeks fought
      about the shadow of Helen at Troy, because they know not the truth.
    </p>
<p>
      The same may be said of the passionate element:—the desires of the
      ambitious soul, as well as of the covetous, have an inferior satisfaction.
      Only when under the guidance of reason do either of the other principles
      do their own business <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage587A" class="pginternal">587</a></span>or attain the pleasure which is natural to them.
      When not attaining, they compel the other parts of the soul to pursue a
      shadow of pleasure which is not theirs. And the more distant they are from
      philosophy and reason, the more distant they will be from law and order,
      and the more illusive will be their pleasures. The desires of love and
      tyranny are the farthest from law, and those of the king are nearest to
      it. There is one genuine pleasure, and two spurious ones: the tyrant goes
      beyond even the latter; he has run away altogether from law and reason.
      Nor can the measure of his inferiority be told, except in a figure. The
      tyrant is the third removed from the oligarch, and has therefore, not a
      shadow of his pleasure, but the shadow of a shadow only. The oligarch,
      again, is thrice removed from the king, and thus we get the formula 3 × 3,
      which is the number of a surface, representing the shadow which is the
      tyrant’s pleasure, and if you like to cube this ‘number of the beast,’ you
      will find that the measure of the difference amounts to 729; the king is
      729 times more happy than the tyrant. And this extraordinary number is
      <em>nearly</em> equal to the number of days and nights in a year (365 × 2 = 730);
      and is therefore concerned with human life. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage588A" class="pginternal">588</a></span>This is the interval between a
      good and bad man in happiness only: what must be the difference between
      them in comeliness of life and virtue!
    </p>
<p>
      Perhaps you may remember some one saying at the beginning of our
      discussion that the unjust man was profited if he had the <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxlii"></a>cxlii</span> reputation of
      justice. Now that we know the nature of justice and injustice, let us make
      an image of the soul, which will personify his words. First of all,
      fashion a multitudinous beast, having a ring of heads of all manner of
      animals, tame and wild, and able to produce and change them at pleasure.
      Suppose now another form of a lion, and another of a man; the second
      smaller than the first, the third than the second; join them together and
      cover them with a human skin, in which they are completely concealed. When
      this has been done, let us tell the supporter of injustice <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage589A" class="pginternal">589</a></span>that he is
      feeding up the beasts and starving the man. The maintainer of justice, on
      the other hand, is trying to strengthen the man; he is nourishing the
      gentle principle within him, and making an alliance with the lion heart,
      in order that he may be able to keep down the many-headed hydra, and bring
      all into unity with each other and with themselves. Thus in every point of
      view, whether in relation to pleasure, honour, or advantage, the just man
      is right, and the unjust wrong.
    </p>
<p>
      But now, let us reason with the unjust, who is not intentionally in error.
      Is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man, or rather to
      the God in man; the ignoble, that which subjects the man to the beast? And
      if so, who would receive gold on condition that he was to degrade the
      noblest part of himself under the worst?—who would sell his son or
      daughter into the hands of brutal and evil men, for any amount of money?
      And will he sell his own fairer and diviner part without any compunction
      to the most godless and foul? <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage590A" class="pginternal">590</a></span>Would he not be worse than Eriphyle, who
      sold her husband’s life for a necklace? And intemperance is the letting
      loose of the multiform monster, and pride and sullenness are the growth
      and increase of the lion and serpent element, while luxury and effeminacy
      are caused by a too great relaxation of spirit. Flattery and meanness
      again arise when the spirited element is subjected to avarice, and the
      lion is habituated to become a monkey. The real disgrace of handicraft
      arts is, that those who are engaged in them have to flatter, instead of
      mastering their desires; therefore we say that they should be placed under
      the control of the better principle in another because they have none in
      themselves; not, as Thrasymachus imagined, to the injury of the subjects,
      but for <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxliii"></a>cxliii</span> their good. And our intention in educating the young, is to give
      them self-control; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage591A" class="pginternal">591</a></span>the law desires to nurse up in them a higher principle,
      and when they have acquired this, they may go their ways.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘What, then, shall a man profit, if he gain the whole world’ and become
      more and more wicked? Or what shall he profit by escaping discovery, if
      the concealment of evil prevents the cure? If he had been punished, the
      brute within him would have been silenced, and the gentler element
      liberated; and he would have united temperance, justice, and wisdom in his
      soul—a union better far than any combination of bodily gifts. The
      man of understanding will honour knowledge above all; in the next place he
      will keep under his body, not only for the sake of health and strength,
      but in order to attain the most perfect harmony of body and soul. In the
      acquisition of riches, too, he will aim at order and harmony; he will not
      desire to heap up wealth without measure, but he will fear that the
      increase of wealth will disturb the constitution of his own soul. For the
      same reason <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage592A" class="pginternal">592</a></span>he will only accept such honours as will make him a better
      man; any others he will decline. ‘In that case,’ said he, ‘he will never
      be a politician.’ Yes, but he will, in his own city; though probably not
      in his native country, unless by some divine accident. ‘You mean that he
      will be a citizen of the ideal city, which has no place upon earth.’ But
      in heaven, I replied, there is a pattern of such a city, and he who wishes
      may order his life after that image. Whether such a state is or ever will
      be matters not; he will act according to that pattern and no other….

<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic IX.</i><br>I<span class="smcap">NTRODUCTION.</span></span>
      The most noticeable points in the 9th Book of the Republic are:—(1)
      the account of pleasure; (2) the number of the interval which divides the
      king from the tyrant; (3) the pattern which is in heaven.
    </p>
<p>
      1. Plato’s account of pleasure is remarkable for moderation, and in this
      respect contrasts with the later Platonists and the views which are
      attributed to them by Aristotle. He is not, like the Cynics, opposed to
      all pleasure, but rather desires that the several parts of the soul shall
      have their natural satisfaction; he even agrees with the Epicureans in
      describing pleasure <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxliv"></a>cxliv</span> as something more than the absence of pain. This is
      proved by the circumstance that there are pleasures which have no
      antecedent pains (as he also remarks in the Philebus), such as the
      pleasures of smell, and also the pleasures of hope and anticipation. In
      the previous book (pp. <a href="#stpage558A" class="pginternal">558</a>, <a href="#stpage559A" class="pginternal">559</a>) he had made the distinction between necessary and
      unnecessary pleasure, which is repeated by Aristotle, and he now observes
      that there are a further class of ‘wild beast’ pleasures, corresponding to
      Aristotle’s <span class="transl" title="thêrio/tês">θηριότης</span>. He dwells upon the relative and unreal character of
      sensual pleasures and the illusion which arises out of the contrast of
      pleasure and pain, pointing out the superiority of the pleasures of
      reason, which are at rest, over the fleeting pleasures of sense and
      emotion. The pre-eminence of royal pleasure is shown by the fact that
      reason is able to form a judgment of the lower pleasures, while the two
      lower parts of the soul are incapable of judging the pleasures of reason.
      Thus, in his treatment of pleasure, as in many other subjects, the
      philosophy of Plato is ‘sawn up into quantities’ by Aristotle; the
      analysis which was originally made by him became in the next generation
      the foundation of further technical distinctions. Both in Plato and
      Aristotle we note the illusion under which the ancients fell of regarding
      the transience of pleasure as a proof of its unreality, and of confounding
      the permanence of the intellectual pleasures with the unchangeableness of
      the knowledge from which they are derived. Neither do we like to admit
      that the pleasures of knowledge, though more elevating, are not more
      lasting than other pleasures, and are almost equally dependent on the
      accidents of our bodily state (cp. Introduction to Philebus).
    </p>
<p>
      2. The number of the interval which separates the king from the tyrant,
      and royal from tyrannical pleasures, is 729, the cube of 9. Which Plato
      characteristically designates as a number concerned with human life,
      because <em>nearly</em> equivalent to the number of days and nights in the year. He
      is desirous of proclaiming that the interval between them is immeasurable,
      and invents a formula to give expression to his idea. Those who spoke of
      justice as a cube, of virtue as an art of measuring (Prot. 357 A), saw no
      inappropriateness in conceiving the soul under the figure of a line, or
      the pleasure of the tyrant as separated from the <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxlv"></a>cxlv</span> pleasure of the king by
      the numerical interval of 729. And in modern times we sometimes use
      metaphorically what Plato employed as a philosophical formula. ‘It is not
      easy to estimate the loss of the tyrant, except perhaps in this way,’ says
      Plato. So we might say, that although the life of a good man is not to be
      compared to that of a bad man, yet you may measure the difference between
      them by valuing one minute of the one at an hour of the other (‘One day in
      thy courts is better than a thousand’), or you might say that ‘there is an
      infinite difference.’ But this is not so much as saying, in homely phrase,
      ‘They are a thousand miles asunder.’ And accordingly Plato finds the
      natural vehicle of his thoughts in a progression of numbers; this
      arithmetical formula he draws out with the utmost seriousness, and both
      here and in the number of generation seems to find an additional proof of
      the truth of his speculation in forming the number into a geometrical
      figure; just as persons in our own day are apt to fancy that a statement
      is verified when it has been only thrown into an abstract form. In
      speaking of the number 729 as proper to human life, he probably intended
      to intimate that one year of the tyrannical = 12 hours of the royal life.
    </p>
<p>
      The simple observation that the comparison of two similar solids is
      effected by the comparison of the cubes of their sides, is the
      mathematical groundwork of this fanciful expression. There is some
      difficulty in explaining the steps by which the number 729 is obtained;
      the oligarch is removed in the third degree from the royal and
      aristocratical, and the tyrant in the third degree from the oligarchical;
      but we have to arrange the terms as the sides of a square and to count the
      oligarch twice over, thus reckoning them not as = 5 but as = 9. The square
      of 9 is passed lightly over as only a step towards the cube.
    </p>
<p>
      3. Towards the close of the Republic, Plato seems to be more and more
      convinced of the ideal character of his own speculations. At the end of
      the 9th Book the pattern which is in heaven takes the place of the city of
      philosophers on earth. The vision which has received form and substance at
      his hands, is now discovered to be at a distance. And yet this distant
      kingdom is also the rule of man’s life (Bk. vii. <a href="#stpage540E" class="pginternal">540 E</a>). (‘Say not lo! here, or lo! there,
      for the kingdom of God is within you.’) Thus a note is struck which
      prepares for the revelation of a future <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxlvi"></a>cxlvi</span> life in the following Book. But
      the future life is present still; the ideal of politics is to be realized
      in the individual.
    </p>

<p id="iaX"><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic X.</i><br>A<span class="smcap">NALYSIS.</span></span>
<b>BOOK X.</b> <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage595A" class="pginternal">595</a></span>Many things pleased me in the order of our State, but there was
      nothing which I liked better than the regulation about poetry. The
      division of the soul throws a new light on our exclusion of imitation. I
      do not mind telling you in confidence that all poetry is an outrage on the
      understanding, unless the hearers have that balm of knowledge which heals
      error. I have loved Homer ever since I was a boy, and even now he appears
      to me to be the great master of tragic poetry. But much as I love the man,
      I love truth more, and therefore I must speak out: and first of all, will
      you explain what is imitation, for really I do not understand? ‘How likely
      then that I should understand!’ <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage596A" class="pginternal">596</a></span>That might very well be, for the duller
      often sees better than the keener eye. ‘True, but in your presence I can
      hardly venture to say what I think.’ Then suppose that we begin in our old
      fashion, with the doctrine of universals. Let us assume the existence of
      beds and tables. There is one idea of a bed, or of a table, which the
      maker of each had in his mind when making them; he did not make the ideas
      of beds and tables, but he made beds and tables according to the ideas.
      And is there not a maker of the works of all workmen, who makes not only
      vessels but plants and animals, himself, the earth and heaven, and things
      in heaven and under the earth? He makes the Gods also. ‘He must be a
      wizard indeed!’ But do you not see that there is a sense in which you
      could do the same? You have only to take a mirror, and catch the
      reflection of the sun, and the earth, or anything else—there now you
      have made them. ‘Yes, but only in appearance.’ Exactly so; and the painter
      is such a creator as you are with the mirror, and he is even more unreal
      than the carpenter; although neither the carpenter <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage597A" class="pginternal">597</a></span>nor any other artist
      can be supposed to make the absolute bed. ‘Not if philosophers may be
      believed.’ Nor need we wonder that his bed has but an imperfect relation
      to the truth. Reflect:—Here are three beds; one in nature, which is
      made by God; another, which is made by the carpenter; and the third, by
      the painter. God only made one, nor could he have made more than one; for
      if there had been two, there <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxlvii"></a>cxlvii</span> would always have been a third—more
      absolute and abstract than either, under which they would have been
      included. We may therefore conceive God to be the natural maker of the
      bed, and in a lower sense the carpenter is also the maker; but the painter
      is rather the imitator of what the other two make; he has to do with a
      creation which is thrice removed from reality. And the tragic poet is an
      imitator, and, like every other imitator, is thrice removed from the king
      and from the truth. The painter imitates not the original bed, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage598A" class="pginternal">598</a></span>but the bed
      made by the carpenter. And this, without being really different, appears
      to be different, and has many points of view, of which only one is caught
      by the painter, who represents everything because he represents a piece of
      everything, and that piece an image. And he can paint any other artist,
      although he knows nothing of their arts; and this with sufficient skill to
      deceive children or simple people. Suppose now that somebody came to us
      and told us, how he had met a man who knew all that everybody knows, and
      better than anybody:—should we not infer him to be a simpleton who,
      having no discernment of truth and falsehood, had met with a wizard or
      enchanter, whom he fancied to be all-wise? And when we hear persons saying
      that Homer and the tragedians know all the arts and all the virtues, must
      we not infer that they are under a similar delusion? <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage599A" class="pginternal">599</a></span>they do not see that
      the poets are imitators, and that their creations are only imitations.
      ‘Very true.’ But if a person could create as well as imitate, he would
      rather leave some permanent work and not an imitation only; he would
      rather be the receiver than the giver of praise? ‘Yes, for then he would
      have more honour and advantage.’
    </p>
<p>
      Let us now interrogate Homer and the poets. Friend Homer, say I to him, I
      am not going to ask you about medicine, or any art to which your poems
      incidentally refer, but about their main subjects—war, military
      tactics, politics. If you are only twice and not thrice removed from the
      truth—not an imitator or an image-maker, please to inform us what
      good you have ever done to mankind? Is there any city which professes to
      have received laws from you, as Sicily and Italy have from Charondas,
      <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage600A" class="pginternal">600</a></span>Sparta from Lycurgus, Athens from Solon? Or was any war ever carried on by
      your counsels? or is any invention attributed to you, as there is to
      Thales and Anacharsis? Or is there any <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxlviii"></a>cxlviii</span> Homeric way of life, such as the
      Pythagorean was, in which you instructed men, and which is called after
      you? ‘No, indeed; and Creophylus [Flesh-child] was even more unfortunate
      in his breeding than he was in his name, if, as tradition says, Homer in
      his lifetime was allowed by him and his other friends to starve.’ Yes, but
      could this ever have happened if Homer had really been the educator of
      Hellas? Would he not have had many devoted followers? If Protagoras and
      Prodicus can persuade their contemporaries that no one can manage house or
      State without them, is it likely that Homer and Hesiod would have been
      allowed to go about as beggars—I mean if they had really been able
      to do the world any good?—would not men have compelled them to stay
      where they were, or have followed them about in order to get education?
      But they did not; and therefore we may infer that Homer and all the poets
      are only imitators, who do but imitate the appearances of things. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage601A" class="pginternal">601</a></span>For as a
      painter by a knowledge of figure and colour can paint a cobbler without
      any practice in cobbling, so the poet can delineate any art in the colours
      of language, and give harmony and rhythm to the cobbler and also to the
      general; and you know how mere narration, when deprived of the ornaments
      of metre, is like a face which has lost the beauty of youth and never had
      any other. Once more, the imitator has no knowledge of reality, but only
      of appearance. The painter paints, and the artificer makes a bridle and
      reins, but neither understands the use of them—the knowledge of this
      is confined to the horseman; and so of other things. Thus we have three
      arts: one of use, another of invention, a third of imitation; and the user
      furnishes the rule to the two others. The flute-player will know the good
      and bad flute, and the maker will put faith in him; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage602A" class="pginternal">602</a></span>but the imitator will
      neither know nor have faith—neither science nor true opinion can be
      ascribed to him. Imitation, then, is devoid of knowledge, being only a
      kind of play or sport, and the tragic and epic poets are imitators in the
      highest degree.
    </p>
<p>
      And now let us enquire, what is the faculty in man which answers to
      imitation. Allow me to explain my meaning: Objects are differently seen
      when in the water and when out of the water, when near and when at a
      distance; and the painter or juggler makes use of this variation to impose
      upon us. And <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxlix"></a>cxlix</span> the art of measuring and weighing and calculating comes in to
      save our bewildered minds from the power of appearance; for, as we were
      saying, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage603A" class="pginternal">603</a></span>two contrary opinions of the same about the same and at the same
      time, cannot both of them be true. But which of them is true is determined
      by the art of calculation; and this is allied to the better faculty in the
      soul, as the arts of imitation are to the worse. And the same holds of the
      ear as well as of the eye, of poetry as well as painting. The imitation is
      of actions voluntary or involuntary, in which there is an expectation of a
      good or bad result, and present experience of pleasure and pain. But is a
      man in harmony with himself when he is the subject of these conflicting
      influences? Is there not rather a contradiction in him? Let me further
      ask, whether <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage604A" class="pginternal">604</a></span>he is more likely to control sorrow when he is alone or when
      he is in company. ‘In the latter case.’ Feeling would lead him to indulge
      his sorrow, but reason and law control him and enjoin patience; since he
      cannot know whether his affliction is good or evil, and no human thing is
      of any great consequence, while sorrow is certainly a hindrance to good
      counsel. For when we stumble, we should not, like children, make an
      uproar; we should take the measures which reason prescribes, not raising a
      lament, but finding a cure. And the better part of us is ready to follow
      reason, while the irrational principle is full of sorrow and distraction
      at the recollection of our troubles. Unfortunately, however, this latter
      furnishes the chief materials of the imitative arts. Whereas reason is
      ever in repose and cannot easily be displayed, especially to a mixed
      multitude who have no experience of her. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage605A" class="pginternal">605</a></span>Thus the poet is like the painter
      in two ways: first he paints an inferior degree of truth, and secondly, he
      is concerned with an inferior part of the soul. He indulges the feelings,
      while he enfeebles the reason; and we refuse to allow him to have
      authority over the mind of man; for he has no measure of greater and less,
      and is a maker of images and very far gone from truth.
    </p>
<p>
      But we have not yet mentioned the heaviest count in the indictment—the
      power which poetry has of injuriously exciting the feelings. When we hear
      some passage in which a hero laments his sufferings at tedious length, you
      know that we sympathize with him and praise the poet; and yet in our own
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecl"></a>cl</span> sorrows such an exhibition of feeling is regarded as effeminate and
      unmanly (cp. Ion, 535 E). Now, ought a man to feel pleasure in seeing another do what
      he hates and abominates in himself? <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage606A" class="pginternal">606</a></span>Is he not giving way to a sentiment
      which in his own case he would control?—he is off his guard because
      the sorrow is another’s; and he thinks that he may indulge his feelings
      without disgrace, and will be the gainer by the pleasure. But the
      inevitable consequence is that he who begins by weeping at the sorrows of
      others, will end by weeping at his own. The same is true of comedy,—you
      may often laugh at buffoonery which you would be ashamed to utter, and the
      love of coarse merriment on the stage will at last turn you into a buffoon
      at home. Poetry feeds and waters the passions and desires; she lets them
      rule instead of ruling them. And therefore, when we hear the encomiasts of
      Homer affirming that he is the educator of Hellas, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage607A" class="pginternal">607</a></span>and that all life
      should be regulated by his precepts, we may allow the excellence of their
      intentions, and agree with them in thinking Homer a great poet and
      tragedian. But we shall continue to prohibit all poetry which goes beyond
      hymns to the Gods and praises of famous men. Not pleasure and pain, but
      law and reason shall rule in our State.
    </p>
<p>
      These are our grounds for expelling poetry; but lest she should charge us
      with discourtesy, let us also make an apology to her. We will remind her
      that there is an ancient quarrel between poetry and philosophy, of which
      there are many traces in the writings of the poets, such as the saying of
      ‘the she-dog, yelping at her mistress,’ and ‘the philosophers who are
      ready to circumvent Zeus,’ and ‘the philosophers who are paupers.’
      Nevertheless we bear her no ill-will, and will gladly allow her to return
      upon condition that she makes a defence of herself in verse; and her
      supporters who are not poets may speak in prose. We confess her charms;
      but if she cannot show that she is useful as well as delightful, like
      rational lovers, we must renounce our love, though endeared to us by early
      associations. Having come to years of discretion, we know that poetry is
      not truth, and that a man should be careful how he introduces her to that
      state or constitution which he himself is; for there is a mighty issue at
      stake—no less than the good or evil of a human soul. And it is not
      worth while to forsake justice and virtue <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecli"></a>cli</span> for the attractions of poetry,
      any more than for the sake of honour or wealth. ‘I agree with you.’
    </p>
<p>
      And yet the rewards of virtue are greater far than I have described. ‘And
      can we conceive things greater still?’ Not, perhaps, in this brief span of
      life: but should an immortal being care about anything short of eternity?
      ‘I do not understand what you mean?’ Do you not know that the soul is
      immortal? ‘Surely you are not prepared to prove that?’ Indeed I am. ‘Then
      let me hear this argument, of which you make so light.’
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage609A" class="pginternal">609</a></span>You would admit that everything has an element of good and of evil. In all
      things there is an inherent corruption; and if this cannot destroy them,
      nothing else will. The soul too has her own corrupting principles, which
      are injustice, intemperance, cowardice, and the like. But none of these
      destroy the soul in the same sense that disease destroys the body. The
      soul may be full of all iniquities, but is not, by reason of them, brought
      any nearer to death. Nothing which was not destroyed from within ever
      perished by external affection of evil. The body, which is one thing,
      <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage610A" class="pginternal">610</a></span>cannot be destroyed by food, which is another, unless the badness of the
      food is communicated to the body. Neither can the soul, which is one
      thing, be corrupted by the body, which is another, unless she herself is
      infected. And as no bodily evil can infect the soul, neither can any
      bodily evil, whether disease or violence, or any other destroy the soul,
      unless it can be shown to render her unholy and unjust. But no one will
      ever prove that the souls of men become more unjust when they die. If a
      person has the audacity to say the contrary, the answer is—Then why
      do criminals require the hand of the executioner, and not die of
      themselves? ‘Truly,’ he said, ‘injustice would not be very terrible if it
      brought a cessation of evil; but I rather believe that the injustice which
      murders others may tend to quicken and stimulate the life of the unjust.’
      You are quite right. If sin which is her own natural and inherent evil
      cannot destroy the soul, hardly will anything else destroy her. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage611A" class="pginternal">611</a></span>But the
      soul which cannot be destroyed either by internal or external evil must be
      immortal and everlasting. And if this be true, souls will always exist in
      the same number. They cannot diminish, because they cannot be destroyed;
      nor yet increase, for the increase of the immortal must come from
      something <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclii"></a>clii</span> mortal, and so all would end in immortality. Neither is the soul
      variable and diverse; for that which is immortal must be of the fairest
      and simplest composition. If we would conceive her truly, and so behold
      justice and injustice in their own nature, she must be viewed by the light
      of reason pure as at birth, or as she is reflected in philosophy when
      holding converse with the divine and immortal and eternal. In her present
      condition we see her only like the sea-god Glaucus, bruised and maimed in
      the sea which is the world, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage612A" class="pginternal">612</a></span>and covered with shells and stones which are
      incrusted upon her from the entertainments of earth.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus far, as the argument required, we have said nothing of the rewards
      and honours which the poets attribute to justice; we have contented
      ourselves with showing that justice in herself is best for the soul in
      herself, even if a man should put on a Gyges’ ring and have the helmet of
      Hades too. And now you shall repay me what you borrowed; and I will
      enumerate the rewards of justice in life and after death. I granted, for
      the sake of argument, as you will remember, that evil might perhaps escape
      the knowledge of Gods and men, although this was really impossible. And
      since I have shown that justice has reality, you must grant me also that
      she has the palm of appearance. In the first place, the just man is known
      to the Gods, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage613A" class="pginternal">613</a></span>and he is therefore the friend of the Gods, and he will
      receive at their hands every good, always excepting such evil as is the
      necessary consequence of former sins. All things end in good to him,
      either in life or after death, even what appears to be evil; for the Gods
      have a care of him who desires to be in their likeness. And what shall we
      say of men? Is not honesty the best policy? The clever rogue makes a great
      start at first, but breaks down before he reaches the goal, and slinks
      away in dishonour; whereas the true runner perseveres to the end, and
      receives the prize. And you must allow me to repeat all the blessings
      which you attributed to the fortunate unjust—they bear rule in the
      city, they marry and give in marriage to whom they will; and the evils
      which you attributed to the unfortunate just, do really fall in the end on
      the unjust, although, as you implied, their sufferings are better veiled
      in silence.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage614A" class="pginternal">614</a></span>But all the blessings of this present life are as nothing when <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecliii"></a>cliii</span> compared
      with those which await good men after death. ‘I should like to hear about
      them.’ Come, then, and I will tell you the story of Er, the son of
      Armenius, a valiant man. He was supposed to have died in battle, but ten
      days afterwards his body was found untouched by corruption and sent home
      for burial. On the twelfth day he was placed on the funeral pyre and there
      he came to life again, and told what he had seen in the world below. He
      said that his soul went with a great company to a place, in which there
      were two chasms near together in the earth beneath, and two corresponding
      chasms in the heaven above. And there were judges sitting in the
      intermediate space, bidding the just ascend by the heavenly way on the
      right hand, having the seal of their judgment set upon them before, while
      the unjust, having the seal behind, were bidden to descend by the way on
      the left hand. Him they told to look and listen, as he was to be their
      messenger to men from the world below. And he beheld and saw the souls
      departing after judgment at either chasm; some who came from earth, were
      worn and travel-stained; others, who came from heaven, were clean and
      bright. They seemed glad to meet and rest awhile in the meadow; here they
      discoursed with one another of what they had seen in the other world.
      <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage615A" class="pginternal">615</a></span> Those who came from earth wept at the remembrance of their sorrows, but
      the spirits from above spoke of glorious sights and heavenly bliss. He
      said that for every evil deed they were punished tenfold—now the
      journey was of a thousand years’ duration, because the life of man was
      reckoned as a hundred years—and the rewards of virtue were in the
      same proportion. He added something hardly worth repeating about infants
      dying almost as soon as they were born. Of parricides and other murderers
      he had tortures still more terrible to narrate. He was present when one of
      the spirits asked—Where is Ardiaeus the Great? (This Ardiaeus was a
      cruel tyrant, who had murdered his father, and his elder brother, a
      thousand years before.) Another spirit answered, ‘He comes not hither, and
      will never come. And I myself,’ he added, ‘actually saw this terrible
      sight. At the entrance of the chasm, as we were about to reascend,
      Ardiaeus appeared, and some other sinners—most of whom had been
      tyrants, but not all—and just as they fancied that they were
      returning to life, the chasm gave a roar, <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage616A" class="pginternal">616</a></span>and then wild, fiery-looking men
      who knew the <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecliv"></a>cliv</span> meaning of the sound, seized him and several others, and
      bound them hand and foot and threw them down, and dragged them along at
      the side of the road, lacerating them and carding them like wool, and
      explaining to the passers-by, that they were going to be cast into hell.’
      The greatest terror of the pilgrims ascending was lest they should hear
      the voice, and when there was silence one by one they passed up with joy.
      To these sufferings there were corresponding delights.
    </p>
<p>
      On the eighth day the souls of the pilgrims resumed their journey, and in
      four days came to a spot whence they looked down upon a line of light, in
      colour like a rainbow, only brighter and clearer. One day more brought
      them to the place, and they saw that this was the column of light which
      binds together the whole universe. The ends of the column were fastened to
      heaven, and from them hung the distaff of Necessity, on which all the
      heavenly bodies turned—the hook and spindle were of adamant, and the
      whorl of a mixed substance. The whorl was in form like a number of boxes
      fitting into one another with their edges turned upwards, making together
      a single whorl which was pierced by the spindle. The outermost had the rim
      broadest, and the inner whorls were smaller and smaller, and had their
      rims narrower. The largest (the fixed stars) was spangled—the
      seventh (the sun) was brightest—the eighth (the moon) shone by the
      light of the seventh—<span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage617A" class="pginternal">617</a></span>the second and fifth (Saturn and Mercury) were
      most like one another and yellower than the eighth—the third
      (Jupiter) had the whitest light—the fourth (Mars) was red—the
      sixth (Venus) was in whiteness second. The whole had one motion, but while
      this was revolving in one direction the seven inner circles were moving in
      the opposite, with various degrees of swiftness and slowness. The spindle
      turned on the knees of Necessity, and a Siren stood hymning upon each
      circle, while Lachesis, Clotho, and Atropos, the daughters of Necessity,
      sat on thrones at equal intervals, singing of past, present, and future,
      responsive to the music of the Sirens; Clotho from time to time guiding
      the outer circle with a touch of her right hand; Atropos with her left
      hand touching and guiding the inner circles; Lachesis in turn putting
      forth her hand from time to time to guide both of them. On their arrival
      the pilgrims went to Lachesis, and there was an interpreter who arranged
      them, and taking from her <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclv"></a>clv</span> knees lots, and samples of lives, got up into a
      pulpit and said: ‘Mortal souls, hear the words of Lachesis, the daughter
      of Necessity. A new period of mortal life has begun, and you may choose
      what divinity you please; the responsibility of choosing is with you—God
      is blameless.’ <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage618A" class="pginternal">618</a></span>After speaking thus, he cast the lots among them and each
      one took up the lot which fell near him. He then placed on the ground
      before them the samples of lives, many more than the souls present; and
      there were all sorts of lives, of men and of animals. There were tyrannies
      ending in misery and exile, and lives of men and women famous for their
      different qualities; and also mixed lives, made up of wealth and poverty,
      sickness and health. Here, Glaucon, is the great risk of human life, and
      therefore the whole of education should be directed to the acquisition of
      such a knowledge as will teach a man to refuse the evil and choose the
      good. He should know all the combinations which occur in life—of
      beauty with poverty or with wealth,—of knowledge with external
      goods,—and at last choose with reference to the nature of the soul,
      regarding that only as the better life which makes men better, and leaving
      the rest. And <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage619A" class="pginternal">619</a></span>a man must take with him an iron sense of truth and right
      into the world below, that there too he may remain undazzled by wealth or
      the allurements of evil, and be determined to avoid the extremes and
      choose the mean. For this, as the messenger reported the interpreter to
      have said, is the true happiness of man; and any one, as he proclaimed,
      may, if he choose with understanding, have a good lot, even though he come
      last. ‘Let not the first be careless in his choice, nor the last despair.’
      He spoke; and when he had spoken, he who had drawn the first lot chose a
      tyranny: he did not see that he was fated to devour his own children—and
      when he discovered his mistake, he wept and beat his breast, blaming
      chance and the Gods and anybody rather than himself. He was one of those
      who had come from heaven, and in his previous life had been a citizen of a
      well-ordered State, but he had only habit and no philosophy. Like many
      another, he made a bad choice, because he had no experience of life;
      whereas those who came from earth and had seen trouble were not in such a
      hurry to choose. But if a man had followed philosophy while upon earth,
      and had been moderately fortunate in his lot, he might not only be happy
      here, but his pilgrimage both from and <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclvi"></a>clvi</span> to this world would be smooth and
      heavenly. Nothing was more curious than the spectacle of the choice, at
      once sad and laughable and wonderful; most of the souls only seeking to
      avoid their own condition in a previous life. <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage620A" class="pginternal">620</a></span>He saw the soul of Orpheus
      changing into a swan because he would not be born of a woman; there was
      Thamyras becoming a nightingale; musical birds, like the swan, choosing to
      be men; the twentieth soul, which was that of Ajax, preferring the life of
      a lion to that of a man, in remembrance of the injustice which was done to
      him in the judgment of the arms; and Agamemnon, from a like enmity to
      human nature, passing into an eagle. About the middle was the soul of
      Atalanta choosing the honours of an athlete, and next to her Epeus taking
      the nature of a workwoman; among the last was Thersites, who was changing
      himself into a monkey. Thither, the last of all, came Odysseus, and sought
      the lot of a private man, which lay neglected and despised, and when he
      found it he went away rejoicing, and said that if he had been first
      instead of last, his choice would have been the same. Men, too, were seen
      passing into animals, and wild and tame animals changing into one another.
    </p>
<p>
      When all the souls had chosen they went to Lachesis, who sent with each of
      them their genius or attendant to fulfil their lot. He first of all
      brought them under the hand of Clotho, and drew them within the revolution
      of the spindle impelled by her hand; from her they were carried to
      Atropos, who made the threads irreversible; <span class="stpagenum"><a href="#stpage621A" class="pginternal">621</a></span>whence, without turning round,
      they passed beneath the throne of Necessity; and when they had all passed,
      they moved on in scorching heat to the plain of Forgetfulness and rested
      at evening by the river Unmindful, whose water could not be retained in
      any vessel; of this they had all to drink a certain quantity—some of
      them drank more than was required, and he who drank forgot all things. Er
      himself was prevented from drinking. When they had gone to rest, about the
      middle of the night there were thunderstorms and earthquakes, and suddenly
      they were all driven divers ways, shooting like stars to their birth.
      Concerning his return to the body, he only knew that awaking suddenly in
      the morning he found himself lying on the pyre.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus, Glaucon, the tale has been saved, and will be our salvation, if we
      believe that the soul is immortal, and hold fast to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclvii"></a>clvii</span> heavenly way of
      Justice and Knowledge. So shall we pass undefiled over the river of
      Forgetfulness, and be dear to ourselves and to the Gods, and have a crown
      of reward and happiness both in this world and also in the millennial
      pilgrimage of the other.

<p> </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"><i>Republic X.</i><br>I<span class="smcap">NTRODUCTION.</span></span>
      The Tenth Book of the Republic of Plato falls into two divisions: first,
      resuming an old thread which has been interrupted, Socrates assails the
      poets, who, now that the nature of the soul has been analyzed, are seen to
      be very far gone from the truth; and secondly, having shown the reality of
      the happiness of the just, he demands that appearance shall be restored to
      him, and then proceeds to prove the immortality of the soul. The argument,
      as in the Phaedo and Gorgias, is supplemented by the vision of a future
      life.
    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
      Why Plato, who was himself a poet, and whose dialogues are poems and
      dramas, should have been hostile to the poets as a class, and especially
      to the dramatic poets; why he should not have seen that truth may be
      embodied in verse as well as in prose, and that there are some indefinable
      lights and shadows of human life which can only be expressed in poetry—some
      elements of imagination which always entwine with reason; why he should
      have supposed epic verse to be inseparably associated with the impurities
      of the old Hellenic mythology; why he should try Homer and Hesiod by the
      unfair and prosaic test of utility,—are questions which have always
      been debated amongst students of Plato. Though unable to give a complete
      answer to them, we may show—first, that his views arose naturally
      out of the circumstances of his age; and secondly, we may elicit the truth
      as well as the error which is contained in them.
    </p>
<p>
      He is the enemy of the poets because poetry was declining in his own
      lifetime, and a theatrocracy, as he says in the Laws (iii. 701 A), had taken the place
      of an intellectual aristocracy. Euripides exhibited the last phase of the
      tragic drama, and in him Plato saw the friend and apologist of tyrants,
      and the Sophist of tragedy. The old comedy was almost extinct; the new had
      not yet arisen. Dramatic and lyric poetry, like every other branch of
      Greek literature, was falling under the power of rhetoric. There was no
      ‘second or third’ to Æschylus and <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclviii"></a>clviii</span> Sophocles in the generation which
      followed them. Aristophanes, in one of his later comedies (Frogs, 89 foll.), speaks
      of ‘thousands of tragedy-making prattlers,’ whose attempts at poetry he
      compares to the chirping of swallows; ‘their garrulity went far beyond
      Euripides,’—‘they appeared once upon the stage, and there was an end
      of them.’ To a man of genius who had a real appreciation of the godlike
      Æschylus and the noble and gentle Sophocles, though disagreeing with some
      parts of their ‘theology’ (Rep. ii. <a href="#stpage380A" class="pginternal">380</a>), these ‘minor poets’ must have been
      contemptible and intolerable. There is no feeling stronger in the
      dialogues of Plato than a sense of the decline and decay both in
      literature and in politics which marked his own age. Nor can he have been
      expected to look with favour on the licence of Aristophanes, now at the
      end of his career, who had begun by satirizing Socrates in the Clouds, and
      in a similar spirit forty years afterwards had satirized the founders of
      ideal commonwealths in his Eccleziazusae, or Female Parliament (cp. x. <a href="#stpage606C" class="pginternal">606 C</a>, and Laws ii. 658 ff.; 817).
    </p>
<p>
      There were other reasons for the antagonism of Plato to poetry. The
      profession of an actor was regarded by him as a degradation of human
      nature, for ‘one man in his life’ cannot ‘play many parts;’ the characters
      which the actor performs seem to destroy his own character, and to leave
      nothing which can be truly called himself. Neither can any man live his
      life and act it. The actor is the slave of his art, not the master of it.
      Taking this view Plato is more decided in his expulsion of the dramatic
      than of the epic poets, though he must have known that the Greek
      tragedians afforded noble lessons and examples of virtue and patriotism,
      to which nothing in Homer can be compared. But great dramatic or even
      great rhetorical power is hardly consistent with firmness or strength of
      mind, and dramatic talent is often incidentally associated with a weak or
      dissolute character.
    </p>
<p>
      In the Tenth Book Plato introduces a new series of objections. First, he
      says that the poet or painter is an imitator, and in the third degree
      removed from the truth. His creations are not tested by rule and measure;
      they are only appearances. In modern times we should say that art is not
      merely imitation, but rather the expression of the ideal in forms of
      sense. Even adopting the humble image of Plato, from which his argument
      derives a colour, we should maintain that the artist <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclix"></a>clix</span> may ennoble the bed
      which he paints by the folds of the drapery, or by the feeling of home
      which he introduces; and there have been modern painters who have imparted
      such an ideal interest to a blacksmith’s or a carpenter’s shop. The eye or
      mind which feels as well as sees can give dignity and pathos to a ruined
      mill, or a straw-built shed [Rembrandt], to the hull of a vessel ‘going to
      its last home’ [Turner]. Still more would this apply to the greatest works
      of art, which seem to be the visible embodiment of the divine. Had Plato
      been asked whether the Zeus or Athene of Pheidias was the imitation of an
      imitation only, would he not have been compelled to admit that something
      more was to be found in them than in the form of any mortal; and that the
      rule of proportion to which they conformed was ‘higher far than any
      geometry or arithmetic could express?’ (Statesman, 257 A.)
    </p>
<p>
      Again, Plato objects to the imitative arts that they express the emotional
      rather than the rational part of human nature. He does not admit
      Aristotle’s theory, that tragedy or other serious imitations are a
      purgation of the passions by pity and fear; to him they appear only to
      afford the opportunity of indulging them. Yet we must acknowledge that we
      may sometimes cure disordered emotions by giving expression to them; and
      that they often gain strength when pent up within our own breast. It is
      not every indulgence of the feelings which is to be condemned. For there
      may be a gratification of the higher as well as of the lower—thoughts
      which are too deep or too sad to be expressed by ourselves, may find an
      utterance in the words of poets. Every one would acknowledge that there
      have been times when they were consoled and elevated by beautiful music or
      by the sublimity of architecture or by the peacefulness of nature. Plato
      has himself admitted, in the earlier part of the Republic, that the arts
      might have the effect of harmonizing as well as of enervating the mind;
      but in the Tenth Book he regards them through a Stoic or Puritan medium.
      He asks only ‘What good have they done?’ and is not satisfied with the
      reply, that ‘They have given innocent pleasure to mankind.’
    </p>
<p>
      He tells us that he rejoices in the banishment of the poets, since he has
      found by the analysis of the soul that they are concerned with the
      inferior faculties. He means to say that <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclx"></a>clx</span> the higher faculties have to do
      with universals, the lower with particulars of sense. The poets are on a
      level with their own age, but not on a level with Socrates and Plato; and
      he was well aware that Homer and Hesiod could not be made a rule of life
      by any process of legitimate interpretation; his ironical use of them is
      in fact a denial of their authority; he saw, too, that the poets were not
      critics—as he says in the Apology, ‘Any one was a better interpreter
      of their writings than they were themselves’ (22 C). He himself ceased to be a
      poet when he became a disciple of Socrates; though, as he tells us of
      Solon, ‘he might have been one of the greatest of them, if he had not been
      deterred by other pursuits’ (Tim. 21 C) Thus from many points of view there is
      an antagonism between Plato and the poets, which was foreshadowed to him
      in the old quarrel between philosophy and poetry. The poets, as he says in
      the Protagoras (316 E), were the Sophists of their day; and his dislike of the one
      class is reflected on the other. He regards them both as the enemies of
      reasoning and abstraction, though in the case of Euripides more with
      reference to his immoral sentiments about tyrants and the like. For Plato
      is the prophet who ‘came into the world to convince men’—first of
      the fallibility of sense and opinion, and secondly of the reality of
      abstract ideas. Whatever strangeness there may be in modern times in
      opposing philosophy to poetry, which to us seem to have so many elements
      in common, the strangeness will disappear if we conceive of poetry as
      allied to sense, and of philosophy as equivalent to thought and
      abstraction. Unfortunately the very word ‘idea,’ which to Plato is
      expressive of the most real of all things, is associated in our minds with
      an element of subjectiveness and unreality. We may note also how he
      differs from Aristotle who declares poetry to be truer than history, for
      the opposite reason, because it is concerned with universals, not like
      history, with particulars (Poet. c. 9, 3).
    </p>
<p>
      The things which are seen are opposed in Scripture to the things which are
      unseen—they are equally opposed in Plato to universals and ideas. To
      him all particulars appear to be floating about in a world of sense; they
      have a taint of error or even of evil. There is no difficulty in seeing
      that this is an illusion; for there is no more error or variation in an
      individual man, horse, <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxi"></a>clxi</span> bed, etc., than in the class man, horse, bed, etc.;
      nor is the truth which is displayed in individual instances less certain
      than that which is conveyed through the medium of ideas. But Plato, who is
      deeply impressed with the real importance of universals as instruments of
      thought, attributes to them an essential truth which is imaginary and
      unreal; for universals may be often false and particulars true. Had he
      attained to any clear conception of the individual, which is the synthesis
      of the universal and the particular; or had he been able to distinguish
      between opinion and sensation, which the ambiguity of the words <span class="transl" title="do/xa, phai/nesthai, ei)ko\s">δόξα, φαίνεσθαι, εἰκὸς</span>
      and the like, tended to confuse, he would not have denied truth to the
      particulars of sense.
    </p>
<p>
      But the poets are also the representatives of falsehood and feigning in
      all departments of life and knowledge, like the sophists and rhetoricians
      of the Gorgias and Phaedrus; they are the false priests, false prophets,
      lying spirits, enchanters of the world. There is another count put into
      the indictment against them by Plato, that they are the friends of the
      tyrant, and bask in the sunshine of his patronage. Despotism in all ages
      has had an apparatus of false ideas and false teachers at its service—in
      the history of Modern Europe as well as of Greece and Rome. For no
      government of men depends solely upon force; without some corruption of
      literature and morals—some appeal to the imagination of the masses—some
      pretence to the favour of heaven—some element of good giving power
      to evil (cp. i. <a href="#stpage352A" class="pginternal">352</a>), tyranny, even for a short time, cannot be maintained. The Greek
      tyrants were not insensible to the importance of awakening in their cause
      a Pseudo-Hellenic feeling; they were proud of successes at the Olympic
      games; they were not devoid of the love of literature and art. Plato is
      thinking in the first instance of Greek poets who had graced the courts of
      Dionysius or Archelaus: and the old spirit of freedom is roused within him
      at their prostitution of the Tragic Muse in the praises of tyranny. But
      his prophetic eye extends beyond them to the false teachers of other ages
      who are the creatures of the government under which they live. He compares
      the corruption of his contemporaries with the idea of a perfect society,
      and gathers up into one mass of evil the evils and errors of mankind; to
      him they are personified in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxii"></a>clxii</span> rhetoricians, sophists, poets, rulers who
      deceive and govern the world.
    </p>
<p>
      A further objection which Plato makes to poetry and the imitative arts is
      that they excite the emotions. Here the modern reader will be disposed to
      introduce a distinction which appears to have escaped him. For the
      emotions are neither bad nor good in themselves, and are not most likely
      to be controlled by the attempt to eradicate them, but by the moderate
      indulgence of them. And the vocation of art is to present thought in the
      form of feeling, to enlist the feelings on the side of reason, to inspire
      even for a moment courage or resignation; perhaps to suggest a sense of
      infinity and eternity in a way which mere language is incapable of
      attaining. True, the same power which in the purer age of art embodies
      gods and heroes only, may be made to express the voluptuous image of a
      Corinthian courtezan. But this only shows that art, like other outward
      things, may be turned to good and also to evil, and is not more closely
      connected with the higher than with the lower part of the soul. All
      imitative art is subject to certain limitations, and therefore necessarily
      partakes of the nature of a compromise. Something of ideal truth is
      sacrificed for the sake of the representation, and something in the
      exactness of the representation is sacrificed to the ideal. Still, works
      of art have a permanent element; they idealize and detain the passing
      thought, and are the intermediates between sense and ideas.
    </p>
<p>
      In the present stage of the human mind, poetry and other forms of fiction
      may certainly be regarded as a good. But we can also imagine the existence
      of an age in which a severer conception of truth has either banished or
      transformed them. At any rate we must admit that they hold a different
      place at different periods of the world’s history. In the infancy of
      mankind, poetry, with the exception of proverbs, is the whole of
      literature, and the only instrument of intellectual culture; in modern
      times she is the shadow or echo of her former self, and appears to have a
      precarious existence. Milton in his day doubted whether an epic poem was
      any longer possible. At the same time we must remember, that what Plato
      would have called the charms of poetry have been partly transferred <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxiii"></a>clxiii</span> to prose; he himself (Statesman 304) admits rhetoric to be the
handmaiden of Politics, and proposes to find in the strain of law (Laws vii. 811) a substitute
      for the old poets. Among ourselves the creative power seems often to be
      growing weaker, and scientific fact to be more engrossing and overpowering
      to the mind than formerly. The illusion of the feelings commonly called
      love, has hitherto been the inspiring influence of modern poetry and
      romance, and has exercised a humanizing if not a strengthening influence
      on the world. But may not the stimulus which love has given to fancy be
      some day exhausted? The modern English novel which is the most popular of
      all forms of reading is not more than a century or two old: will the tale
      of love a hundred years hence, after so many thousand variations of the
      same theme, be still received with unabated interest?
    </p>
<p>
      Art cannot claim to be on a level with philosophy or religion, and may
      often corrupt them. It is possible to conceive a mental state in which all
      artistic representations are regarded as a false and imperfect expression,
      either of the religious ideal or of the philosophical ideal. The fairest
      forms may be revolting in certain moods of mind, as is proved by the fact
      that the Mahometans, and many sects of Christians, have renounced the use
      of pictures and images. The beginning of a great religion, whether
      Christian or Gentile, has not been ‘wood or stone,’ but a spirit moving in
      the hearts of men. The disciples have met in a large upper room or in
      ‘holes and caves of the earth’; in the second or third generation, they
      have had mosques, temples, churches, monasteries. And the revival or
      reform of religions, like the first revelation of them, has come from
      within and has generally disregarded external ceremonies and
      accompaniments.
    </p>
<p>
      But poetry and art may also be the expression of the highest truth and the
      purest sentiment. Plato himself seems to waver between two opposite views—when,
      as in the third Book, he insists that youth should be brought up amid
      wholesome imagery; and again in Book x, when he banishes the poets from
      his Republic. Admitting that the arts, which some of us almost deify, have
      fallen short of their higher aim, we must admit on the other hand that to
      banish imagination wholly would be suicidal <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxiv"></a>clxiv</span> as well as impossible. For
      nature too is a form of art; and a breath of the fresh air or a single
      glance at the varying landscape would in an instant revive and reillumine
      the extinguished spark of poetry in the human breast. In the lower stages
      of civilization imagination more than reason distinguishes man from the
      animals; and to banish art would be to banish thought, to banish language,
      to banish the expression of all truth. No religion is wholly devoid of
      external forms; even the Mahometan who renounces the use of pictures and
      images has a temple in which he worships the Most High, as solemn and
      beautiful as any Greek or Christian building. Feeling too and thought are
      not really opposed; for he who thinks must feel before he can execute. And
      the highest thoughts, when they become familiarized to us, are always
      tending to pass into the form of feeling.
    </p>
<p>
      Plato does not seriously intend to expel poets from life and society. But
      he feels strongly the unreality of their writings; he is protesting
      against the degeneracy of poetry in his own day as we might protest
      against the want of serious purpose in modern fiction, against the
      unseemliness or extravagance of some of our poets or novelists, against
      the time-serving of preachers or public writers, against the
      regardlessness of truth which to the eye of the philosopher seems to
      characterize the greater part of the world. For we too have reason to
      complain that our poets and novelists ‘paint inferior truth’ and ‘are
      concerned with the inferior part of the soul’; that the readers of them
      become what they read and are injuriously affected by them. And we look in
      vain for that healthy atmosphere of which Plato speaks,—‘the beauty
      which meets the sense like a breeze and imperceptibly draws the soul, even
      in childhood, into harmony with the beauty of reason.’
    </p>
<p>
      For there might be a poetry which would be the hymn of divine perfection,
      the harmony of goodness and truth among men: a strain which should renew
      the youth of the world, and bring back the ages in which the poet was
      man’s only teacher and best friend,—which would find materials in
      the living present as well as in the romance of the past, and might subdue
      to the fairest forms of speech and verse the intractable materials of
      modern civilisation,—which might elicit the simple principles, or,
      as Plato <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxv"></a>clxv</span> would have called them, the essential forms, of truth and justice
      out of the variety of opinion and the complexity of modern society,—which
      would preserve all the good of each generation and leave the bad unsung,—which
      should be based not on vain longings or faint imaginings, but on a clear
      insight into the nature of man. Then the tale of love might begin again in
      poetry or prose, two in one, united in the pursuit of knowledge, or the
      service of God and man; and feelings of love might still be the incentive
      to great thoughts and heroic deeds as in the days of Dante or Petrarch;
      and many types of manly and womanly beauty might appear among us, rising
      above the ordinary level of humanity, and many lives which were like poems
      (Laws vii. 817 B), be not only written, but lived by us. A few such strains have been
      heard among men in the tragedies of Æschylus and Sophocles, whom Plato
      quotes, not, as Homer is quoted by him, in irony, but with deep and
      serious approval,—in the poetry of Milton and Wordsworth, and in
      passages of other English poets,—first and above all in the Hebrew
      prophets and psalmists. Shakespeare has taught us how great men should
      speak and act; he has drawn characters of a wonderful purity and depth; he
      has ennobled the human mind, but, like Homer (Rep. x. <a href="#stpage599A" class="pginternal">599</a> foll.), he ‘has left no way
      of life.’ The next greatest poet of modern times, Goethe, is concerned
      with ‘a lower degree of truth’; he paints the world as a stage on which
      ‘all the men and women are merely players’; he cultivates life as an art,
      but he furnishes no ideals of truth and action. The poet may rebel against
      any attempt to set limits to his fancy; and he may argue truly that
      moralizing in verse is not poetry. Possibly, like Mephistopheles in Faust,
      he may retaliate on his adversaries. But the philosopher will still be
      justified in asking, ‘How may the heavenly gift of poesy be devoted to the
      good of mankind?’
    </p>
<p>
      Returning to Plato, we may observe that a similar mixture of truth and
      error appears in other parts of the argument. He is aware of the absurdity
      of mankind framing their whole lives according to Homer; just as in the
      Phaedrus he intimates the absurdity of interpreting mythology upon
      rational principles; both these were the modern tendencies of his own age,
      which he deservedly ridicules. On the other hand, his argument that <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxvi"></a>clxvi</span> Homer,
      if he had been able to teach mankind anything worth knowing, would not
      have been allowed by them to go about begging as a rhapsodist, is both
      false and contrary to the spirit of Plato (cp. Rep. vi. <a href="#stpage489A" class="pginternal">489 A</a> foll.). It may be compared with
      those other paradoxes of the Gorgias, that ‘No statesman was ever unjustly
      put to death by the city of which he was the head’; and that ‘No Sophist
      was ever defrauded by his pupils’ (Gorg. 509 foll.)….
    </p>
<p>
      The argument for immortality seems to rest on the absolute dualism of soul
      and body. Admitting the existence of the soul, we know of no force which
      is able to put an end to her. Vice is her own proper evil; and if she
      cannot be destroyed by that, she cannot be destroyed by any other. Yet
      Plato has acknowledged that the soul may be so overgrown by the
      incrustations of earth as to lose her original form; and in the Timaeus he
      recognizes more strongly than in the Republic the influence which the body
      has over the mind, denying even the voluntariness of human actions, on the
      ground that they proceed from physical states (Tim. 86, 87). In the Republic, as
      elsewhere, he wavers between the original soul which has to be restored,
      and the character which is developed by training and education….
    </p>
<p>
      The vision of another world is ascribed to Er, the son of Armenius, who is
      said by Clement of Alexandria to have been Zoroaster. The tale has
      certainly an oriental character, and may be compared with the pilgrimages
      of the soul in the Zend Avesta (cp. Haug, Avesta, p. 197). But no trace of
      acquaintance with Zoroaster is found elsewhere in Plato’s writings, and
      there is no reason for giving him the name of Er the Pamphylian. The
      philosophy of Heracleitus cannot be shown to be borrowed from Zoroaster,
      and still less the myths of Plato.
    </p>
<p>
      The local arrangement of the vision is less distinct than that of the
      Phaedrus and Phaedo. Astronomy is mingled with symbolism and mythology;
      the great sphere of heaven is represented under the symbol of a cylinder
      or box, containing the seven orbits of the planets and the fixed stars;
      this is suspended from an axis or spindle which turns on the knees of
      Necessity; the revolutions of the seven orbits contained in the cylinder
      are guided by the fates, and their harmonious motion produces <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxvii"></a>clxvii</span> the music of
      the spheres. Through the innermost or eighth of these, which is the moon,
      is passed the spindle; but it is doubtful whether this is the continuation
      of the column of light, from which the pilgrims contemplate the heavens;
      the words of Plato imply that they are connected, but not the same. The
      column itself is clearly not of adamant. The spindle (which is of adamant)
      is fastened to the ends of the chains which extend to the middle of the
      column of light—this column is said to hold together the heaven; but
      whether it hangs from the spindle, or is at right angles to it, is not
      explained. The cylinder containing the orbits of the stars is almost as
      much a symbol as the figure of Necessity turning the spindle;—for
      the outermost rim is the sphere of the fixed stars, and nothing is said
      about the intervals of space which divide the paths of the stars in the
      heavens. The description is both a picture and an orrery, and therefore is
      necessarily inconsistent with itself. The column of light is not the Milky
      Way—which is neither straight, nor like a rainbow—but the
      imaginary axis of the earth. This is compared to the rainbow in respect
      not of form but of colour, and not to the undergirders of a trireme, but
      to the straight rope running from prow to stern in which the undergirders
      meet.
    </p>
<p>
      The orrery or picture of the heavens given in the Republic differs in its
      mode of representation from the circles of the same and of the other in
      the Timaeus. In both the fixed stars are distinguished from the planets,
      and they move in orbits without them, although in an opposite direction:
      in the Republic as in the Timaeus (40 B) they are all moving round the axis of
      the world. But we are not certain that in the former they are moving round
      the earth. No distinct mention is made in the Republic of the circles of
      the same and other; although both in the Timaeus and in the Republic the
      motion of the fixed stars is supposed to coincide with the motion of the
      whole. The relative thickness of the rims is perhaps designed to express
      the relative distances of the planets. Plato probably intended to
      represent the earth, from which Er and his companions are viewing the
      heavens, as stationary in place; but whether or not herself revolving,
      unless this is implied in the revolution of the axis, is uncertain
      (cp. Timaeus). The spectator <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxviii"></a>clxviii</span> may be supposed to look at the heavenly bodies,
      either from above or below. The earth is a sort of earth and heaven in
      one, like the heaven of the Phaedrus, on the back of which the spectator
      goes out to take a peep at the stars and is borne round in the revolution.
      There is no distinction between the equator and the ecliptic. But Plato is
      no doubt led to imagine that the planets have an opposite motion to that
      of the fixed stars, in order to account for their appearances in the
      heavens. In the description of the meadow, and the retribution of the good
      and evil after death, there are traces of Homer.
    </p>
<p>
      The description of the axis as a spindle, and of the heavenly bodies as
      forming a whole, partly arises out of the attempt to connect the motions
      of the heavenly bodies with the mythological image of the web, or weaving
      of the Fates. The giving of the lots, the weaving of them, and the making
      of them irreversible, which are ascribed to the three Fates—Lachesis,
      Clotho, Atropos, are obviously derived from their names. The element of
      chance in human life is indicated by the order of the lots. But chance,
      however adverse, may be overcome by the wisdom of man, if he knows how to
      choose aright; there is a worse enemy to man than chance; this enemy is
      himself. He who was moderately fortunate in the number of the lot—even
      the very last comer—might have a good life if he chose with wisdom.
      And as Plato does not like to make an assertion which is unproven, he more
      than confirms this statement a few sentences afterwards by the example of
      Odysseus, who chose last. But the virtue which is founded on habit is not
      sufficient to enable a man to choose; he must add to virtue knowledge, if
      he is to act rightly when placed in new circumstances. The routine of good
      actions and good habits is an inferior sort of goodness; and, as Coleridge
      says, ‘Common sense is intolerable which is not based on metaphysics,’ so
      Plato would have said, ‘Habit is worthless which is not based upon
      philosophy.’
    </p>
<p>
      The freedom of the will to refuse the evil and to choose the good is
      distinctly asserted. ‘Virtue is free, and as a man honours or dishonours
      her he will have more or less of her.’ The life of man is ‘rounded’ by
      necessity; there are circumstances prior to birth which affect him (cp. Pol. 273 B).
      But within the walls of necessity there is an open space in which he is
      his own master, <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxix"></a>clxix</span> and can study for himself the effects which the variously
      compounded gifts of nature or fortune have upon the soul, and act
      accordingly. All men cannot have the first choice in everything. But the
      lot of all men is good enough, if they choose wisely and will live
      diligently.
    </p>
<p>
      The verisimilitude which is given to the pilgrimage of a thousand years,
      by the intimation that Ardiaeus had lived a thousand years before; the
      coincidence of Er coming to life on the twelfth day after he was supposed
      to have been dead with the seven days which the pilgrims passed in the
      meadow, and the four days during which they journeyed to the column of
      light; the precision with which the soul is mentioned who chose the
      twentieth lot; the passing remarks that there was no definite character
      among the souls, and that the souls which had chosen ill blamed any one
      rather than themselves; or that some of the souls drank more than was
      necessary of the waters of Forgetfulness, while Er himself was hindered
      from drinking; the desire of Odysseus to rest at last, unlike the
      conception of him in Dante and Tennyson; the feigned ignorance of how Er
      returned to the body, when the other souls went shooting like stars to
      their birth,—add greatly to the probability of the narrative. They
      are such touches of nature as the art of Defoe might have introduced when
      he wished to win credibility for marvels and apparitions.<br>

      There still remain to be considered some points which have been
      intentionally reserved to the end: (<a href="#inI" class="pginternal">I</a>) the Janus-like character of the
      Republic, which presents two faces—one an Hellenic state, the other
      a kingdom of philosophers. Connected with the latter of the two aspects
      are (<a href="#inII" class="pginternal">II</a>) the paradoxes of the Republic, as they have been termed by
      Morgenstern: (<a href="#inIIa" class="pginternal"><span class="transl" title="a">α</span></a>) the community of property; (<a href="#inIIb" class="pginternal"><span class="transl" title="b">β</span></a>) of families; (<a href="#inIIc" class="pginternal"><span class="transl" title="g">γ</span></a>) the rule
      of philosophers; (<a href="#inIId" class="pginternal"><span class="transl" title="d">δ</span></a>) the analogy of the individual and the State, which,
      like some other analogies in the Republic, is carried too far. We may then
      proceed to consider (<a href="#inIII" class="pginternal">III</a>) the subject of education as conceived by Plato,
      bringing together in a general view the education of youth and the
      education of after-life; (<a href="#inIV" class="pginternal">IV</a>) we may note further some essential
      differences between ancient and modern politics which are suggested by the
      Republic; <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxx"></a>clxx</span> (<a href="#inV" class="pginternal">V</a>) we may compare the Politicus and the Laws; (<a href="#inVI" class="pginternal">VI</a>) we may
      observe the influence exercised by Plato on his imitators; and (<a href="#inVII" class="pginternal">VII</a>) take
      occasion to consider the nature and value of political, and (<a href="#inVIII" class="pginternal">VIII</a>) of
      religious ideals.
    </p>
<p id="inI">
      I. Plato expressly says that he is intending to found an Hellenic State
      (Book v. <a href="#stpage470E" class="pginternal">470 E</a>). Many of his regulations are characteristically Spartan; such as
      the prohibition of gold and silver, the common meals of the men, the
      military training of the youth, the gymnastic exercises of the women. The
      life of Sparta was the life of a camp (Laws ii. 666 E), enforced even more rigidly
      in time of peace than in war; the citizens of Sparta, like Plato’s, were
      forbidden to trade—they were to be soldiers and not shopkeepers.
      Nowhere else in Greece was the individual so completely subjected to the
      State; the time when he was to marry, the education of his children, the
      clothes which he was to wear, the food which he was to eat, were all
      prescribed by law. Some of the best enactments in the Republic, such as
      the reverence to be paid to parents and elders, and some of the worst,
      such as the exposure of deformed children, are borrowed from the practice
      of Sparta. The encouragement of friendships between men and youths, or of
      men with one another, as affording incentives to bravery, is also Spartan;
      in Sparta too a nearer approach was made than in any other Greek State to
      equality of the sexes, and to community of property; and while there was
      probably less of licentiousness in the sense of immorality, the tie of
      marriage was regarded more lightly than in the rest of Greece. The
      ‘suprema lex’ was the preservation of the family, and the interest of the
      State. The coarse strength of a military government was not favourable to
      purity and refinement; and the excessive strictness of some regulations
      seems to have produced a reaction. Of all Hellenes the Spartans were most
      accessible to bribery; several of the greatest of them might be described
      in the words of Plato as having a ‘fierce secret longing after gold and
      silver.’ Though not in the strict sense communists, the principle of
      communism was maintained among them in their division of lands, in their
      common meals, in their slaves, and in the free use of one another’s goods.
      Marriage was a public institution: and the women were educated by the
      State, and sang and danced in public with the men.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxi"></a>clxxi</span> Many traditions were preserved at Sparta of the severity with which the
      magistrates had maintained the primitive rule of music and poetry; as in
      the Republic of Plato, the new-fangled poet was to be expelled. Hymns to
      the Gods, which are the only kind of music admitted into the ideal State,
      were the only kind which was permitted at Sparta. The Spartans, though an
      unpoetical race, were nevertheless lovers of poetry; they had been stirred
      by the Elegiac strains of Tyrtaeus, they had crowded around Hippias to
      hear his recitals of Homer; but in this they resembled the citizens of the
      timocratic rather than of the ideal State (<a href="#stpage548E" class="pginternal">548 E</a>). The council of elder men also
      corresponds to the Spartan <i>gerousia</i>; and the freedom with which they are
      permitted to judge about matters of detail agrees with what we are told of
      that institution. Once more, the military rule of not spoiling the dead or
      offering arms at the temples; the moderation in the pursuit of enemies;
      the importance attached to the physical well-being of the citizens; the
      use of warfare for the sake of defence rather than of aggression—are
      features probably suggested by the spirit and practice of Sparta.
    </p>
<p>
      To the Spartan type the ideal State reverts in the first decline; and the
      character of the individual timocrat is borrowed from the Spartan citizen.
      The love of Lacedaemon not only affected Plato and Xenophon, but was
      shared by many undistinguished Athenians; there they seemed to find a
      principle which was wanting in their own democracy. The <span class="transl" title="eu)kosmi/a">εὐκοσμία</span> of the
      Spartans attracted them, that is to say, not the goodness of their laws,
      but the spirit of order and loyalty which prevailed. Fascinated by the
      idea, citizens of Athens would imitate the Lacedaemonians in their dress
      and manners; they were known to the contemporaries of Plato as ‘the
      persons who had their ears bruised,’ like the Roundheads of the
      Commonwealth. The love of another church or country when seen at a
      distance only, the longing for an imaginary simplicity in civilized times,
      the fond desire of a past which never has been, or of a future which never
      will be,—these are aspirations of the human mind which are often
      felt among ourselves. Such feelings meet with a response in the Republic
      of Plato.
    </p>
<p>
      But there are other features of the Platonic Republic, as, for example,
      the literary and philosophical education, and the grace <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxii"></a>clxxii</span> and beauty of
      life, which are the reverse of Spartan. Plato wishes to give his citizens
      a taste of Athenian freedom as well as of Lacedaemonian discipline. His
      individual genius is purely Athenian, although in theory he is a lover of
      Sparta; and he is something more than either—he has also a true
      Hellenic feeling. He is desirous of humanizing the wars of Hellenes
      against one another; he acknowledges that the Delphian God is the grand
      hereditary interpreter of all Hellas. The spirit of harmony and the Dorian
      mode are to prevail, and the whole State is to have an external beauty
      which is the reflex of the harmony within. But he has not yet found out
      the truth which he afterwards enunciated in the Laws (i. 628 D)—that he was a
      better legislator who made men to be of one mind, than he who trained them
      for war. The citizens, as in other Hellenic States, democratic as well as
      aristocratic, are really an upper class; for, although no mention is made
      of slaves, the lower classes are allowed to fade away into the distance,
      and are represented in the individual by the passions. Plato has no idea
      either of a social State in which all classes are harmonized, or of a
      federation of Hellas or the world in which different nations or States
      have a place. His city is equipped for war rather than for peace, and this
      would seem to be justified by the ordinary condition of Hellenic States.
      The myth of the earth-born men is an embodiment of the orthodox tradition
      of Hellas, and the allusion to the four ages of the world is also
      sanctioned by the authority of Hesiod and the poets. Thus we see that the
      Republic is partly founded on the ideal of the old Greek <i>polis</i>, partly on
      the actual circumstances of Hellas in that age. Plato, like the old
      painters, retains the traditional form, and like them he has also a vision
      of a city in the clouds.
    </p>
<p>
      There is yet another thread which is interwoven in the texture of the
      work; for the Republic is not only a Dorian State, but a Pythagorean
      league. The ‘way of life’ which was connected with the name of Pythagoras,
      like the Catholic monastic orders, showed the power which the mind of an
      individual might exercise over his contemporaries, and may have naturally
      suggested to Plato the possibility of reviving such ‘mediaeval
      institutions.’ The Pythagoreans, like Plato, enforced a rule of life and a
      moral and intellectual training. The influence ascribed to music, which to
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxiii"></a>clxxiii</span> us seems exaggerated, is also a Pythagorean feature; it is not to be
      regarded as representing the real influence of music in the Greek world.
      More nearly than any other government of Hellas, the Pythagorean league of
      three hundred was an aristocracy of virtue. For once in the history of
      mankind the philosophy of order or <span class="transl" title="ko/smos">κόσμος</span>, expressing and consequently
      enlisting on its side the combined endeavours of the better part of the
      people, obtained the management of public affairs and held possession of
      it for a considerable time (until about <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 500). Probably only in States
      prepared by Dorian institutions would such a league have been possible.
      The rulers, like Plato’s <span class="transl" title="phu/lakes">φύλακες</span>, were required to submit to a severe
      training in order to prepare the way for the education of the other
      members of the community. Long after the dissolution of the Order, eminent
      Pythagoreans, such as Archytas of Tarentum, retained their political
      influence over the cities of Magna Graecia. There was much here that was
      suggestive to the kindred spirit of Plato, who had doubtless meditated
      deeply on the ‘way of life of Pythagoras’ (Rep. x. <a href="#stpage600B" class="pginternal">600 B</a>) and his followers. Slight
      traces of Pythagoreanism are to be found in the mystical number of the
      State, in the number which expresses the interval between the king and the
      tyrant, in the doctrine of transmigration, in the music of the spheres, as
      well as in the great though secondary importance ascribed to mathematics
      in education.
    </p>
<p>
      But as in his philosophy, so also in the form of his State, he goes far
      beyond the old Pythagoreans. He attempts a task really impossible, which
      is to unite the past of Greek history with the future of philosophy,
      analogous to that other impossibility, which has often been the dream of
      Christendom, the attempt to unite the past history of Europe with the
      kingdom of Christ. Nothing actually existing in the world at all resembles
      Plato’s ideal State; nor does he himself imagine that such a State is
      possible. This he repeats again and again; e.g. in the Republic (ix. <a href="#stpage592A" class="pginternal"><i>sub fin.</i></a>), or in the Laws (Book v. 739), where, casting a glance back on the Republic, he admits that the
      perfect state of communism and philosophy was impossible in his own age,
      though still to be retained as a pattern. The same doubt is implied in the
      earnestness with which he argues in the Republic (v. <a href="#stpage472D" class="pginternal">472 D</a>) that ideals are none the
      worse because they cannot be realized in fact, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxiv"></a>clxxiv</span> in the chorus of
      laughter, which like a breaking wave will, as he anticipates, greet the
      mention of his proposals; though like other writers of fiction, he uses
      all his art to give reality to his inventions. When asked how the ideal
      polity can come into being, he answers ironically, ‘When one son of a king
      becomes a philosopher’; he designates the fiction of the earth-born men as
      ‘a noble lie’; and when the structure is finally complete, he fairly tells
      you that his Republic is a vision only, which in some sense may have
      reality, but not in the vulgar one of a reign of philosophers upon earth.
      It has been said that Plato flies as well as walks, but this falls short
      of the truth; for he flies and walks at the same time, and is in the air
      and on firm ground in successive instants.
    </p>
<p>
      Niebuhr has asked a trifling question, which may be briefly noticed in
      this place—Was Plato a good citizen? If by this is meant, Was he
      loyal to Athenian institutions?—he can hardly be said to be the
      friend of democracy: but neither is he the friend of any other existing
      form of government; all of them he regarded as ‘states of faction’ (Laws viii. 832 C);
      none attained to his ideal of a voluntary rule over voluntary subjects,
      which seems indeed more nearly to describe democracy than any other; and
      the worst of them is tyranny. The truth is, that the question has hardly
      any meaning when applied to a great philosopher whose writings are not
      meant for a particular age and country, but for all time and all mankind.
      The decline of Athenian politics was probably the motive which led Plato
      to frame an ideal State, and the Republic may be regarded as reflecting
      the departing glory of Hellas. As well might we complain of St. Augustine,
      whose great work ‘The City of God’ originated in a similar motive, for not
      being loyal to the Roman Empire. Even a nearer parallel might be afforded
      by the first Christians, who cannot fairly be charged with being bad
      citizens because, though ‘subject to the higher powers,’ they were looking
      forward to a city which is in heaven.
    </p>
<p id="inII">
      II. The idea of the perfect State is full of paradox when judged of
      according to the ordinary notions of mankind. The paradoxes of one age
      have been said to become the commonplaces of the next; but the paradoxes
      of Plato are at least as paradoxical to us as they were to his
      contemporaries. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxv"></a>clxxv</span> modern world has either sneered at them as absurd, or
      denounced them as unnatural and immoral; men have been pleased to find in
      Aristotle’s criticisms of them the anticipation of their own good sense.
      The wealthy and cultivated classes have disliked and also dreaded them;
      they have pointed with satisfaction to the failure of efforts to realize
      them in practice. Yet since they are the thoughts of one of the greatest
      of human intelligences, and of one who had done most to elevate morality
      and religion, they seem to deserve a better treatment at our hands. We may
      have to address the public, as Plato does poetry, and assure them that we
      mean no harm to existing institutions. There are serious errors which have
      a side of truth and which therefore may fairly demand a careful
      consideration: there are truths mixed with error of which we may indeed
      say, ‘The half is better than the whole.’ Yet ‘the half’ may be an
      important contribution to the study of human nature.
    </p>
<p id="inIIa">
      (<span class="transl" title="a">α</span>) The first paradox is the community of goods, which is mentioned
      slightly at the end of the third Book, and seemingly, as Aristotle
      observes, is confined to the guardians; at least no mention is made of the
      other classes. But the omission is not of any real significance, and
      probably arises out of the plan of the work, which prevents the writer
      from entering into details.
    </p>
<p>
      Aristotle censures the community of property much in the spirit of modern
      political economy, as tending to repress industry, and as doing away with
      the spirit of benevolence. Modern writers almost refuse to consider the
      subject, which is supposed to have been long ago settled by the common
      opinion of mankind. But it must be remembered that the sacredness of
      property is a notion far more fixed in modern than in ancient times. The
      world has grown older, and is therefore more conservative. Primitive
      society offered many examples of land held in common, either by a tribe or
      by a township, and such may probably have been the original form of landed
      tenure. Ancient legislators had invented various modes of dividing and
      preserving the divisions of land among the citizens; according to
      Aristotle there were nations who held the land in common and divided the
      produce, and there were others who divided the land and stored the produce
      in common. The evils of debt and the inequality of property were far
      greater in ancient than in modern <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxvi"></a>clxxvi</span> times, and the accidents to which
      property was subject from war, or revolution, or taxation, or other
      legislative interference, were also greater. All these circumstances gave
      property a less fixed and sacred character. The early Christians are
      believed to have held their property in common, and the principle is
      sanctioned by the words of Christ himself, and has been maintained as a
      counsel of perfection in almost all ages of the Church. Nor have there
      been wanting instances of modern enthusiasts who have made a religion of
      communism; in every age of religious excitement notions like Wycliffe’s
      ‘inheritance of grace’ have tended to prevail. A like spirit, but fiercer
      and more violent, has appeared in politics. ‘The preparation of the Gospel
      of peace’ soon becomes the red flag of Republicanism.
    </p>
<p>
      We can hardly judge what effect Plato’s views would have upon his own
      contemporaries; they would perhaps have seemed to them only an
      exaggeration of the Spartan commonwealth. Even modern writers would
      acknowledge that the right of private property is based on expediency, and
      may be interfered with in a variety of ways for the public good. Any other
      mode of vesting property which was found to be more advantageous, would in
      time acquire the same basis of right; ‘the most useful,’ in Plato’s words,
      ‘would be the most sacred.’ The lawyers and ecclesiastics of former ages
      would have spoken of property as a sacred institution. But they only meant
      by such language to oppose the greatest amount of resistance to any
      invasion of the rights of individuals and of the Church.
    </p>
<p>
      When we consider the question, without any fear of immediate application
      to practice, in the spirit of Plato’s Republic, are we quite sure that the
      received notions of property are the best? Is the distribution of wealth
      which is customary in civilized countries the most favourable that can be
      conceived for the education and development of the mass of mankind? Can
      ‘the spectator of all time and all existence’ be quite convinced that one
      or two thousand years hence, great changes will not have taken place in
      the rights of property, or even that the very notion of property, beyond
      what is necessary for personal maintenance, may not have disappeared? This
      was a distinction familiar to Aristotle, though likely to be laughed at
      among ourselves. Such a change would not be greater than some other
      changes through <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxvii"></a>clxxvii</span> which the world has passed in the transition from ancient
      to modern society, for example, the emancipation of the serfs in Russia,
      or the abolition of slavery in America and the West Indies; and not so
      great as the difference which separates the Eastern village community from
      the Western world. To accomplish such a revolution in the course of a few
      centuries, would imply a rate of progress not more rapid than has actually
      taken place during the last fifty or sixty years. The kingdom of Japan
      underwent more change in five or six years than Europe in five or six
      hundred. Many opinions and beliefs which have been cherished among
      ourselves quite as strongly as the sacredness of property have passed
      away; and the most untenable propositions respecting the right of bequests
      or entail have been maintained with as much fervour as the most moderate.
      Some one will be heard to ask whether a state of society can be final in
      which the interests of thousands are perilled on the life or character of
      a single person. And many will indulge the hope that our present condition
      may, after all, be only transitional, and may conduct to a higher, in
      which property, besides ministering to the enjoyment of the few, may also
      furnish the means of the highest culture to all, and will be a greater
      benefit to the public generally, and also more under the control of public
      authority. There may come a time when the saying, ‘Have I not a right to
      do what I will with my own?’ will appear to be a barbarous relic of
      individualism;—when the possession of a part may be a greater
      blessing to each and all than the possession of the whole is now to any
      one.
    </p>
<p>
      Such reflections appear visionary to the eye of the practical statesman,
      but they are within the range of possibility to the philosopher. He can
      imagine that in some distant age or clime, and through the influence of
      some individual, the notion of common property may or might have sunk as
      deep into the heart of a race, and have become as fixed to them, as
      private property is to ourselves. He knows that this latter institution is
      not more than four or five thousand years old: may not the end revert to
      the beginning? In our own age even Utopias affect the spirit of
      legislation, and an abstract idea may exercise a great influence on
      practical politics.
    </p>
<p>
      The objections that would be generally urged against Plato’s community of
      property, are the old ones of Aristotle, that motives <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxviii"></a>clxxviii</span> for exertion would
      be taken away, and that disputes would arise when each was dependent upon
      all. Every man would produce as little and consume as much as he liked.
      The experience of civilized nations has hitherto been adverse to
      Socialism. The effort is too great for human nature; men try to live in
      common, but the personal feeling is always breaking in. On the other hand
      it may be doubted whether our present notions of property are not
      conventional, for they differ in different countries and in different
      states of society. We boast of an individualism which is not freedom, but
      rather an artificial result of the industrial state of modern Europe. The
      individual is nominally free, but he is also powerless in a world bound
      hand and foot in the chains of economic necessity. Even if we cannot
      expect the mass of mankind to become disinterested, at any rate we observe
      in them a power of organization which fifty years ago would never have
      been suspected. The same forces which have revolutionized the political
      system of Europe, may effect a similar change in the social and industrial
      relations of mankind. And if we suppose the influence of some good as well
      as neutral motives working in the community, there will be no absurdity in
      expecting that the mass of mankind having power, and becoming enlightened
      about the higher possibilities of human life, when they learn how much
      more is attainable for all than is at present the possession of a favoured
      few, may pursue the common interest with an intelligence and persistency
      which mankind have hitherto never seen.
    </p>
<p>
      Now that the world has once been set in motion, and is no longer held fast
      under the tyranny of custom and ignorance; now that criticism has pierced
      the veil of tradition and the past no longer overpowers the present,—the
      progress of civilization may be expected to be far greater and swifter
      than heretofore. Even at our present rate of speed the point at which we
      may arrive in two or three generations is beyond the power of imagination
      to foresee. There are forces in the world which work, not in an
      arithmetical, but in a geometrical ratio of increase. Education, to use
      the expression of Plato, moves like a wheel with an ever-multiplying
      rapidity. Nor can we say how great may be its influence, when it becomes
      universal,—when it has been inherited by many generations,—when
      it is freed from the trammels <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxix"></a>clxxix</span> of superstition and rightly adapted to the
      wants and capacities of different classes of men and women. Neither do we
      know how much more the co-operation of minds or of hands may be capable of
      accomplishing, whether in labour or in study. The resources of the natural
      sciences are not half-developed as yet; the soil of the earth, instead of
      growing more barren, may become many times more fertile than hitherto; the
      uses of machinery far greater, and also more minute than at present. New
      secrets of physiology may be revealed, deeply affecting human nature in
      its innermost recesses. The standard of health may be raised and the lives
      of men prolonged by sanitary and medical knowledge. There may be peace,
      there may be leisure, there may be innocent refreshments of many kinds.
      The ever-increasing power of locomotion may join the extremes of earth.
      There may be mysterious workings of the human mind, such as occur only at
      great crises of history. The East and the West may meet together, and all
      nations may contribute their thoughts and their experience to the common
      stock of humanity. Many other elements enter into a speculation of this
      kind. But it is better to make an end of them. For such reflections appear
      to the majority far-fetched, and to men of science, commonplace.
    </p>
<p id="inIIb">
      (<span class="transl" title="b">β</span>) Neither to the mind of Plato nor of Aristotle did the doctrine of
      community of property present at all the same difficulty, or appear to be
      the same violation of the common Hellenic sentiment, as the community of
      wives and children. This paradox he prefaces by another proposal, that the
      occupations of men and women shall be the same, and that to this end they
      shall have a common training and education. Male and female animals have
      the same pursuits—why not also the two sexes of man?
    </p>
<p>
      But have we not here fallen into a contradiction? for we were saying that
      different natures should have different pursuits. How then can men and
      women have the same? And is not the proposal inconsistent with our notion
      of the division of labour?—These objections are no sooner raised
      than answered; for, according to Plato, there is no organic difference
      between men and women, but only the accidental one that men beget and
      women bear children. Following the analogy of the other animals, he
      contends that all natural gifts are scattered about indifferently among
      both sexes, though there may be a superiority of degree <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxx"></a>clxxx</span> on the part of the
      men. The objection on the score of decency to their taking part in the
      same gymnastic exercises, is met by Plato’s assertion that the existing
      feeling is a matter of habit.
    </p>
<p>
      That Plato should have emancipated himself from the ideas of his own
      country and from the example of the East, shows a wonderful independence
      of mind. He is conscious that women are half the human race, in some
      respects the more important half (Laws vi. 781 B); and for the sake both of men and
      women he desires to raise the woman to a higher level of existence. He
      brings, not sentiment, but philosophy to bear upon a question which both
      in ancient and modern times has been chiefly regarded in the light of
      custom or feeling. The Greeks had noble conceptions of womanhood in the
      goddesses Athene and Artemis, and in the heroines Antigone and Andromache.
      But these ideals had no counterpart in actual life. The Athenian woman was
      in no way the equal of her husband; she was not the entertainer of his
      guests or the mistress of his house, but only his housekeeper and the
      mother of his children. She took no part in military or political matters;
      nor is there any instance in the later ages of Greece of a woman becoming
      famous in literature. ‘Hers is the greatest glory who has the least renown
      among men,’ is the historian’s conception of feminine excellence. A very
      different ideal of womanhood is held up by Plato to the world; she is to
      be the companion of the man, and to share with him in the toils of war and
      in the cares of government. She is to be similarly trained both in bodily
      and mental exercises. She is to lose as far as possible the incidents of
      maternity and the characteristics of the female sex.
    </p>
<p>
      The modern antagonist of the equality of the sexes would argue that the
      differences between men and women are not confined to the single point
      urged by Plato; that sensibility, gentleness, grace, are the qualities of
      women, while energy, strength, higher intelligence, are to be looked for
      in men. And the criticism is just: the differences affect the whole
      nature, and are not, as Plato supposes, confined to a single point. But
      neither can we say how far these differences are due to education and the
      opinions of mankind, or physically inherited from the habits and opinions
      of former generations. Women have been always taught, not exactly that
      they are slaves, but that they are in an inferior <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxxi"></a>clxxxi</span> position, which is also
      supposed to have compensating advantages; and to this position they have
      conformed. It is also true that the physical form may easily change in the
      course of generations through the mode of life; and the weakness or
      delicacy, which was once a matter of opinion, may become a physical fact.
      The characteristics of sex vary greatly in different countries and ranks
      of society, and at different ages in the same individuals. Plato may have
      been right in denying that there was any ultimate difference in the sexes
      of man other than that which exists in animals, because all other
      differences may be conceived to disappear in other states of society, or
      under different circumstances of life and training.

<p>
      The first wave having been passed, we proceed to the second—community
      of wives and children. ‘Is it possible? Is it desirable?’ For as Glaucon
      intimates, and as we far more strongly insist, ‘Great doubts may be
      entertained about both these points.’ Any free discussion of the question
      is impossible, and mankind are perhaps right in not allowing the ultimate
      bases of social life to be examined. Few of us can safely enquire into the
      things which nature hides, any more than we can dissect our own bodies.
      Still, the manner in which Plato arrived at his conclusions should be
      considered. For here, as Mr. Grote has remarked, is a wonderful thing,
      that one of the wisest and best of men should have entertained ideas of
      morality which are wholly at variance with our own. And if we would do
      Plato justice, we must examine carefully the character of his proposals.
      First, we may observe that the relations of the sexes supposed by him are
      the reverse of licentious: he seems rather to aim at an impossible
      strictness. Secondly, he conceives the family to be the natural enemy of
      the state; and he entertains the serious hope that an universal
      brotherhood may take the place of private interests—an aspiration
      which, although not justified by experience, has possessed many noble
      minds. On the other hand, there is no sentiment or imagination in the
      connections which men and women are supposed by him to form; human beings
      return to the level of the animals, neither exalting to heaven, nor yet
      abusing the natural instincts. All that world of poetry and fancy which
      the passion of love has called forth in modern literature and romance
      would have been banished by Plato. The arrangements <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxxii"></a>clxxxii</span> of marriage in the
      Republic are directed to one object—the improvement of the race. In
      successive generations a great development both of bodily and mental
      qualities might be possible. The analogy of animals tends to show that
      mankind can within certain limits receive a change of nature. And as in
      animals we should commonly choose the best for breeding, and destroy the
      others, so there must be a selection made of the human beings whose lives
      are worthy to be preserved.
    </p>
<p>
      We start back horrified from this Platonic ideal, in the belief, first,
      that the higher feelings of humanity are far too strong to be crushed out;
      secondly, that if the plan could be carried into execution we should be
      poorly recompensed by improvements in the breed for the loss of the best
      things in life. The greatest regard for the weakest and meanest of human
      beings—the infant, the criminal, the insane, the idiot, truly seems
      to us one of the noblest results of Christianity. We have learned, though
      as yet imperfectly, that the individual man has an endless value in the
      sight of God, and that we honour Him when we honour the darkened and
      disfigured image of Him (cp. Laws xi. 931 A). This is the lesson which Christ taught in
      a parable when He said, ‘Their angels do always behold the face of My
      Father which is in heaven.’ Such lessons are only partially realized in
      any age; they were foreign to the age of Plato, as they have very
      different degrees of strength in different countries or ages of the
      Christian world. To the Greek the family was a religious and customary
      institution binding the members together by a tie inferior in strength to
      that of friendship, and having a less solemn and sacred sound than that of
      country. The relationship which existed on the lower level of custom,
      Plato imagined that he was raising to the higher level of nature and
      reason; while from the modern and Christian point of view we regard him as
      sanctioning murder and destroying the first principles of morality.
    </p>
<p>
      The great error in these and similar speculations is that the difference
      between man and the animals is forgotten in them. The human being is
      regarded with the eye of a dog- or bird-fancier (v. <a href="#stpage459A" class="pginternal">459 A</a>), or at best of a
      slave-owner; the higher or human qualities are left out. The breeder of
      animals aims chiefly at size or speed or strength; in a few cases at
      courage or temper; most often the fitness of the animal for food is the
      great desideratum. <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxxiii"></a>clxxxiii</span> But mankind are not bred to be eaten, nor yet for their
      superiority in fighting or in running or in drawing carts. Neither does
      the improvement of the human race consist merely in the increase of the
      bones and flesh, but in the growth and enlightenment of the mind. Hence
      there must be ‘a marriage of true minds’ as well as of bodies, of
      imagination and reason as well as of lusts and instincts. Men and women
      without feeling or imagination are justly called brutes; yet Plato takes
      away these qualities and puts nothing in their place, not even the desire
      of a noble offspring, since parents are not to know their own children.
      The most important transaction of social life, he who is the idealist
      philosopher converts into the most brutal. For the pair are to have no
      relation to one another, except at the hymeneal festival; their children
      are not theirs, but the state’s; nor is any tie of affection to unite
      them. Yet here the analogy of the animals might have saved Plato from a
      gigantic error, if he had ‘not lost sight of his own illustration’ (ii. <a href="#stpage375D" class="pginternal">375 D</a>). For
      the ‘nobler sort of birds and beasts’ (v. <a href="#stpage459A" class="pginternal">459 A</a>) nourish and protect their offspring
      and are faithful to one another.
    </p>
<p>
      An eminent physiologist thinks it worth while ‘to try and place life on a
      physical basis.’ But should not life rest on the moral rather than upon
      the physical? The higher comes first, then the lower, first the human and
      rational, afterwards the animal. Yet they are not absolutely divided; and
      in times of sickness or moments of self-indulgence they seem to be only
      different aspects of a common human nature which includes them both.
      Neither is the moral the limit of the physical, but the expansion and
      enlargement of it,—the highest form which the physical is capable of
      receiving. As Plato would say, the body does not take care of the body,
      and still less of the mind, but the mind takes care of both. In all human
      action not that which is common to man and the animals is the
      characteristic element, but that which distinguishes him from them. Even
      if we admit the physical basis, and resolve all virtue into health of body
      ‘<i>la façon que notre sang circule</i>,’ still on merely physical grounds we
      must come back to ideas. Mind and reason and duty and conscience, under
      these or other names, are always reappearing. There cannot be health of
      body without health of mind; nor health of mind without the sense of duty
      and the love of truth (cp. Charm. 156 D, E).
    </p>
<p>
      That the greatest of ancient philosophers should in his regulations <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxxiv"></a>clxxxiv</span> about
      marriage have fallen into the error of separating body and mind, does
      indeed appear surprising. Yet the wonder is not so much that Plato should
      have entertained ideas of morality which to our own age are revolting, but
      that he should have contradicted himself to an extent which is hardly
      credible, falling in an instant from the heaven of idealism into the
      crudest animalism. Rejoicing in the newly found gift of reflection, he
      appears to have thought out a subject about which he had better have
      followed the enlightened feeling of his own age. The general sentiment of
      Hellas was opposed to his monstrous fancy. The old poets, and in later
      time the tragedians, showed no want of respect for the family, on which
      much of their religion was based. But the example of Sparta, and perhaps
      in some degree the tendency to defy public opinion, seems to have misled
      him. He will make one family out of all the families of the state. He will
      select the finest specimens of men and women and breed from these only.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet because the illusion is always returning (for the animal part of human
      nature will from time to time assert itself in the disguise of philosophy
      as well as of poetry), and also because any departure from established
      morality, even where this is not intended, is apt to be unsettling, it may
      be worth while to draw out a little more at length the objections to the
      Platonic marriage. In the first place, history shows that wherever
      polygamy has been largely allowed the race has deteriorated. One man to
      one woman is the law of God and nature. Nearly all the civilized peoples
      of the world at some period before the age of written records, have become
      monogamists; and the step when once taken has never been retraced. The
      exceptions occurring among Brahmins or Mahometans or the ancient Persians,
      are of that sort which may be said to prove the rule. The connexions
      formed between superior and inferior races hardly ever produce a noble
      offspring, because they are licentious; and because the children in such
      cases usually despise the mother and are neglected by the father who is
      ashamed of them. Barbarous nations when they are introduced by Europeans
      to vice die out; polygamist peoples either import and adopt children from
      other countries, or dwindle in numbers, or both. Dynasties and
      aristocracies which have disregarded the laws of nature have decreased in
      numbers and degenerated in <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxxv"></a>clxxxv</span> stature; ‘mariages de convenance’ leave their
      enfeebling stamp on the offspring of them (cp. King Lear, Act i. Sc. 2). The marriage of
      near relations, or the marrying in and in of the same family tends
      constantly to weakness or idiocy in the children, sometimes assuming the
      form as they grow older of passionate licentiousness. The common
      prostitute rarely has any offspring. By such unmistakable evidence is the
      authority of morality asserted in the relations of the sexes: and so many
      more elements enter into this ‘mystery’ than are dreamed of by Plato and
      some other philosophers.
    </p>
<p>
      Recent enquirers have indeed arrived at the conclusion that among
      primitive tribes there existed a community of wives as of property, and
      that the captive taken by the spear was the only wife or slave whom any
      man was permitted to call his own. The partial existence of such customs
      among some of the lower races of man, and the survival of peculiar
      ceremonies in the marriages of some civilized nations, are thought to
      furnish a proof of similar institutions having been once universal. There
      can be no question that the study of anthropology has considerably changed
      our views respecting the first appearance of man upon the earth. We know
      more about the aborigines of the world than formerly, but our increasing
      knowledge shows above all things how little we know. With all the helps
      which written monuments afford, we do but faintly realize the condition of
      man two thousand or three thousand years ago. Of what his condition was
      when removed to a distance 200,000 or 300,000 years, when the majority of
      mankind were lower and nearer the animals than any tribe now existing upon
      the earth, we cannot even entertain conjecture. Plato (Laws iii. 676 foll.) and Aristotle (Metaph. xi. 8, §§ 19, 20) may have been more right than we imagine in supposing that some
      forms of civilisation were discovered and lost several times over. If we
      cannot argue that all barbarism is a degraded civilization, neither can we
      set any limits to the depth of degradation to which the human race may
      sink through war, disease, or isolation. And if we are to draw inferences
      about the origin of marriage from the practice of barbarous nations, we
      should also consider the remoter analogy of the animals. Many birds and
      animals, especially the carnivorous, have only one mate, and the love and
      care of offspring which seems to be natural is inconsistent <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxxvi"></a>clxxxvi</span> with the
      primitive theory of marriage. If we go back to an imaginary state in which
      men were almost animals and the companions of them, we have as much right
      to argue from what is animal to what is human as from the barbarous to the
      civilized man. The record of animal life on the globe is fragmentary,—the
      connecting links are wanting and cannot be supplied; the record of social
      life is still more fragmentary and precarious. Even if we admit that our
      first ancestors had no such institution as marriage, still the stages by
      which men passed from outer barbarism to the comparative civilization of
      China, Assyria, and Greece, or even of the ancient Germans, are wholly
      unknown to us.
    </p>
<p>
      Such speculations are apt to be unsettling, because they seem to show that
      an institution which was thought to be a revelation from heaven, is only
      the growth of history and experience. We ask what is the origin of
      marriage, and we are told that like the right of property, after many wars
      and contests, it has gradually arisen out of the selfishness of
      barbarians. We stand face to face with human nature in its primitive
      nakedness. We are compelled to accept, not the highest, but the lowest
      account of the origin of human society. But on the other hand we may truly
      say that every step in human progress has been in the same direction, and
      that in the course of ages the idea of marriage and of the family has been
      more and more defined and consecrated. The civilized East is immeasurably
      in advance of any savage tribes; the Greeks and Romans have improved upon
      the East; the Christian nations have been stricter in their views of the
      marriage relation than any of the ancients. In this as in so many other
      things, instead of looking back with regret to the past, we should look
      forward with hope to the future. We must consecrate that which we believe
      to be the most holy, and that ‘which is the most holy will be the most
      useful.’ There is more reason for maintaining the sacredness of the
      marriage tie, when we see the benefit of it, than when we only felt a
      vague religious horror about the violation of it. But in all times of
      transition, when established beliefs are being undermined, there is a
      danger that in the passage from the old to the new we may insensibly let
      go the moral principle, finding an excuse for listening to the voice of
      passion in the uncertainty of knowledge, or the <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxxvii"></a>clxxxvii</span> fluctuations of opinion.
      And there are many persons in our own day who, enlightened by the study of
      anthropology, and fascinated by what is new and strange, some using the
      language of fear, others of hope, are inclined to believe that a time will
      come when through the self-assertion of women, or the rebellious spirit of
      children, by the analysis of human relations, or by the force of outward
      circumstances, the ties of family life may be broken or greatly relaxed.
      They point to societies in America and elsewhere which tend to show that
      the destruction of the family need not necessarily involve the overthrow
      of all morality. Wherever we may think of such speculations, we can hardly
      deny that they have been more rife in this generation than in any other;
      and whither they are tending, who can predict?
    </p>
<p>
      To the doubts and queries raised by these ‘social reformers’ respecting
      the relation of the sexes and the moral nature of man, there is a
      sufficient answer, if any is needed. The difference about them and us is
      really one of fact. They are speaking of man as they wish or fancy him to
      be, but we are speaking of him as he is. They isolate the animal part of
      his nature; we regard him as a creature having many sides, or aspects,
      moving between good and evil, striving to rise above himself and to become
      ‘a little lower than the angels.’ We also, to use a Platonic formula, are
      not ignorant of the dissatisfactions and incompatibilities of family life,
      of the meannesses of trade, of the flatteries of one class of society by
      another, of the impediments which the family throws in the way of lofty
      aims and aspirations. But we are conscious that there are evils and
      dangers in the background greater still, which are not appreciated,
      because they are either concealed or suppressed. What a condition of man
      would that be, in which human passions were controlled by no authority,
      divine or human, in which there was no shame or decency, no higher
      affection overcoming or sanctifying the natural instincts, but simply a
      rule of health! Is it for this that we are asked to throw away the
      civilization which is the growth of ages?
    </p>
<p>
      For strength and health are not the only qualities to be desired; there
      are the more important considerations of mind and character and soul. We
      know how human nature may be degraded; we do not know how by artificial
      means any improvement in the breed can be effected. The problem is a
      complex one, for if we <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxxviii"></a>clxxxviii</span> go back only four steps (and these at least enter
      into the composition of a child), there are commonly thirty progenitors to
      be taken into account. Many curious facts, rarely admitting of proof, are
      told us respecting the inheritance of disease or character from a remote
      ancestor. We can trace the physical resemblances of parents and children
      in the same family—
    </p>
<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="noind">
‘Sic oculos, sic ille manus, sic ora ferebat’;
</p></div></div>
<p class="noind">
      but scarcely less often the differences which distinguish children both
      from their parents and from one another. We are told of similar mental
      peculiarities running in families, and again of a tendency, as in the
      animals, to revert to a common or original stock. But we have a difficulty
      in distinguishing what is a true inheritance of genius or other qualities,
      and what is mere imitation or the result of similar circumstances. Great
      men and great women have rarely had great fathers and mothers. Nothing
      that we know of in the circumstances of their birth or lineage will
      explain their appearance. Of the English poets of the last and two
      preceding centuries scarcely a descendant remains,—none have ever
      been distinguished. So deeply has nature hidden her secret, and so
      ridiculous is the fancy which has been entertained by some that we might
      in time by suitable marriage arrangements or, as Plato would have said,
      ‘by an ingenious system of lots,’ produce a Shakespeare or a Milton. Even
      supposing that we could breed men having the tenacity of bulldogs, or,
      like the Spartans, ‘lacking the wit to run away in battle,’ would the
      world be any the better? Many of the noblest specimens of the human race
      have been among the weakest physically. Tyrtaeus or Aesop, or our own
      Newton, would have been exposed at Sparta; and some of the fairest and
      strongest men and women have been among the wickedest and worst. Not by
      the Platonic device of uniting the strong and fair with the strong and
      fair, regardless of sentiment and morality, nor yet by his other device of
      combining dissimilar natures (Statesman 310 A), have mankind gradually passed
      from the brutality and licentiousness of primitive marriage to marriage
      Christian and civilized.
    </p>
<p>
      Few persons would deny that we bring into the world an inheritance of
      mental and physical qualities derived first from our parents, or through
      them from some remoter ancestor, <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageclxxxix"></a>clxxxix</span> secondly from our race, thirdly from the
      general condition of mankind into which we are born. Nothing is commoner
      than the remark, that ‘So and so is like his father or his uncle’; and an
      aged person may not unfrequently note a resemblance in a youth to a
      long-forgotten ancestor, observing that ‘Nature sometimes skips a
      generation.’ It may be true also, that if we knew more about our
      ancestors, these similarities would be even more striking to us. Admitting
      the facts which are thus described in a popular way, we may however remark
      that there is no method of difference by which they can be defined or
      estimated, and that they constitute only a small part of each individual.
      The doctrine of heredity may seem to take out of our hands the conduct of
      our own lives, but it is the idea, not the fact, which is really terrible
      to us. For what we have received from our ancestors is only a fraction of
      what we are, or may become. The knowledge that drunkenness or insanity has
      been prevalent in a family may be the best safeguard against their
      recurrence in a future generation. The parent will be most awake to the
      vices or diseases in his child of which he is most sensible within
      himself. The whole of life may be directed to their prevention or cure.
      The traces of consumption may become fainter, or be wholly effaced: the
      inherent tendency to vice or crime may be eradicated. And so heredity,
      from being a curse, may become a blessing. We acknowledge that in the
      matter of our birth, as in our nature generally, there are previous
      circumstances which affect us. But upon this platform of circumstances or
      within this wall of necessity, we have still the power of creating a life
      for ourselves by the informing energy of the human will.
    </p>
<p>
      There is another aspect of the marriage question to which Plato is a
      stranger. All the children born in his state are foundlings. It never
      occurred to him that the greater part of them, according to universal
      experience, would have perished. For children can only be brought up in
      families. There is a subtle sympathy between the mother and the child
      which cannot be supplied by other mothers, or by ‘strong nurses one or
      more’ (Laws vii. 789 E). If Plato’s ‘pen’ was as fatal as the Crèches of Paris, or
      the foundling hospital of Dublin, more than nine-tenths of his children
      would have perished. There would have been no need to expose or put out of
      the way the weaklier children, for they would have <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxc"></a>cxc</span> died of themselves. So
      emphatically does nature protest against the destruction of the family.
    </p>
<p>
      What Plato had heard or seen of Sparta was applied by him in a mistaken
      way to his ideal commonwealth. He probably observed that both the Spartan
      men and women were superior in form and strength to the other Greeks; and
      this superiority he was disposed to attribute to the laws and customs
      relating to marriage. He did not consider that the desire of a noble
      offspring was a passion among the Spartans, or that their physical
      superiority was to be attributed chiefly, not to their marriage customs,
      but to their temperance and training. He did not reflect that Sparta was
      great, not in consequence of the relaxation of morality, but in spite of
      it, by virtue of a political principle stronger far than existed in any
      other Grecian state. Least of all did he observe that Sparta did not
      really produce the finest specimens of the Greek race. The genius, the
      political inspiration of Athens, the love of liberty—all that has
      made Greece famous with posterity, were wanting among the Spartans. They
      had no Themistocles, or Pericles, or Aeschylus, or Sophocles, or Socrates,
      or Plato. The individual was not allowed to appear above the state; the
      laws were fixed, and he had no business to alter or reform them. Yet
      whence has the progress of cities and nations arisen, if not from
      remarkable individuals, coming into the world we know not how, and from
      causes over which we have no control? Something too much may have been
      said in modern times of the value of individuality. But we can hardly
      condemn too strongly a system which, instead of fostering the scattered
      seeds or sparks of genius and character, tends to smother and extinguish
      them.
    </p>
<p>
      Still, while condemning Plato, we must acknowledge that neither
      Christianity, nor any other form of religion and society, has hitherto
      been able to cope with this most difficult of social problems, and that
      the side from which Plato regarded it is that from which we turn away.
      Population is the most untameable force in the political and social world.
      Do we not find, especially in large cities, that the greatest hindrance to
      the amelioration of the poor is their improvidence in marriage?—a
      small fault truly, if not involving endless consequences. There are whole
      countries too, such as India, or, nearer home, Ireland, in which a <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxci"></a>cxci</span> right
      solution of the marriage question seems to lie at the foundation of the
      happiness of the community. There are too many people on a given space, or
      they marry too early and bring into the world a sickly and half-developed
      offspring; or owing to the very conditions of their existence, they become
      emaciated and hand on a similar life to their descendants. But who can
      oppose the voice of prudence to the ‘mightiest passions of mankind’
      (Laws viii. 835 C), especially when they have been licensed by custom and religion? In
      addition to the influences of education, we seem to require some new
      principles of right and wrong in these matters, some force of opinion,
      which may indeed be already heard whispering in private, but has never
      affected the moral sentiments of mankind in general. We unavoidably lose
      sight of the principle of utility, just in that action of our lives in
      which we have the most need of it. The influences which we can bring to
      bear upon this question are chiefly indirect. In a generation or two,
      education, emigration, improvements in agriculture and manufactures, may
      have provided the solution. The state physician hardly likes to probe the
      wound: it is beyond his art; a matter which he cannot safely let alone,
      but which he dare not touch:

      When again in private life we see a whole family one by one dropping into
      the grave under the Ate of some inherited malady, and the parents perhaps
      surviving them, do our minds ever go back silently to that day twenty-five
      or thirty years before on which under the fairest auspices, amid the
      rejoicings of friends and acquaintances, a bride and bridegroom joined
      hands with one another? In making such a reflection we are not opposing
      physical considerations to moral, but moral to physical; we are seeking to
      make the voice of reason heard, which drives us back from the extravagance
      of sentimentalism on common sense. The late Dr. Combe is said by his
      biographer to have resisted the temptation to marriage, because he knew
      that he was subject to hereditary consumption. One who deserved to be
      called a man of genius, a friend of my youth, was in the habit of wearing
      a black ribbon on his wrist, in order to remind him that, being liable to
      outbreaks of insanity, he must not give way to the natural impulses of
      affection: he died unmarried in a <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxcii"></a>cxcii</span> lunatic asylum. These two little facts
      suggest the reflection that a very few persons have done from a sense of
      duty what the rest of mankind ought to have done under like circumstances,
      if they had allowed themselves to think of all the misery which they were
      about to bring into the world. If we could prevent such marriages without
      any violation of feeling or propriety, we clearly ought; and the
      prohibition in the course of time would be protected by a ‘horror
      naturalis’ similar to that which, in all civilized ages and countries, has
      prevented the marriage of near relations by blood. Mankind would have been
      the happier, if some things which are now allowed had from the beginning
      been denied to them; if the sanction of religion could have prohibited
      practices inimical to health; if sanitary principles could in early ages
      have been invested with a superstitious awe. But, living as we do far on
      in the world’s history, we are no longer able to stamp at once with the
      impress of religion a new prohibition. A free agent cannot have his
      fancies regulated by law; and the execution of the law would be rendered
      impossible, owing to the uncertainty of the cases in which marriage was to
      be forbidden. Who can weigh virtue, or even fortune against health, or
      moral and mental qualities against bodily? Who can measure probabilities
      against certainties? There has been some good as well as evil in the
      discipline of suffering; and there are diseases, such as consumption,
      which have exercised a refining and softening influence on the character.
      Youth is too inexperienced to balance such nice considerations; parents do
      not often think of them, or think of them too late. They are at a distance
      and may probably be averted; change of place, a new state of life, the
      interests of a home may be the cure of them. So persons vainly reason when
      their minds are already made up and their fortunes irrevocably linked
      together. Nor is there any ground for supposing that marriages are to any
      great extent influenced by reflections of this sort, which seem unable to
      make any head against the irresistible impulse of individual attachment.
    </p>
<p>
      Lastly, no one can have observed the first rising flood of the passions in
      youth, the difficulty of regulating them, and the effects on the whole
      mind and nature which follow from them, the stimulus which is given to
      them by the imagination, without feeling that there is something
      unsatisfactory in our method of <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxciii"></a>cxciii</span> treating them. That the most important
      influence on human life should be wholly left to chance or shrouded in
      mystery, and instead of being disciplined or understood, should be
      required to conform only to an external standard of propriety—cannot
      be regarded by the philosopher as a safe or satisfactory condition of
      human things. And still those who have the charge of youth may find a way
      by watchfulness, by affection, by the manliness and innocence of their own
      lives, by occasional hints, by general admonitions which every one can
      apply for himself, to mitigate this terrible evil which eats out the heart
      of individuals and corrupts the moral sentiments of nations. In no duty
      towards others is there more need of reticence and self-restraint. So
      great is the danger lest he who would be the counsellor of another should
      reveal the secret prematurely, lest he should get another too much into
      his power; or fix the passing impression of evil by demanding the
      confession of it.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor is Plato wrong in asserting that family attachments may interfere with
      higher aims. If there have been some who ‘to party gave up what was meant
      for mankind,’ there have certainly been others who to family gave up what
      was meant for mankind or for their country. The cares of children, the
      necessity of procuring money for their support, the flatteries of the rich
      by the poor, the exclusiveness of caste, the pride of birth or wealth, the
      tendency of family life to divert men from the pursuit of the ideal or the
      heroic, are as lowering in our own age as in that of Plato. And if we
      prefer to look at the gentle influences of home, the development of the
      affections, the amenities of society, the devotion of one member of a
      family for the good of the others, which form one side of the picture, we
      must not quarrel with him, or perhaps ought rather to be grateful to him,
      for having presented to us the reverse. Without attempting to defend Plato
      on grounds of morality, we may allow that there is an aspect of the world
      which has not unnaturally led him into error.
    </p>
<p>
      We hardly appreciate the power which the idea of the State, like all other
      abstract ideas, exercised over the mind of Plato. To us the State seems to
      be built up out of the family, or sometimes to be the framework in which
      family and social life is contained. But to Plato in his present mood of
      mind the family <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxciv"></a>cxciv</span> is only a disturbing influence which, instead of filling
      up, tends to disarrange the higher unity of the State. No organization is
      needed except a political, which, regarded from another point of view, is
      a military one. The State is all-sufficing for the wants of man, and, like
      the idea of the Church in later ages, absorbs all other desires and
      affections. In time of war the thousand citizens are to stand like a
      rampart impregnable against the world or the Persian host; in time of
      peace the preparation for war and their duties to the State, which are
      also their duties to one another, take up their whole life and time. The
      only other interest which is allowed to them besides that of war, is the
      interest of philosophy. When they are too old to be soldiers they are to
      retire from active life and to have a second novitiate of study and
      contemplation. There is an element of monasticism even in Plato’s
      communism. If he could have done without children, he might have converted
      his Republic into a religious order. Neither in the Laws (v. 739 B), when the
      daylight of common sense breaks in upon him, does he retract his error. In
      the state of which he would be the founder, there is no marrying or giving
      in marriage: but because of the infirmity of mankind, he condescends to
      allow the law of nature to prevail.
    </p>
<p id="inIIc">
      (<span class="transl" title="g">γ</span>) But Plato has an equal, or, in his own estimation, even greater
      paradox in reserve, which is summed up in the famous text, ‘Until kings
      are philosophers or philosophers are kings, cities will never cease from
      ill.’ And by philosophers he explains himself to mean those who are
      capable of apprehending ideas, especially the idea of good. To the
      attainment of this higher knowledge the second education is directed.
      Through a process of training which has already made them good citizens
      they are now to be made good legislators. We find with some surprise (not
      unlike the feeling which Aristotle in a well-known passage describes the
      hearers of Plato’s lectures as experiencing, when they went to a discourse
      on the idea of good, expecting to be instructed in moral truths, and
      received instead of them arithmetical and mathematical formulae) that
      Plato does not propose for his future legislators any study of finance or
      law or military tactics, but only of abstract mathematics, as a
      preparation for the still more abstract conception of good. We ask, with
      Aristotle, What is the use of a man knowing the idea of <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxcv"></a>cxcv</span> good, if he does
      not know what is good for this individual, this state, this condition of
      society? We cannot understand how Plato’s legislators or guardians are to
      be fitted for their work of statesmen by the study of the five
      mathematical sciences. We vainly search in Plato’s own writings for any
      explanation of this seeming absurdity.
    </p>
<p>
      The discovery of a great metaphysical conception seems to ravish the mind
      with a prophetic consciousness which takes away the power of estimating
      its value. No metaphysical enquirer has ever fairly criticised his own
      speculations; in his own judgment they have been above criticism; nor has
      he understood that what to him seemed to be absolute truth may reappear in
      the next generation as a form of logic or an instrument of thought. And
      posterity have also sometimes equally misapprehended the real value of his
      speculations. They appear to them to have contributed nothing to the stock
      of human knowledge. The <em>idea</em> of good is apt to be regarded by the modern
      thinker as an unmeaning abstraction; but he forgets that this abstraction
      is waiting ready for use, and will hereafter be filled up by the divisions
      of knowledge. When mankind do not as yet know that the world is subject to
      law, the introduction of the mere conception of law or design or final
      cause, and the far-off anticipation of the harmony of knowledge, are great
      steps onward. Even the crude generalization of the unity of all things
      leads men to view the world with different eyes, and may easily affect
      their conception of human life and of politics, and also their own conduct
      and character (Tim. 90 A). We can imagine how a great mind like that of Pericles
      might derive elevation from his intercourse with Anaxagoras (Phaedr. 270 A). To
      be struggling towards a higher but unattainable conception is a more
      favourable intellectual condition than to rest satisfied in a narrow
      portion of ascertained fact. And the earlier, which have sometimes been
      the greater ideas of science, are often lost sight of at a later period.
      How rarely can we say of any modern enquirer in the magnificent language
      of Plato, that ‘He is the spectator of all time and of all existence!’
    </p>
<p>
      Nor is there anything unnatural in the hasty application of these vast
      metaphysical conceptions to practical and political life. In the first
      enthusiasm of ideas men are apt to see them <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxcvi"></a>cxcvi</span> everywhere, and to apply them
      in the most remote sphere. They do not understand that the experience of
      ages is required to enable them to fill up ‘the intermediate axioms.’
      Plato himself seems to have imagined that the truths of psychology, like
      those of astronomy and harmonics, would be arrived at by a process of
      deduction, and that the method which he has pursued in the Fourth Book, of
      inferring them from experience and the use of language, was imperfect and
      only provisional. But when, after having arrived at the idea of good,
      which is the end of the science of dialectic, he is asked, What is the
      nature, and what are the divisions of the science? He refuses to answer,
      as if intending by the refusal to intimate that the state of knowledge
      which then existed was not such as would allow the philosopher to enter
      into his final rest. The previous sciences must first be studied, and
      will, we may add, continue to be studied tell the end of time, although in
      a sense different from any which Plato could have conceived. But we may
      observe, that while he is aware of the vacancy of his own ideal, he is
      full of enthusiasm in the contemplation of it. Looking into the orb of
      light, he sees nothing, but he is warmed and elevated. The Hebrew prophet
      believed that faith in God would enable him to govern the world; the Greek
      philosopher imagined that contemplation of the good would make a
      legislator. There is as much to be filled up in the one case as in the
      other, and the one mode of conception is to the Israelite what the other
      is to the Greek. Both find a repose in a divine perfection, which, whether
      in a more personal or impersonal form, exists without them and
      independently of them, as well as within them.
    </p>
<p>
      There is no mention of the idea of good in the Timaeus, nor of the divine
      Creator of the world in the Republic; and we are naturally led to ask in
      what relation they stand to one another. Is God above or below the idea of
      good? Or is the Idea of Good another mode of conceiving God? The latter
      appears to be the truer answer. To the Greek philosopher the perfection
      and unity of God was a far higher conception than his personality, which
      he hardly found a word to express, and which to him would have seemed to
      be borrowed from mythology. To the Christian, on the other hand, or to the
      modern thinker in <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxcvii"></a>cxcvii</span> general, it is difficult, if not impossible, to attach
      reality to what he terms mere abstraction; while to Plato this very
      abstraction is the truest and most real of all things. Hence, from a
      difference in forms of thought, Plato appears to be resting on a creation
      of his own mind only. But if we may be allowed to paraphrase the idea of
      good by the words ‘intelligent principle of law and order in the universe,
      embracing equally man and nature,’ we begin to find a meeting-point
      between him and ourselves.
    </p>
<p>
      The question whether the ruler or statesman should be a philosopher is one
      that has not lost interest in modern times. In most countries of Europe
      and Asia there has been some one in the course of ages who has truly
      united the power of command with the power of thought and reflection, as
      there have been also many false combinations of these qualities. Some kind
      of speculative power is necessary both in practical and political life;
      like the rhetorician in the Phaedrus, men require to have a conception of
      the varieties of human character, and to be raised on great occasions
      above the commonplaces of ordinary life. Yet the idea of the
      philosopher-statesman has never been popular with the mass of mankind;
      partly because he cannot take the world into his confidence or make them
      understand the motives from which he acts; and also because they are
      jealous of a power which they do not understand. The revolution which
      human nature desires to effect step by step in many ages is likely to be
      precipitated by him in a single year or life. They are afraid that in the
      pursuit of his greater aims he may disregard the common feelings of
      humanity, he is too apt to be looking into the distant future or back into
      the remote past, and unable to see actions or events which, to use an
      expression of Plato’s ‘are tumbling out at his feet.’ Besides, as Plato
      would say, there are other corruptions of these philosophical statesmen.
      Either ‘the native hue of resolution is sicklied o’er with the pale cast
      of thought,’ and at the moment when action above all things is required he
      is undecided, or general principles are enunciated by him in order to
      cover some change of policy; or his ignorance of the world has made him
      more easily fall a prey to the arts of others; or in some cases he has
      been converted into a courtier, who enjoys <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxcviii"></a>cxcviii</span> the luxury of holding liberal
      opinions, but was never known to perform a liberal action. No wonder that
      mankind have been in the habit of calling statesmen of this class pedants,
      sophisters, doctrinaires, visionaries. For, as we may be allowed to say, a
      little parodying the words of Plato, ‘they have seen bad imitations of the
      philosopher-statesman.’ But a man in whom the power of thought and action
      are perfectly balanced, equal to the present, reaching forward to the
      future, ‘such a one,’ ruling in a constitutional state, ‘they have never
      seen.’
    </p>
<p>
      But as the philosopher is apt to fail in the routine of political life, so
      the ordinary statesman is also apt to fail in extraordinary crises. When
      the face of the world is beginning to alter, and thunder is heard in the
      distance, he is still guided by his old maxims, and is the slave of his
      inveterate party prejudices; he cannot perceive the signs of the times;
      instead of looking forward he looks back; he learns nothing and forgets
      nothing; with ‘wise saws and modern instances’ he would stem the rising
      tide of revolution. He lives more and more within the circle of his own
      party, as the world without him becomes stronger. This seems to be the
      reason why the old order of things makes so poor a figure when confronted
      with the new, why churches can never reform, why most political changes
      are made blindly and convulsively. The great crises in the history of
      nations have often been met by an ecclesiastical positiveness, and a more
      obstinate reassertion of principles which have lost their hold upon a
      nation. The fixed ideas of a reactionary statesman may be compared to
      madness; they grow upon him, and he becomes possessed by them; no
      judgement of others is ever admitted by him to be weighed in the balance
      against his own.
    </p>
<p id="inIId">
      (<span class="transl" title="d">δ</span>) Plato, labouring under what, to modern readers, appears to have been a
      confusion of ideas, assimilates the state to the individual, and fails to
      distinguish Ethics from Politics. He thinks that to be most of a state
      which is most like one man, and in which the citizens have the greatest
      uniformity of character. He does not see that the analogy is partly
      fallacious, and that the will or character of a state or nation is really
      the balance or rather the surplus of individual wills, which are limited
      by the condition of having to act in common. <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecxcix"></a>cxcix</span> The movement of a body of men
      can never have the pliancy or facility of a single man; the freedom of the
      individual, which is always limited, becomes still more straitened when
      transferred to a nation. The powers of action and feeling are necessarily
      weaker and more balanced when they are diffused through a community;
      whence arises the often discussed question, ‘Can a nation, like an
      individual, have a conscience?’ We hesitate to say that the characters of
      nations are nothing more than the sum of the characters of the individuals
      who compose them; because there may be tendencies in individuals which
      react upon one another. A whole nation may be wiser than any one man in
      it; or may be animated by some common opinion or feeling which could not
      equally have affected the mind of a single person, or may have been
      inspired by a leader of genius to perform acts more than human. Plato does
      not appear to have analysed the complications which arise out of the
      collective action of mankind. Neither is he capable of seeing that
      analogies, though specious as arguments, may often have no foundation in
      fact, or of distinguishing between what is intelligible or vividly present
      to the mind, and what is true. In this respect he is far below Aristotle,
      who is comparatively seldom imposed upon by false analogies. He cannot
      disentangle the arts from the virtues—at least he is always arguing
      from one to the other. His notion of music is transferred from harmony of
      sounds to harmony of life: in this he is assisted by the ambiguities of
      language as well as by the prevalence of Pythagorean notions. And having
      once assimilated the state to the individual, he imagines that he will
      find the succession of states paralleled in the lives of individuals.
    </p>
<p>
      Still, through this fallacious medium, a real enlargement of ideas is
      attained. When the virtues as yet presented no distinct conception to the
      mind, a great advance was made by the comparison of them with the arts;
      for virtue is partly art, and has an outward form as well as an inward
      principle. The harmony of music affords a lively image of the harmonies of
      the world and of human life, and may be regarded as a splendid
      illustration which was naturally mistaken for a real analogy. In the same
      way the identification of ethics with politics has a tendency to give
      definiteness to ethics, and also to elevate and ennoble men’s <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecc"></a>cc</span> notions of
      the aims of government and of the duties of citizens; for ethics from one
      point of view may be conceived as an idealized law and politics; and
      politics, as ethics reduced to the conditions of human society. There have
      been evils which have arisen out of the attempt to identify them, and this
      has led to the separation or antagonism of them, which has been introduced
      by modern political writers. But we may likewise feel that something has
      been lost in their separation, and that the ancient philosophers who
      estimated the moral and intellectual wellbeing of mankind first, and the
      wealth of nations and individuals second, may have a salutary influence on
      the speculations of modern times. Many political maxims originate in a
      reaction against an opposite error; and when the errors against which they
      were directed have passed away, they in turn become errors.
    </p>
<p> </p>
<p id="inIII">
      III. Plato’s views of education are in several respects remarkable; like the
      rest of the Republic they are partly Greek and partly ideal, beginning
      with the ordinary curriculum of the Greek youth, and extending to
      after-life. Plato is the first writer who distinctly says that education
      is to comprehend the whole of life, and to be a preparation for another in
      which education begins again (vi. <a href="#stpage498D" class="pginternal">498 D</a>). This is the continuous thread which runs
      through the Republic, and which more than any other of his ideas admits of
      an application to modern life.
    </p>
<p>
      He has long given up the notion that virtue cannot be taught; and he is
      disposed to modify the thesis of the Protagoras, that the virtues are one
      and not many. He is not unwilling to admit the sensible world into his
      scheme of truth. Nor does he assert in the Republic the involuntariness of
      vice, which is maintained by him in the Timaeus, Sophist, and Laws
      (cp. Protag. 345 foll., 352, 355; Apol. 25 E; Gorg. 468, 509 E). Nor do the so-called Platonic ideas recovered
      from a former state of existence affect his theory of mental improvement.
      Still we observe in him the remains of the old Socratic doctrine, that
      true knowledge must be elicited from within, and is to be sought for in
      ideas, not in particulars of sense. Education, as he says, will implant a
      principle of intelligence which is better than ten <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecci"></a>cci</span> thousand eyes. The
      paradox that the virtues are one, and the kindred notion that all virtue
      is knowledge, are not entirely renounced; the first is seen in the
      supremacy given to justice over the rest; the second in the tendency to
      absorb the moral virtues in the intellectual, and to centre all goodness
      in the contemplation of the idea of good. The world of sense is still
      depreciated and identified with opinion, though admitted to be a shadow of
      the true. In the Republic he is evidently impressed with the conviction
      that vice arises chiefly from ignorance and may be cured by education; the
      multitude are hardly to be deemed responsible for what they do (v. <a href="#stpage499E" class="pginternal">499 E</a>). A faint
      allusion to the doctrine of reminiscence occurs in the Tenth Book (<a href="#stpage621A" class="pginternal">621 A</a>); but
      Plato’s views of education have no more real connection with a previous
      state of existence than our own; he only proposes to elicit from the mind
      that which is there already. Education is represented by him, not as the
      filling of a vessel, but as the turning the eye of the soul towards the
      light.
    </p>
<p>
      He treats first of music or literature, which he divides into true and
      false, and then goes on to gymnastics; of infancy in the Republic he takes
      no notice, though in the Laws he gives sage counsels about the nursing of
      children and the management of the mothers, and would have an education
      which is even prior to birth. But in the Republic he begins with the age
      at which the child is capable of receiving ideas, and boldly asserts, in
      language which sounds paradoxical to modern ears, that he must be taught
      the false before he can learn the true. The modern and ancient
      philosophical world are not agreed about truth and falsehood; the one
      identifies truth almost exclusively with fact, the other with ideas. This
      is the difference between ourselves and Plato, which is, however, partly a
      difference of words (cp. supra, <a href="#pagexxxviii" class="pginternal">p. xxxviii</a>). For we too should admit that a child must receive
      many lessons which he imperfectly understands; he must be taught some
      things in a figure only, some too which he can hardly be expected to
      believe when he grows older; but we should limit the use of fiction by the
      necessity of the case. Plato would draw the line differently; according to
      him the aim of early education is not truth as a matter of fact, but truth
      as a matter of principle; the child is to be taught first simple religious
      truths, and then simple moral truths, and insensibly to learn the lesson
      of good manners and good taste. He <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccii"></a>ccii</span> would make an entire reformation of the
      old mythology; like Xenophanes and Heracleitus he is sensible of the deep
      chasm which separates his own age from Homer and Hesiod, whom he quotes
      and invests with an imaginary authority, but only for his own purposes.
      The lusts and treacheries of the gods are to be banished; the terrors of
      the world below are to be dispelled; the misbehaviour of the Homeric
      heroes is not to be a model for youth. But there is another strain heard
      in Homer which may teach our youth endurance; and something may be learnt
      in medicine from the simple practice of the Homeric age. The principles on
      which religion is to be based are two only: first, that God is true;
      secondly, that he is good. Modern and Christian writers have often fallen
      short of these; they can hardly be said to have gone beyond them.
    </p>
<p>
      The young are to be brought up in happy surroundings, out of the way of
      sights or sounds which may hurt the character or vitiate the taste. They
      are to live in an atmosphere of health; the breeze is always to be wafting
      to them the impressions of truth and goodness. Could such an education be
      realized, or if our modern religious education could be bound up with
      truth and virtue and good manners and good taste, that would be the best
      hope of human improvement. Plato, like ourselves, is looking forward to
      changes in the moral and religious world, and is preparing for them. He
      recognizes the danger of unsettling young men’s minds by sudden changes of
      laws and principles, by destroying the sacredness of one set of ideas when
      there is nothing else to take their place. He is afraid too of the
      influence of the drama, on the ground that it encourages false sentiment,
      and therefore he would not have his children taken to the theatre; he
      thinks that the effect on the spectators is bad, and on the actors still
      worse. His idea of education is that of harmonious growth, in which are
      insensibly learnt the lessons of temperance and endurance, and the body
      and mind develope in equal proportions. The first principle which runs
      through all art and nature is simplicity; this also is to be the rule of
      human life.
    </p>
<p>
      The second stage of education is gymnastic, which answers to the period of
      muscular growth and development. The simplicity which is enforced in music
      is extended to gymnastic; Plato is aware that the <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecciii"></a>cciii</span> training of the body may
      be inconsistent with the training of the mind, and that bodily exercise
      may be easily overdone. Excessive training of the body is apt to give men
      a headache or to render them sleepy at a lecture on philosophy, and this
      they attribute not to the true cause, but to the nature of the subject.
      Two points are noticeable in Plato’s treatment of gymnastic:—First,
      that the time of training is entirely separated from the time of literary
      education. He seems to have thought that two things of an opposite and
      different nature could not be learnt at the same time. Here we can hardly
      agree with him; and, if we may judge by experience, the effect of spending
      three years between the ages of fourteen and seventeen in mere bodily
      exercise would be far from improving to the intellect. Secondly, he
      affirms that music and gymnastic are not, as common opinion is apt to
      imagine, intended, the one for the cultivation of the mind and the other
      of the body, but that they are both equally designed for the improvement
      of the mind. The body, in his view, is the servant of the mind; the
      subjection of the lower to the higher is for the advantage of both. And
      doubtless the mind may exercise a very great and paramount influence over
      the body, if exerted not at particular moments and by fits and starts, but
      continuously, in making preparation for the whole of life. Other Greek
      writers saw the mischievous tendency of Spartan discipline (Arist. Pol. viii. 4, § 1 foll.; Thuc. ii. 37, 39). But only Plato recognized the fundamental error on which the
      practice was based.
    </p>
<p>
      The subject of gymnastic leads Plato to the sister subject of medicine,
      which he further illustrates by the parallel of law. The modern disbelief
      in medicine has led in this, as in some other departments of knowledge, to
      a demand for greater simplicity; physicians are becoming aware that they
      often make diseases ‘greater and more complicated’ by their treatment of
      them (Rep. iv. <a href="#stpage426A" class="pginternal">426 A</a>). In two thousand years their art has made but slender
      progress; what they have gained in the analysis of the parts is in a great
      degree lost by their feebler conception of the human frame as a whole.
      They have attended more to the cure of diseases than to the conditions of
      health; and the improvements in medicine have been more than
      counterbalanced by the disuse of regular training. Until lately they have
      hardly thought of air and water, the importance of which was well
      understood by the ancients; as Aristotle remarks, ‘Air and water, being
      the elements <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagecciv"></a>cciv</span> which we most use, have the greatest effect upon health’
      (Polit. vii. 11, § 4). For ages physicians have been under the dominion of prejudices
      which have only recently given way; and now there are as many opinions in
      medicine as in theology, and an equal degree of scepticism and some want
      of toleration about both. Plato has several good notions about medicine;
      according to him, ‘the eye cannot be cured without the rest of the body,
      nor the body without the mind’ (Charm. 156 E). No man of sense, he says in the
      Timaeus, would take physic; and we heartily sympathize with him in the
      Laws when he declares that ‘the limbs of the rustic worn with toil will
      derive more benefit from warm baths than from the prescriptions of a not
      over wise doctor’ (vi. 761 C). But we can hardly praise him when, in obedience to the
      authority of Homer, he depreciates diet, or approve of the inhuman spirit
      in which he would get rid of invalid and useless lives by leaving them to
      die. He does not seem to have considered that the ‘bridle of Theages’
      might be accompanied by qualities which were of far more value to the
      State than the health or strength of the citizens; or that the duty of
      taking care of the helpless might be an important element of education in
      a State. The physician himself (this is a delicate and subtle observation)
      should not be a man in robust health; he should have, in modern
      phraseology, a nervous temperament; he should have experience of disease
      in his own person, in order that his powers of observation may be
      quickened in the case of others.
    </p>
<p>
      The perplexity of medicine is paralleled by the perplexity of law; in
      which, again, Plato would have men follow the golden rule of simplicity.
      Greater matters are to be determined by the legislator or by the oracle of
      Delphi, lesser matters are to be left to the temporary regulation of the
      citizens themselves. Plato is aware that <i>laissez faire</i> is an important
      element of government. The diseases of a State are like the heads of a
      hydra; they multiply when they are cut off. The true remedy for them is
      not extirpation but prevention. And the way to prevent them is to take
      care of education, and education will take care of all the rest. So in
      modern times men have often felt that the only political measure worth
      having—the only one which would produce any certain or lasting
      effect, was a measure of national education. And in our own more than in
      any previous age the necessity has been <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccv"></a>ccv</span> recognized of restoring the
      ever-increasing confusion of law to simplicity and common sense.
    </p>
<p>
      When the training in music and gymnastic is completed, there follows the
      first stage of active and public life. But soon education is to begin
      again from a new point of view. In the interval between the Fourth and
      Seventh Books we have discussed the nature of knowledge, and have thence
      been led to form a higher conception of what was required of us. For true
      knowledge, according to Plato, is of abstractions, and has to do, not with
      particulars or individuals, but with universals only; not with the
      beauties of poetry, but with the ideas of philosophy. And the great aim of
      education is the cultivation of the habit of abstraction. This is to be
      acquired through the study of the mathematical sciences. They alone are
      capable of giving ideas of relation, and of arousing the dormant energies
      of thought.
    </p>
<p>
      Mathematics in the age of Plato comprehended a very small part of that
      which is now included in them; but they bore a much larger proportion to
      the sum of human knowledge. They were the only organon of thought which
      the human mind at that time possessed, and the only measure by which the
      chaos of particulars could be reduced to rule and order. The faculty which
      they trained was naturally at war with the poetical or imaginative; and
      hence to Plato, who is everywhere seeking for abstractions and trying to
      get rid of the illusions of sense, nearly the whole of education is
      contained in them. They seemed to have an inexhaustible application,
      partly because their true limits were not yet understood. These Plato
      himself is beginning to investigate; though not aware that number and
      figure are mere abstractions of sense, he recognizes that the forms used
      by geometry are borrowed from the sensible world (vi. <a href="#stpage510A" class="pginternal">510</a>, <a href="#stpage511A" class="pginternal">511</a>). He seeks to find the
      ultimate ground of mathematical ideas in the idea of good, though he does
      not satisfactorily explain the connexion between them; and in his
      conception of the relation of ideas to numbers, he falls very far short of
      the definiteness attributed to him by Aristotle (Met. i. 8, § 24; ix. 17). But if he fails to
      recognize the true limits of mathematics, he also reaches a point beyond
      them; in his view, ideas of number become secondary to a higher conception
      of knowledge. The dialectician is as much above the mathematician as the
      mathematician is above the ordinary man (cp. vii. <a href="#stpage526D" class="pginternal">526 D</a>, <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccvi"></a>ccvi</span> <a href="#stpage531E" class="pginternal">531 E</a>). The one, the self-proving, the
      good which is the higher sphere of dialectic, is the perfect truth to
      which all things ascend, and in which they finally repose.
    </p>
<p>
      This self-proving unity or idea of good is a mere vision of which no
      distinct explanation can be given, relative only to a particular stage in
      Greek philosophy. It is an abstraction under which no individuals are
      comprehended, a whole which has no parts (cf. Arist., Nic. Eth., i. 4). The vacancy
      of such a form was perceived by Aristotle, but not by Plato. Nor did he
      recognize that in the dialectical process are included two or more methods
      of investigation which are at variance with each other. He did not see
      that whether he took the longer or the shorter road, no advance could be
      made in this way. And yet such visions often have an immense effect; for
      although the method of science cannot anticipate science, the idea of
      science, not as it is, but as it will be in the future, is a great and
      inspiring principle. In the pursuit of knowledge we are always pressing
      forward to something beyond us; and as a false conception of knowledge,
      for example the scholastic philosophy, may lead men astray during many
      ages, so the true ideal, though vacant, may draw all their thoughts in a
      right direction. It makes a great difference whether the general
      expectation of knowledge, as this indefinite feeling may be termed, is
      based upon a sound judgment. For mankind may often entertain a true
      conception of what knowledge ought to be when they have but a slender
      experience of facts. The correlation of the sciences, the consciousness of
      the unity of nature, the idea of classification, the sense of proportion,
      the unwillingness to stop short of certainty or to confound probability
      with truth, are important principles of the higher education. Although
      Plato could tell us nothing, and perhaps knew that he could tell us
      nothing, of the absolute truth, he has exercised an influence on the human
      mind which even at the present day is not exhausted; and political and
      social questions may yet arise in which the thoughts of Plato may be read
      anew and receive a fresh meaning.
    </p>
<p>
      The Idea of good is so called only in the Republic, but there are traces
      of it in other dialogues of Plato. It is a cause as well as an idea, and
      from this point of view may be compared with the creator of the Timaeus,
      who out of his goodness created <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccvii"></a>ccvii</span> all things. It corresponds to a certain
      extent with the modern conception of a law of nature, or of a final cause,
      or of both in one, and in this regard may be connected with the measure
      and symmetry of the Philebus. It is represented in the Symposium under the
      aspect of beauty, and is supposed to be attained there by stages of
      initiation, as here by regular gradations of knowledge. Viewed
      subjectively, it is the process or science of dialectic. This is the
      science which, according to the Phaedrus, is the true basis of rhetoric,
      which alone is able to distinguish the natures and classes of men and
      things; which divides a whole into the natural parts, and reunites the
      scattered parts into a natural or organized whole; which defines the
      abstract essences or universal ideas of all things, and connects them;
      which pierces the veil of hypotheses and reaches the final cause or first
      principle of all; which regards the sciences in relation to the idea of
      good. This ideal science is the highest process of thought, and may be
      described as the soul conversing with herself or holding communion with
      eternal truth and beauty, and in another form is the everlasting question
      and answer—the ceaseless interrogative of Socrates. The dialogues of
      Plato are themselves examples of the nature and method of dialectic.
      Viewed objectively, the idea of good is a power or cause which makes the
      world without us correspond with the world within. Yet this world without
      us is still a world of ideas. With Plato the investigation of nature is
      another department of knowledge, and in this he seeks to attain only
      probable conclusions (cp. Timaeus, 44 D).
    </p>
<p>
      If we ask whether this science of dialectic which Plato only half explains
      to us is more akin to logic or to metaphysics, the answer is that in his
      mind the two sciences are not as yet distinguished, any more than the
      subjective and objective aspects of the world and of man, which German
      philosophy has revealed to us. Nor has he determined whether his science
      of dialectic is at rest or in motion, concerned with the contemplation of
      absolute being, or with a process of development and evolution. Modern
      metaphysics may be described as the science of abstractions, or as the
      science of the evolution of thought; modern logic, when passing beyond the
      bounds of mere Aristotelian forms, may be defined as the science of
      method. The germ of <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccviii"></a>ccviii</span> both of them is contained in the Platonic dialectic;
      all metaphysicians have something in common with the ideas of Plato; all
      logicians have derived something from the method of Plato. The nearest
      approach in modern philosophy to the universal science of Plato, is to be
      found in the Hegelian ‘succession of moments in the unity of the idea.’
      Plato and Hegel alike seem to have conceived the world as the correlation
      of abstractions; and not impossibly they would have understood one another
      better than any of their commentators understand them (cp. Swift’s Voyage to
      Laputa, c. 8<a href="#Footnoteintro4" id="FnAnchorintro4" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">4</span></a>). There is, however, a difference between them: for
      whereas Hegel is thinking of all the minds of men as one mind, which
      developes the stages of the idea in different countries or at different
      times in the same country, with Plato these gradations are regarded only
      as an order of thought or ideas; the history of the human mind had not yet
      dawned upon him.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnoteintro4"></a><a href="#FnAnchorintro4" class="pginternal">4</a></span> ‘Having a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for
      wit and learning, I set apart one day on purpose. I proposed that Homer
      and Aristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators; but
      these were so numerous that some hundreds were forced to attend in the
      court and outward rooms of the palace. I knew, and could distinguish these
      two heroes, at first sight, not only from the crowd, but from each other.
      Homer was the taller and comelier person of the two, walked very erect for
      one of his age, and his eyes were the most quick and piercing I ever
      beheld. Aristotle stooped much, and made use of a staff. His visage was
      meagre, his hair lank and thin, and his voice hollow. I soon discovered
      that both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company, and
      had never seen or heard of them before. And I had a whisper from a ghost,
      who shall be nameless, “That these commentators always kept in the most
      distant quarters from their principals, in the lower world, through a
      consciousness of shame and guilt, because they had so horribly
      misrepresented the meaning of these authors to posterity.” I introduced
      Didymus and Eustathius to Homer, and prevailed on him to treat them better
      than perhaps they deserved, for he soon found they wanted a genius to
      enter into the spirit of a poet. But Aristotle was out of all patience
      with the account I gave him of Scotus and Ramus, as I presented them to
      him; and he asked them “whether the rest of the tribe were as great dunces
      as themselves?”’</p></div>
<p>
      Many criticisms may be made on Plato’s theory of education. While in some
      respects he unavoidably falls short of modern thinkers, in others he is in
      advance of them. He is opposed to the modes of education which prevailed
      in his own time; but he can hardly be said to have discovered new ones. He
      does <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccix"></a>ccix</span> not see that education is relative to the characters of individuals;
      he only desires to impress the same form of the state on the minds of all.
      He has no sufficient idea of the effect of literature on the formation of
      the mind, and greatly exaggerates that of mathematics. His aim is above
      all things to train the reasoning faculties; to implant in the mind the
      spirit and power of abstraction; to explain and define general notions,
      and, if possible, to connect them. No wonder that in the vacancy of actual
      knowledge his followers, and at times even he himself, should have fallen
      away from the doctrine of ideas, and have returned to that branch of
      knowledge in which alone the relation of the one and many can be truly
      seen—the science of number. In his views both of teaching and
      training he might be styled, in modern language, a doctrinaire; after the
      Spartan fashion he would have his citizens cast in one mould; he does not
      seem to consider that some degree of freedom, ‘a little wholesome
      neglect,’ is necessary to strengthen and develope the character and to
      give play to the individual nature. His citizens would not have acquired
      that knowledge which in the vision of Er is supposed to be gained by the
      pilgrims from their experience of evil.
    </p>
<p>
      On the other hand, Plato is far in advance of modern philosophers and
      theologians when he teaches that education is to be continued through life
      and will begin again in another. He would never allow education of some
      kind to cease; although he was aware that the proverbial saying of Solon,
      ‘I grow old learning many things,’ cannot be applied literally. Himself
      ravished with the contemplation of the idea of good, and delighting in
      solid geometry (Rep. vii. <a href="#stpage528A" class="pginternal">528</a>), he has no difficulty in imagining that a lifetime
      might be passed happily in such pursuits. We who know how many more men of
      business there are in the world than real students or thinkers, are not
      equally sanguine. The education which he proposes for his citizens is
      really the ideal life of the philosopher or man of genius, interrupted,
      but only for a time, by practical duties,—a life not for the many,
      but for the few.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet the thought of Plato may not be wholly incapable of application to our
      own times. Even if regarded as an ideal which can never be realized, it
      may have a great effect in elevating the characters of mankind, and
      raising them above the routine <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccx"></a>ccx</span> of their ordinary occupation or profession.
      It is the best form under which we can conceive the whole of life.
      Nevertheless the idea of Plato is not easily put into practice. For the
      education of after life is necessarily the education which each one gives
      himself. Men and women cannot be brought together in schools or colleges
      at forty or fifty years of age; and if they could the result would be
      disappointing. The destination of most men is what Plato would call ‘the
      Den’ for the whole of life, and with that they are content. Neither have
      they teachers or advisers with whom they can take counsel in riper years.
      There is no ‘schoolmaster abroad’ who will tell them of their faults, or
      inspire them with the higher sense of duty, or with the ambition of a true
      success in life; no Socrates who will convict them of ignorance; no
      Christ, or follower of Christ, who will reprove them of sin. Hence they
      have a difficulty in receiving the first element of improvement, which is
      self-knowledge. The hopes of youth no longer stir them; they rather wish
      to rest than to pursue high objects. A few only who have come across great
      men and women, or eminent teachers of religion and morality, have received
      a second life from them, and have lighted a candle from the fire of their
      genius.
    </p>
<p>
      The want of energy is one of the main reasons why so few persons continue
      to improve in later years. They have not the will, and do not know the
      way. They ‘never try an experiment,’ or look up a point of interest for
      themselves; they make no sacrifices for the sake of knowledge; their
      minds, like their bodies, at a certain age become fixed. Genius has been
      defined as ‘the power of taking pains’; but hardly any one keeps up his
      interest in knowledge throughout a whole life. The troubles of a family,
      the business of making money, the demands of a profession destroy the
      elasticity of the mind. The waxen tablet of the memory which was once
      capable of receiving ‘true thoughts and clear impressions’ becomes hard
      and crowded; there is not room for the accumulations of a long life
      (Theaet. 194 ff.). The student, as years advance, rather makes an exchange of
      knowledge than adds to his stores. There is no pressing necessity to
      learn; the stock of Classics or History or Natural Science which was
      enough for a man at twenty-five is enough for him at fifty. Neither is it
      easy to give a definite answer to any one who asks how he is to improve.
      For self-education consists in a <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxi"></a>ccxi</span> thousand things, commonplace in
      themselves,—in adding to what we are by nature something of what we
      are not; in learning to see ourselves as others see us; in judging, not by
      opinion, but by the evidence of facts; in seeking out the society of
      superior minds; in a study of lives and writings of great men; in
      observation of the world and character; in receiving kindly the natural
      influence of different times of life; in any act or thought which is
      raised above the practice or opinions of mankind; in the pursuit of some
      new or original enquiry; in any effort of mind which calls forth some
      latent power.

      If any one is desirous of carrying out in detail the Platonic education of
      after-life, some such counsels as the following may be offered to him:—That
      he shall choose the branch of knowledge to which his own mind most
      distinctly inclines, and in which he takes the greatest delight, either
      one which seems to connect with his own daily employment, or, perhaps,
      furnishes the greatest contrast to it. He may study from the speculative
      side the profession or business in which he is practically engaged. He may
      make Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Plato, Bacon the friends and companions of
      his life. He may find opportunities of hearing the living voice of a great
      teacher. He may select for enquiry some point of history or some
      unexplained phenomenon of nature. An hour a day passed in such scientific
      or literary pursuits will furnish as many facts as the memory can retain,
      and will give him ‘a pleasure not to be repented of’ (Timaeus, 59 D). Only let
      him beware of being the slave of crotchets, or of running after a Will o’
      the Wisp in his ignorance, or in his vanity of attributing to himself the
      gifts of a poet or assuming the air of a philosopher. He should know the
      limits of his own powers. Better to build up the mind by slow additions,
      to creep on quietly from one thing to another, to gain insensibly new
      powers and new interests in knowledge, than to form vast schemes which are
      never destined to be realized. But perhaps, as Plato would say, ‘This is
      part of another subject’ (Tim. 87 B); though we may also defend our digression
      by his example (Theaet. 72, 77).

      IV. We remark with surprise that the progress of nations or <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxii"></a>ccxii</span> the natural
      growth of institutions which fill modern treatises on political philosophy
      seem hardly ever to have attracted the attention of Plato and Aristotle.
      The ancients were familiar with the mutability of human affairs; they
      could moralize over the ruins of cities and the fall of empires (cp. Plato, Statesman 301, 302, and Sulpicius’ Letter to Cicero, Ad Fam. iv. 5); by them fate and chance were
      deemed to be real powers, almost persons, and to have had a great share in
      political events. The wiser of them like Thucydides believed that ‘what
      had been would be again,’ and that a tolerable idea of the future could be
      gathered from the past. Also they had dreams of a Golden Age which existed
      once upon a time and might still exist in some unknown land, or might
      return again in the remote future. But the regular growth of a state
      enlightened by experience, progressing in knowledge, improving in the
      arts, of which the citizens were educated by the fulfilment of political
      duties, appears never to have come within the range of their hopes and
      aspirations. Such a state had never been seen, and therefore could not be
      conceived by them. Their experience (cp. Aristot. Metaph. xi. 21; Plato, Laws iii. 676–9) led
      them to conclude that there had been cycles of civilization in which the
      arts had been discovered and lost many times over, and cities had been
      overthrown and rebuilt again and again, and deluges and volcanoes and
      other natural convulsions had altered the face of the earth. Tradition
      told them of many destructions of mankind and of the preservation of a
      remnant. The world began again after a deluge and was reconstructed out of
      the fragments of itself. Also they were acquainted with empires of unknown
      antiquity, like the Egyptian or Assyrian; but they had never seen them
      grow, and could not imagine, any more than we can, the state of man which
      preceded them. They were puzzled and awestricken by the Egyptian
      monuments, of which the forms, as Plato says, not in a figure, but
      literally, were ten thousand years old (Laws ii. 656 E), and they contrasted the
      antiquity of Egypt with their own short memories.
    </p>
<p>
      The early legends of Hellas have no real connection with the later
      history: they are at a distance, and the intermediate region is concealed
      from view; there is no road or path which leads from one to the other. At
      the beginning of Greek history, in the vestibule of the temple, is seen
      standing first of all the figure of <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxiii"></a>ccxiii</span> the legislator, himself the
      interpreter and servant of the God. The fundamental laws which he gives
      are not supposed to change with time and circumstances. The salvation of
      the state is held rather to depend on the inviolable maintenance of them.
      They were sanctioned by the authority of heaven, and it was deemed impiety
      to alter them. The desire to maintain them unaltered seems to be the
      origin of what at first sight is very surprising to us—the
      intolerant zeal of Plato against innovators in religion or politics
      (cp. Laws x. 907–9); although with a happy inconsistency he is also willing that the
      laws of other countries should be studied and improvements in legislation
      privately communicated to the Nocturnal Council (Laws xii. 951, 2). The additions
      which were made to them in later ages in order to meet the increasing
      complexity of affairs were still ascribed by a fiction to the original
      legislator; and the words of such enactments at Athens were disputed over
      as if they had been the words of Solon himself. Plato hopes to preserve in
      a later generation the mind of the legislator; he would have his citizens
      remain within the lines which he has laid down for them. He would not
      harass them with minute regulations, he would have allowed some changes in
      the laws: but not changes which would affect the fundamental institutions
      of the state, such for example as would convert an aristocracy into a
      timocracy, or a timocracy into a popular form of government.
    </p>
<p>
      Passing from speculations to facts, we observe that progress has been the
      exception rather than the law of human history. And therefore we are not
      surprised to find that the idea of progress is of modern rather than of
      ancient date; and, like the idea of a philosophy of history, is not more
      than a century or two old. It seems to have arisen out of the impression
      left on the human mind by the growth of the Roman Empire and of the
      Christian Church, and to be due to the political and social improvements
      which they introduced into the world; and still more in our own century to
      the idealism of the first French Revolution and the triumph of American
      Independence; and in a yet greater degree to the vast material prosperity
      and growth of population in England and her colonies and in America. It is
      also to be ascribed in a measure to the greater study of the philosophy of
      history. The optimist temperament of some great writers has <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxiv"></a>ccxiv</span> assisted the
      creation of it, while the opposite character has led a few to regard the
      future of the world as dark. The ‘spectator of all time and of all
      existence’ sees more of ‘the increasing purpose which through the ages
      ran’ than formerly: but to the inhabitant of a small state of Hellas the
      vision was necessarily limited like the valley in which he dwelt. There
      was no remote past on which his eye could rest, nor any future from which
      the veil was partly lifted up by the analogy of history. The narrowness of
      view, which to ourselves appears so singular, was to him natural, if not
      unavoidable.

      V. For the relation of the Republic to the Statesman and the Laws, and the
      two other works of Plato which directly treat of politics, see the
      Introductions to the two latter; a few general points of comparison may be
      touched upon in this place.
    </p>
<p>
      And first of the Laws. (1) The Republic, though probably written at intervals, yet speaking
      generally and judging by the indications of thought and style, may be
      reasonably ascribed to the middle period of Plato’s life: the Laws are
      certainly the work of his declining years, and some portions of them at
      any rate seem to have been written in extreme old age. (2) The Republic is full of hope and aspiration: the Laws bear the stamp
      of failure and disappointment. The one is a finished work which received
      the last touches of the author: the other is imperfectly executed, and
      apparently unfinished. The one has the grace and beauty of youth: the
      other has lost the poetical form, but has more of the severity and
      knowledge of life which is characteristic of old age. (3) The most conspicuous defect of the Laws is the failure of dramatic
      power, whereas the Republic is full of striking contrasts of ideas and
      oppositions of character. (4) The Laws may be said to have more the nature of a sermon, the Republic
      of a poem; the one is more religious, the other more intellectual. (5) Many theories of Plato, such as the doctrine of ideas, the government
      of the world by philosophers, are not found in the Laws; the immortality
      of the soul is first mentioned in xii. 959, 967; the person of Socrates has
      altogether disappeared. The community of women and children is renounced;
      the institution of common or public meals for women (Laws vi. 781) is for the first time introduced <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxv"></a>ccxv</span> (Ar. Pol. ii. 6, § 5). (6) There remains in the Laws the old enmity to the poets (vii. 817), who are
      ironically saluted in high-flown terms, and, at the same time, are
      peremptorily ordered out of the city, if they are not willing to submit
      their poems to the censorship of the magistrates (cp. Rep. iii. <a href="#stpage398A" class="pginternal">398</a>). (7) Though the work is in most respects inferior, there are a few passages
      in the Laws, such as v. 727 ff. (the honour due to the soul), viii. 835 ff. (the evils of licentious or unnatural love), the whole of Book x. (religion), xi. 918 ff. (the dishonesty of retail trade), and 923 ff. (bequests), which come more home to us, and contain more
      of what may be termed the modern element in Plato than almost anything in
      the Republic.
    </p>
<p>
      The relation of the two works to one another is very well given:
    </p>
<p>
      (i) by Aristotle in the Politics from the side of the Laws:—
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The same, or nearly the same, objections apply to Plato’s later work, the
      Laws, and therefore we had better examine briefly the constitution which
      is therein described. In the Republic, Socrates has definitely settled in
      all a few questions only; such as the community of women and children, the
      community of property, and the constitution of the state. The population
      is divided into two classes—one of husbandmen, and the other of
      warriors; from this latter is taken a third class of counsellors and
      rulers of the state. But Socrates has not determined whether the
      husbandmen and artists are to have a share in the government, and whether
      they too are to carry arms and share in military service or not. He
      certainly thinks that the women ought to share in the education of the
      guardians, and to fight by their side. The remainder of the work is filled
      up with digressions foreign to the main subject, and with discussions
      about the education of the guardians. In the Laws there is hardly anything
      but laws; not much is said about the constitution. This, which he had
      intended to make more of the ordinary type, he gradually brings round to
      the other or ideal form. For with the exception of the community of women
      and property, he supposes everything to be the same in both states; there
      is to be the same education; the citizens of both are to live free from
      servile occupations, and there are to be common meals in both. The only
      difference is that in the Laws the common meals are <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxvi"></a>ccxvi</span> extended to women, and
      the warriors number about 5000, but in the Republic only 1000.’
    </p>
<p>
      (ii) by Plato in the Laws (Book v. 739 B–E), from the side of the Republic:—
    </p>
<p>
      ‘The first and highest form of the state and of the government and of the
      law is that in which there prevails most widely the ancient saying that
      “Friends have all things in common.” Whether there is now, or ever will
      be, this communion of women and children and of property, in which the
      private and individual is altogether banished from life, and things which
      are by nature private, such as eyes and ears and hands, have become
      common, and all men express praise and blame, and feel joy and sorrow, on
      the same occasions, and the laws unite the city to the utmost,—whether
      all this is possible or not, I say that no man, acting upon any other
      principle, will ever constitute a state more exalted in virtue, or truer
      or better than this. Such a state, whether inhabited by Gods or sons of
      Gods, will make them blessed who dwell therein; and therefore to this we
      are to look for the pattern of the state, and to cling to this, and, as
      far as possible, to seek for one which is like this. The state which we
      have now in hand, when created, will be nearest to immortality and unity
      in the next degree; and after that, by the grace of God, we will complete
      the third one. And we will begin by speaking of the nature and origin of
      the second.’
    </p>
<p>
      The comparatively short work called the Statesman or Politicus in its
      style and manner is more akin to the Laws, while in its idealism it rather
      resembles the Republic. As far as we can judge by various indications of
      language and thought, it must be later than the one and of course earlier
      than the other. In both the Republic and Statesman a close connection is
      maintained between Politics and Dialectic. In the Statesman, enquiries
      into the principles of Method are interspersed with discussions about
      Politics. The comparative advantages of the rule of law and of a person
      are considered, and the decision given in favour of a person (Arist.
      Pol. iii. 15, 16). But much may be said on the other side, nor is the opposition
      necessary; for a person may rule by law, and law may be so applied as to
      be the living voice of the legislator. As in the Republic, there is a
      myth, describing, however, not a future, but a former existence of
      mankind. The question is <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxvii"></a>ccxvii</span> asked, ‘Whether the state of innocence which is
      described in the myth, or a state like our own which possesses art and
      science and distinguishes good from evil, is the preferable condition of
      man.’ To this question of the comparative happiness of civilized and
      primitive life, which was so often discussed in the last century and in
      our own, no answer is given. The Statesman, though less perfect in style
      than the Republic and of far less range, may justly be regarded as one of
      the greatest of Plato’s dialogues.
    </p>
<p> </p>
<p id="inVI">
      VI. Others as well as Plato have chosen an ideal Republic to be the vehicle
      of thoughts which they could not definitely express, or which went beyond
      their own age. The classical writing which approaches most nearly to the
      Republic of Plato is the ‘De Republica’ of Cicero; but neither in this nor
      in any other of his dialogues does he rival the art of Plato. The manners
      are clumsy and inferior; the hand of the rhetorician is apparent at every
      turn. Yet noble sentiments are constantly recurring: the true note of
      Roman patriotism—‘We Romans are a great people’—resounds
      through the whole work. Like Socrates, Cicero turns away from the
      phenomena of the heavens to civil and political life. He would rather not
      discuss the ‘two Suns’ of which all Rome was talking, when he can converse
      about ‘the two nations in one’ which had divided Rome ever since the days
      of the Gracchi. Like Socrates again, speaking in the person of Scipio, he
      is afraid lest he should assume too much the character of a teacher,
      rather than of an equal who is discussing among friends the two sides of a
      question. He would confine the terms King or State to the rule of reason
      and justice, and he will not concede that title either to a democracy or
      to a monarchy. But under the rule of reason and justice he is willing to
      include the natural superior ruling over the natural inferior, which he
      compares to the soul ruling over the body. He prefers a mixture of forms
      of government to any single one. The two portraits of the just and the
      unjust, which occur in the second book of the Republic, are transferred to
      the state—Philus, one of the interlocutors, maintaining against his
      will the necessity of injustice as a principle of government, while the
      other, Laelius, supports the opposite thesis. His views of language and
      number are derived <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxviii"></a>ccxviii</span> from Plato; like him he denounces the drama. He also
      declares that if his life were to be twice as long he would have no time
      to read the lyric poets. The picture of democracy is translated by him
      word for word, though he had hardly shown himself able to ‘carry the jest’
      of Plato. He converts into a stately sentence the humorous fancy about the
      animals, who ‘are so imbued with the spirit of democracy that they make
      the passers-by get out of their way’ (i. 42). His description of the tyrant is
      imitated from Plato, but is far inferior. The second book is historical,
      and claims for the Roman constitution (which is to him the ideal) a
      foundation of fact such as Plato probably intended to have given to the
      Republic in the Critias. His most remarkable imitation of Plato is the
      adaptation of the vision of Er, which is converted by Cicero into the
      ‘Somnium Scipionis’; he has ‘romanized’ the myth of the Republic, adding
      an argument for the immortality of the soul taken from the Phaedrus, and
      some other touches derived from the Phaedo and the Timaeus. Though a
      beautiful tale and containing splendid passages, the ‘Somnium Scipionis’
      is very inferior to the vision of Er; it is only a dream, and hardly
      allows the reader to suppose that the writer believes in his own creation.
      Whether his dialogues were framed on the model of the lost dialogues of
      Aristotle, as he himself tells us, or of Plato, to which they bear many
      superficial resemblances, he is still the Roman orator; he is not
      conversing, but making speeches, and is never able to mould the
      intractable Latin to the grace and ease of the Greek Platonic dialogue.
      But if he is defective in form, much more is he inferior to the Greek in
      matter; he nowhere in his philosophical writings leaves upon our minds the
      impression of an original thinker.
    </p>
<p>
      Plato’s Republic has been said to be a church and not a state; and such an
      ideal of a city in the heavens has always hovered over the Christian
      world, and is embodied in St. Augustine’s ‘De Civitate Dei,’ which is
      suggested by the decay and fall of the Roman Empire, much in the same
      manner in which we may imagine the Republic of Plato to have been
      influenced by the decline of Greek politics in the writer’s own age. The
      difference is that in the time of Plato the degeneracy, though certain,
      was gradual and insensible: whereas the taking of Rome by the Goths
      stirred like an earthquake the age of St. Augustine. Men <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxix"></a>ccxix</span> were inclined to
      believe that the overthrow of the city was to be ascribed to the anger
      felt by the old Roman deities at the neglect of their worship. St.
      Augustine maintains the opposite thesis; he argues that the destruction of
      the Roman Empire is due, not to the rise of Christianity, but to the vices
      of Paganism. He wanders over Roman history, and over Greek philosophy and
      mythology, and finds everywhere crime, impiety and falsehood. He compares
      the worst parts of the Gentile religions with the best elements of the
      faith of Christ. He shows nothing of the spirit which led others of the
      early Christian Fathers to recognize in the writings of the Greek
      philosophers the power of the divine truth. He traces the parallel of the
      kingdom of God, that is, the history of the Jews, contained in their
      scriptures, and of the kingdoms of the world, which are found in gentile
      writers, and pursues them both into an ideal future. It need hardly be
      remarked that his use both of Greek and of Roman historians and of the
      sacred writings of the Jews is wholly uncritical. The heathen mythology,
      the Sybilline oracles, the myths of Plato, the dreams of Neo-Platonists
      are equally regarded by him as matter of fact. He must be acknowledged to
      be a strictly polemical or controversial writer who makes the best of
      everything on one side and the worst of everything on the other. He has no
      sympathy with the old Roman life as Plato has with Greek life, nor has he
      any idea of the ecclesiastical kingdom which was to arise out of the ruins
      of the Roman empire. He is not blind to the defects of the Christian
      Church, and looks forward to a time when Christian and Pagan shall be
      alike brought before the judgment-seat, and the true City of God shall
      appear…. The work of St. Augustine is a curious repertory of antiquarian
      learning and quotations, deeply penetrated with Christian ethics, but
      showing little power of reasoning, and a slender knowledge of the Greek
      literature and language. He was a great genius, and a noble character, yet
      hardly capable of feeling or understanding anything external to his own
      theology. Of all the ancient philosophers he is most attracted by Plato,
      though he is very slightly acquainted with his writings. He is inclined to
      believe that the idea of creation in the Timaeus is derived from the
      narrative in Genesis; and he is strangely taken with the coincidence (?)
      of Plato’s saying that ‘the philosopher <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxx"></a>ccxx</span> is the lover of God,’ and the
      words of the Book of Exodus in which God reveals himself to Moses (Exod. iii. 14)
      He dwells at length on miracles performed in his own day, of which the
      evidence is regarded by him as irresistible. He speaks in a very
      interesting manner of the beauty and utility of nature and of the human
      frame, which he conceives to afford a foretaste of the heavenly state and
      of the resurrection of the body. The book is not really what to most
      persons the title of it would imply, and belongs to an age which has
      passed away. But it contains many fine passages and thoughts which are for
      all time.
    </p>
<p>
      The short treatise de Monarchia of Dante is by far the most remarkable of
      mediæval ideals, and bears the impress of the great genius in whom Italy
      and the Middle Ages are so vividly reflected. It is the vision of an
      Universal Empire, which is supposed to be the natural and necessary
      government of the world, having a divine authority distinct from the
      Papacy, yet coextensive with it. It is not ‘the ghost of the dead Roman
      Empire sitting crowned upon the grave thereof,’ but the legitimate heir
      and successor of it, justified by the ancient virtues of the Romans and
      the beneficence of their rule. Their right to be the governors of the
      world is also confirmed by the testimony of miracles, and acknowledged by
      St. Paul when he appealed to Cæsar, and even more emphatically by Christ
      Himself, Who could not have made atonement for the sins of men if He had
      not been condemned by a divinely authorized tribunal. The necessity for
      the establishment of an Universal Empire is proved partly by a priori
      arguments such as the unity of God and the unity of the family or nation;
      partly by perversions of Scripture and history, by false analogies of
      nature, by misapplied quotations from the classics, and by odd scraps and
      commonplaces of logic, showing a familiar but by no means exact knowledge
      of Aristotle (of Plato there is none). But a more convincing argument
      still is the miserable state of the world, which he touchingly describes.
      He sees no hope of happiness or peace for mankind until all nations of the
      earth are comprehended in a single empire. The whole treatise shows how
      deeply the idea of the Roman Empire was fixed in the minds of his
      contemporaries. Not much argument was needed to maintain the truth of a
      theory which to his own <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxxi"></a>ccxxi</span> contemporaries seemed so natural and congenial. He
      speaks, or rather preaches, from the point of view, not of the
      ecclesiastic, but of the layman, although, as a good Catholic, he is
      willing to acknowledge that in certain respects the Empire must submit to
      the Church. The beginning and end of all his noble reflections and of his
      arguments, good and bad, is the aspiration ‘that in this little plot of
      earth belonging to mortal man life may pass in freedom and peace.’ So
      inextricably is his vision of the future bound up with the beliefs and
      circumstances of his own age.

      The ‘Utopia’ of Sir Thomas More is a surprising monument of his genius,
      and shows a reach of thought far beyond his contemporaries. The book was
      written by him at the age of about 34 or 35, and is full of the generous
      sentiments of youth. He brings the light of Plato to bear upon the
      miserable state of his own country. Living not long after the Wars of the
      Roses, and in the dregs of the Catholic Church in England, he is indignant
      at the corruption of the clergy, at the luxury of the nobility and gentry,
      at the sufferings of the poor, at the calamities caused by war. To the eye
      of More the whole world was in dissolution and decay; and side by side
      with the misery and oppression which he has described in the First Book of
      the Utopia, he places in the Second Book the ideal state which by the help
      of Plato he had constructed. The times were full of stir and intellectual
      interest. The distant murmur of the Reformation was beginning to be heard.
      To minds like More’s, Greek literature was a revelation: there had arisen
      an art of interpretation, and the New Testament was beginning to be
      understood as it had never been before, and has not often been since, in
      its natural sense. The life there depicted appeared to him wholly unlike
      that of Christian commonwealths, in which ‘he saw nothing but a certain
      conspiracy of rich men procuring their own commodities under the name and
      title of the Commonwealth.’ He thought that Christ, like Plato,
      ‘instituted all things common,’ for which reason, he tells us, the
      citizens of Utopia were the more willing to receive his doctrines<a href="#Footnoteintro5" id="FnAnchorintro5" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">5</span></a>.
       The community of <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxxii"></a>ccxxii</span> property is a fixed
      idea with him, though he is aware of the arguments which may be urged on
      the other side<a href="#Footnoteintro6" id="FnAnchorintro6" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">6</span></a>. We wonder
      how in the reign of Henry VIII, though veiled in another language and
      published in a foreign country, such speculations could have been endured.

furtherance in the matter, that they heard us say that Christ instituted
among his, all things common, and that the same community doth yet
remain in the rightest Christian communities’ (Utopia, English Reprints, p. 144).</p></div>

when I consider with myself, I hold well with Plato, and do nothing
marvel that he would make no laws for them that refused those laws,
whereby all men should have and enjoy equal portions of riches and
commodities. For the wise men did easily foresee this to be the one and
only way to the wealth of a community, if equality of all things should
be brought in and established’ (Utopia, English Reprints, p. 67, 68).</p></div>
<p>
      He is gifted with far greater dramatic invention than any one who
      succeeded him, with the exception of Swift. In the art of feigning he is a
      worthy disciple of Plato. Like him, starting from a small portion of fact,
      he founds his tale with admirable skill on a few lines in the Latin
      narrative of the voyages of Amerigo Vespucci. He is very precise about
      dates and facts, and has the power of making us believe that the narrator
      of the tale must have been an eyewitness. We are fairly puzzled by his
      manner of mixing up real and imaginary persons; his boy John Clement and
      Peter Giles, citizen of Antwerp, with whom he disputes about the precise
      words which are supposed to have been used by the (imaginary) Portuguese
      traveller, Raphael Hythloday. ‘I have the more cause,’ says Hythloday, ‘to
      fear that my words shall not be believed, for that I know how difficultly
      and hardly I myself would have believed another man telling the same, if I
      had not myself seen it with mine own eyes.’ Or again: ‘If you had been
      with me in Utopia, and had presently seen their fashions and laws as I did
      which lived there five years and more, and would never have come thence,
      but only to make the new land known here,’ etc. More greatly regrets that
      he forgot to ask Hythloday in what part of the world Utopia is situated;
      he ‘would have spent no small sum of money rather than it should have
      escaped him,’ and he begs Peter Giles to see Hythloday or write to him and
      obtain an answer to the question. After this we are not surprised to hear
      that a Professor of Divinity (perhaps ‘a late famous vicar of Croydon in
      Surrey,’ as the translator thinks) is desirous of being sent thither as a
      missionary by the High Bishop, ‘yea, and that he may himself be made
      Bishop of Utopia, nothing doubting that he must obtain this Bishopric with
      suit; and he counteth that a godly <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxxiii"></a>ccxxiii</span> suit which proceedeth not of the desire
      of honour or lucre, but only of a godly zeal.’ The design may have failed
      through the disappearance of Hythloday, concerning whom we have ‘very
      uncertain news’ after his departure. There is no doubt, however, that he
      had told More and Giles the exact situation of the island, but
      unfortunately at the same moment More’s attention, as he is reminded in a
      letter from Giles, was drawn off by a servant, and one of the company from
      a cold caught on shipboard coughed so loud as to prevent Giles from
      hearing. And ‘the secret has perished’ with him; to this day the place of
      Utopia remains unknown.

      The words of Phaedrus (275 B), ‘O Socrates, you can easily invent Egyptians or
      anything,’ are recalled to our mind as we read this lifelike fiction. Yet
      the greater merit of the work is not the admirable art, but the
      originality of thought. More is as free as Plato from the prejudices of
      his age, and far more tolerant. The Utopians do not allow him who believes
      not in the immortality of the soul to share in the administration of the
      state (cp. Laws x. 908 foll.), ‘howbeit they put him to no punishment, because they be
      persuaded that it is in no man’s power to believe what he list’; and ‘no
      man is to be blamed for reasoning in support of his own religion<a href="#Footnoteintro7" id="FnAnchorintro7" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">7</span></a>.’ In the public services ‘no prayers be used, but such as
      every man may boldly pronounce without giving offence to any sect.’ He
      says significantly, ‘There be that give worship to a man that was once of
      excellent virtue or of famous glory, not only as God, but also the
      chiefest and highest God. But the most and the wisest part, rejecting all
      these, believe that there is a certain godly power unknown, far above the
      capacity and reach of man’s wit, dispersed throughout all the world, not
      in bigness, but in virtue and power. Him they call the Father of all. To
      Him alone they attribute the beginnings, the increasings, the proceedings, <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxxiv"></a>ccxxiv</span>
      the changes, and the ends of all things. Neither give they any divine
      honours to any other than him.’ So far was More from sharing the popular
      beliefs of his time. Yet at the end he reminds us that he does not in all
      respects agree with the customs and opinions of the Utopians which he
      describes. And we should let him have the benefit of this saving clause,
      and not rudely withdraw the veil behind which he has been pleased to
      conceal himself.

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnoteintro7"></a><a href="#FnAnchorintro7" class="pginternal">7</a></span> ‘One of
      our company in my presence was sharply punished. He, as soon as he was
      baptised, began, against our wills, with more earnest affection than
      wisdom, to reason of Christ’s religion, and began to wax so hot in his
      matter, that he did not only prefer our religion before all other, but
      also did despise and condemn all other, calling them profane, and the
      followers of them wicked and devilish, and the children of everlasting
      damnation. When he had thus long reasoned the matter, they laid hold on
      him, accused him, and condemned him into exile, not as a despiser of
      religion, but as a seditious person and a raiser up of dissension among
      the people’ (p. 145).</p></div>
<p>
      Nor is he less in advance of popular opinion in his political and moral
      speculations. He would like to bring military glory into contempt; he
      would set all sorts of idle people to profitable occupation, including in
      the same class, priests, women, noblemen, gentlemen, and ‘sturdy and
      valiant beggars,’ that the labour of all may be reduced to six hours a
      day. His dislike of capital punishment, and plans for the reformation of
      offenders; his detestation of priests and lawyers<a href="#Footnoteintro8" id="FnAnchorintro8" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">8</span></a>; his remark that ‘although every one may hear of
      ravenous dogs and wolves and cruel man-eaters, it is not easy to find
      states that are well and wisely governed,’ are curiously at variance with
      the notions of his age and indeed with his own life. There are many points
      in which he shows a modern feeling and a prophetic insight like Plato. He
      is a sanitary reformer; he maintains that civilized states have a right to
      the soil of waste countries; he is inclined to the opinion which places
      happiness in virtuous pleasures, but herein, as he thinks, not disagreeing
      from those other philosophers who define virtue to be a life according to
      nature. He extends the idea of happiness so as to include the happiness of
      others; and he argues ingeniously, ‘All men agree that we ought to make
      others happy; but if others, how much more ourselves!’ And still he thinks
      that there may be a more excellent way, but to this no man’s reason can
      attain unless heaven should inspire him with a higher truth. His
      ceremonies before marriage; his <em>humane</em> proposal that war should be carried
      on by assassinating the leaders of the enemy, may be compared to some of
      the paradoxes of Plato. He has a charming fancy, like the affinities of
      Greeks and barbarians in the Timaeus, that the Utopians learnt the
      language of the Greeks with the more readiness because they were
      originally of the same race with them. He is penetrated with the spirit of
      Plato, and quotes or adapts many <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxxv"></a>ccxxv</span> thoughts both from the Republic and from
      the Timaeus. He prefers public duties to private, and is somewhat
      impatient of the importunity of relations. His citizens have no silver or
      gold of their own, but are ready enough to pay them to their mercenaries (cp. Rep. iv. <a href="#stpage422A" class="pginternal">422</a>, <a href="#stpage423A" class="pginternal">423</a>).
      There is nothing of which he is more contemptuous than the love of money.
      Gold is used for fetters of criminals, and diamonds and pearls for
      children’s necklaces<a href="#Footnoteintro9" id="FnAnchorintro9" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">9</span></a>.

      they most reverently saluted the vilest and most abject of them for lords—passing
      over the ambassadors themselves without any honour, judging them by their
      wearing of golden chains to be bondmen. You should have seen children
      also, that had cast away their pearls and precious stones, when they saw
      the like sticking upon the ambassadors’ caps, dig and push their mothers
      under the sides, saying thus to them—“Look, mother, how great a lubber doth yet wear pearls and precious stones, as though he were a little
      child still.” But the mother; yea and that also in good earnest: “Peace,
      son,” saith she, “I think he be some of the ambassadors’ fools”’ (p. 102).</p></div>
<p>
      Like Plato he is full of satirical reflections on governments and princes;
      on the state of the world and of knowledge. The hero of his discourse
      (Hythloday) is very unwilling to become a minister of state, considering
      that he would lose his independence and his advice would never be heeded<a href="#Footnoteintro10" id="FnAnchorintro10" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">10</span></a>.
       He ridicules the
      new logic of his time; the Utopians could never be made to understand the
      doctrine of Second Intentions<a href="#Footnoteintro11" id="FnAnchorintro11" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">11</span></a>. He is very
      severe on the sports of the gentry; the Utopians count ‘hunting the
      lowest, the vilest, and the most abject part of butchery.’ He quotes the
      words of the Republic in which the philosopher is described ‘standing out
      of the way under a wall until the driving storm of sleet and rain be
      overpast,’ which admit of a singular application to More’s own fate;
      although, writing twenty years before (about the year 1514), <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxxvi"></a>ccxxvi</span> he can hardly
      be supposed to have foreseen this. There is no touch of satire which
      strikes deeper than his quiet remark that the greater part of the precepts
      of Christ are more at variance with the lives of ordinary Christians than
      the discourse of Utopia<a href="#Footnoteintro12" id="FnAnchorintro12" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">12</span></a>.

<p>
      The ‘New Atlantis’ is only a fragment, and far inferior in merit to the
      ‘Utopia.’ The work is full of ingenuity, but wanting in creative fancy,
      and by no means impresses the reader with a sense of credibility. In some
      places Lord Bacon is characteristically different from Sir Thomas More,
      as, for example, in the external state which he attributes to the governor
      of Solomon’s House, whose dress he minutely describes, while to Sir Thomas
      More such trappings appear simple ridiculous. Yet, after this programme of
      dress, Bacon adds the beautiful trait, ‘that he had a look as though he
      pitied men.’ Several things are borrowed by him from the Timaeus; but he
      has injured the unity of style by adding thoughts and passages which are
      taken from the Hebrew Scriptures.
    </p>
<p>
      The ‘City of the Sun’ written by Campanella (1568–1639), a Dominican
      friar, several years after the ‘New Atlantis’ of Bacon, has many
      resemblances to the Republic of Plato. The citizens have wives and
      children in common; their marriages are of the same temporary sort, and
      are arranged by the magistrates from time to time. They do not, however,
      adopt his system of lots, but bring together the best natures, male and
      female, ‘according to philosophical rules.’ The infants until two years of
      age are brought up by their mothers in public temples; and since
      individuals for the most part educate their children badly, at the
      beginning of their third year they are committed to the care of the State,
      and are taught at first, not out of books, but from paintings of all
      kinds, which are emblazoned on the walls of the city. The city has six
      interior circuits of walls, and an outer wall which is the seventh. On
      this outer wall are painted the figures of legislators and philosophers,
      and <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxxvii"></a>ccxxvii</span> on each of the interior walls the symbols or forms of some one of the
      sciences are delineated. The women are, for the most part, trained, like
      the men, in warlike and other exercises; but they have two special
      occupations of their own. After a battle, they and the boys soothe and
      relieve the wounded warriors; also they encourage them with embraces and
      pleasant words (cp. Plato, Rep. v. <a href="#stpage468A" class="pginternal">468</a>). Some elements of the Christian or Catholic religion are
      preserved among them. The life of the Apostles is greatly admired by this
      people because they had all things in common; and the short prayer which
      Jesus Christ taught men is used in their worship. It is a duty of the
      chief magistrates to pardon sins, and therefore the whole people make
      secret confession of them to the magistrates, and they to their chief, who
      is a sort of Rector Metaphysicus; and by this means he is well informed of
      all that is going on in the minds of men. After confession, absolution is
      granted to the citizens collectively, but no one is mentioned by name.
      There also exists among them a practice of perpetual prayer, performed by
      a succession of priests, who change every hour. Their religion is a
      worship of God in Trinity, that is of Wisdom, Love and Power, but without
      any distinction of persons. They behold in the sun the reflection of His
      glory; mere graven images they reject, refusing to fall under the
      ‘tyranny’ of idolatry.
    </p>
<p>
      Many details are given about their customs of eating and drinking, about
      their mode of dressing, their employments, their wars. Campanella looks
      forward to a new mode of education, which is to be a study of nature, and
      not of Aristotle. He would not have his citizens waste their time in the
      consideration of what he calls ‘the dead signs of things.’ He remarks that
      he who knows one science only, does not really know that one any more than
      the rest, and insists strongly on the necessity of a variety of knowledge.
      More scholars are turned out in the City of the Sun in one year than by
      contemporary methods in ten or fifteen. He evidently believes, like Bacon,
      that henceforward natural science will play a great part in education, a
      hope which seems hardly to have been realized, either in our own or in any
      former age; at any rate the fulfilment of it has been long deferred.
    </p>
<p>
      There is a good deal of ingenuity and even originality in this <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxxviii"></a>ccxxviii</span> work, and a
      most enlightened spirit pervades it. But it has little or no charm of
      style, and falls very far short of the ‘New Atlantis’ of Bacon, and still
      more of the ‘Utopia’ of Sir Thomas More. It is full of inconsistencies,
      and though borrowed from Plato, shows but a superficial acquaintance with
      his writings. It is a work such as one might expect to have been written
      by a philosopher and man of genius who was also a friar, and who had spent
      twenty-seven years of his life in a prison of the Inquisition. The most
      interesting feature of the book, common to Plato and Sir Thomas More, is
      the deep feeling which is shown by the writer, of the misery and ignorance
      prevailing among the lower classes in his own time. Campanella takes note
      of Aristotle’s answer to Plato’s community of property, that in a society
      where all things are common, no individual would have any motive to work
      (Arist. Pol. ii. 5, § 6): he replies, that his citizens being happy and contented in
      themselves (they are required to work only four hours a day), will have
      greater regard for their fellows than exists among men at present. He
      thinks, like Plato, that if he abolishes private feelings and interests, a
      great public feeling will take their place.
    </p>
<p>
      Other writings on ideal states, such as the ‘Oceana’ of Harrington, in
      which the Lord Archon, meaning Cromwell, is described, not as he was, but
      as he ought to have been; or the ‘Argenis’ of Barclay, which is an
      historical allegory of his own time, are too unlike Plato to be worth
      mentioning. More interesting than either of these, and far more Platonic
      in style and thought, is Sir John Eliot’s ‘Monarchy of Man,’ in which the
      prisoner of the Tower, no longer able ‘to be a politician in the land of
      his birth,’ turns away from politics to view ‘that other city which is
      within him,’ and finds on the very threshold of the grave that the secret
      of human happiness is the mastery of self. The change of government in the
      time of the English Commonwealth set men thinking about first principles,
      and gave rise to many works of this class…. The great original genius of
      Swift owes nothing to Plato; nor is there any trace in the conversation or
      in the works of Dr. Johnson of any acquaintance with his writings. He
      probably would have refuted Plato without reading him, in the same fashion
      in which he supposed himself to have refuted Bishop Berkeley’s theory of
      the non-existence of matter. If we <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxxix"></a>ccxxix</span> except the so-called English
      Platonists, or rather Neo-Platonists, who never understood their master,
      and the writings of Coleridge, who was to some extent a kindred spirit,
      Plato has left no permanent impression on English literature.

<p id="inVII">
      VII. Human life and conduct are affected by ideals in the same way that they
      are affected by the examples of eminent men. Neither the one nor the other
      are immediately applicable to practice, but there is a virtue flowing from
      them which tends to raise individuals above the common routine of society
      or trade, and to elevate States above the mere interests of commerce or
      the necessities of self-defence. Like the ideals of art they are partly
      framed by the omission of particulars; they require to be viewed at a
      certain distance, and are apt to fade away if we attempt to approach them.
      They gain an imaginary distinctness when embodied in a State or in a
      system of philosophy, but they still remain the visions of ‘a world
      unrealized.’ More striking and obvious to the ordinary mind are the
      examples of great men, who have served their own generation and are
      remembered in another. Even in our own family circle there may have been
      some one, a woman, or even a child, in whose face has shone forth a
      goodness more than human. The ideal then approaches nearer to us, and we
      fondly cling to it. The ideal of the past, whether of our own past lives
      or of former states of society, has a singular fascination for the minds
      of many. Too late we learn that such ideals cannot be recalled, though the
      recollection of them may have a humanizing influence on other times. But
      the abstractions of philosophy are to most persons cold and vacant; they
      give light without warmth; they are like the full moon in the heavens when
      there are no stars appearing. Men cannot live by thought alone; the world
      of sense is always breaking in upon them. They are for the most part
      confined to a corner of earth, and see but a little way beyond their own
      home or place of abode; they ‘do not lift up their eyes to the hills’;
      they are not awake when the dawn appears. But in Plato we have reached a
      height from which a man may look into the distance (Rep. iv. <a href="#stpage445C" class="pginternal">445 C</a>) and behold the future
      of the world and of philosophy. The ideal of the State and of the life of
      the philosopher; the ideal of an education <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxxx"></a>ccxxx</span> continuing through life and
      extending equally to both sexes; the ideal of the unity and correlation of
      knowledge; the faith in good and immortality—are the vacant forms of
      light on which Plato is seeking to fix the eye of mankind.
    </p>
<p> </p>
<p id="inVIII">
      VIII. Two other ideals, which never appeared above the horizon in Greek
      Philosophy, float before the minds of men in our own day: one seen more
      clearly than formerly, as though each year and each generation brought us
      nearer to some great change; the other almost in the same degree retiring
      from view behind the laws of nature, as if oppressed by them, but still
      remaining a silent hope of we know not what hidden in the heart of man.
      The first ideal is the future of the human race in this world; the second
      the future of the individual in another. The first is the more perfect
      realization of our own present life; the second, the abnegation of it: the
      one, limited by experience, the other, transcending it. Both of them have
      been and are powerful motives of action; there are a few in whom they have
      taken the place of all earthly interests. The hope of a future for the
      human race at first sight seems to be the more disinterested, the hope of
      individual existence the more egotistical, of the two motives. But when
      men have learned to resolve their hope of a future either for themselves
      or for the world into the will of God—‘not my will but Thine,’ the
      difference between them falls away; and they may be allowed to make either
      of them the basis of their lives, according to their own individual
      character or temperament. There is as much faith in the willingness to
      work for an unseen future in this world as in another. Neither is it
      inconceivable that some rare nature may feel his duty to another
      generation, or to another century, almost as strongly as to his own, or
      that living always in the presence of God, he may realize another world as
      vividly as he does this.
    </p>
<p>
      The greatest of all ideals may, or rather must be conceived by us under
      similitudes derived from human qualities; although sometimes, like the
      Jewish prophets, we may dash away these figures of speech and describe the
      nature of God only in negatives. These again by degrees acquire a positive
      meaning. It would be well, if when meditating on the higher truths either
      of <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageccxxxi"></a>ccxxxi</span> philosophy or religion, we sometimes substituted one form of expression
      for another, lest through the necessities of language we should become the
      slaves of mere words.
    </p>
<p>
      There is a third ideal, not the same, but akin to these, which has a place
      in the home and heart of every believer in the religion of Christ, and in
      which men seem to find a nearer and more familiar truth, the Divine man,
      the Son of Man, the Saviour of mankind, Who is the first-born and head of
      the whole family in heaven and earth, in Whom the Divine and human, that
      which is without and that which is within the range of our earthly
      faculties, are indissolubly united. Neither is this divine form of
      goodness wholly separable from the ideal of the Christian Church, which is
      said in the New Testament to be ‘His body,’ or at variance with those
      other images of good which Plato sets before us. We see Him in a figure
      only, and of figures of speech we select but a few, and those the
      simplest, to be the expression of Him. We behold Him in a picture, but He
      is not there. We gather up the fragments of His discourses, but neither do
      they represent Him as He truly was. His dwelling is neither in heaven nor
      earth, but in the heart of man. This is that image which Plato saw dimly
      in the distance, which, when existing among men, he called, in the
      language of Homer, ‘the likeness of God’ (Rep. vi. <a href="#stpage501B" class="pginternal">501 B</a>), the likeness of a nature which
      in all ages men have felt to be greater and better than themselves, and
      which in endless forms, whether derived from Scripture or nature, from the
      witness of history or from the human heart, regarded as a person or not as
      a person, with or without parts or passions, existing in space or not in
      space, is and will always continue to be to mankind the Idea of Good.

      The scene is laid in the house of Cephalus at the Piraeus; and the whole

      Timaeus, Hermocrates, Critias, and a nameless person, who are introduced

<span class="sidenote"> <i>Republic I.</i><br>S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, G<span class="smcap">LAUCON</span>.<br>Meeting of Socrates and Glaucon with Polemarchus at the Bendidean festival.</span>  I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston, that
      I might offer up my prayers to the goddess<a href="#Footnotebook11" id="FnAnchorbook11" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">1</span></a>; and also because I wanted to see in what manner they would
      celebrate the festival, which was a new thing. I was delighted with the
      procession of the inhabitants; but that of the Thracians was equally, if
      not more, beautiful. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage327B">B</a></span>When we had finished our prayers and viewed the
      spectacle, we turned in the direction of the city; and at that instant
      Polemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a
      distance as we were starting on our way home, and told his servant to run
      and bid us wait for him. The servant took hold of me by the cloak behind,
      and said: Polemarchus desires you to wait.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook11"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook11" class="pginternal">1</a></span> Bendis, the Thracian
      Artemis.</p></div>
<p>
      I turned round, and asked him where his master was.
    </p>
<p>
      There he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will only wait.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, P<span class="smcap">OLEMARCHUS</span>, G<span class="smcap">LAUCON</span>, A<span class="smcap">DEIMANTUS</span>, C<span class="smcap">EPHALUS</span>.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page2"></a>2</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage327C">C</a></span>Certainly we will, said Glaucon; and in a few minutes Polemarchus
      appeared, and with him Adeimantus, Glaucon’s brother, Niceratus the son of
      Nicias, and several others who had been at the procession.
    </p>
<p>
      Polemarchus said to me: I perceive, Socrates, that you and your companion
      are already on your way to the city.
    </p>
<p>
      You are not far wrong, I said.
    </p>
<p>
      But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?
    </p>
<p>
      Of course.
    </p>
<p>
      And are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to remain
      where you are.
    </p>
<p>
      May there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade you to let
      us go?
    </p>
<p>
      But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not, replied Glaucon.
    </p>
<p>
      Then we are not going to listen; of that you may be assured.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage328A">328</a></span><span class="sidenote">The equestrian torch-race.</span>Adeimantus added: Has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback in
      honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening?
    </p>
<p>
      With horses! I replied: That is a novelty. Will horsemen carry torches and
      pass them one to another during the race?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will be celebrated
      at night, which you certainly ought to see. Let us rise soon after supper
      and see this festival; there will be a gathering of young men, and we will
      have a good talk. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage328B">B</a></span>Stay then, and do not be perverse.
    </p>
<p>
      Glaucon said: I suppose, since you insist, that we must.
    </p>
<p>
      Very good, I replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The gathering of friends at the house of Cephalus.</span>
      Accordingly we went with Polemarchus to his house; and there we found his
      brothers Lysias and Euthydemus, and with them Thrasymachus the
      Chalcedonian, Charmantides the Paeanian, and Cleitophon the son of
      Aristonymus. There too was Cephalus the father of Polemarchus, whom I had
      not seen for a long time, and I thought him very much aged. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage328C">C</a></span>He was seated
      on a cushioned chair, and had a garland on his head, for he had been
      sacrificing in the court; and there were some other chairs in the room
      arranged in a semicircle, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page3"></a>3</span> upon which we sat down by him. He saluted me
      eagerly, and then he said:—
    </p>
<p>
<span class="sidenote">C<span class="smcap">EPHALUS</span>, S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>.</span>You don’t come to see me, Socrates, as often as you ought: If I were still
      able to go and see you I would not ask you to come to me. But at my age I
      can hardly get to the city, and therefore you should come oftener to the
      Piraeus. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage328D">D</a></span>For let me tell you, that the more the pleasures of the body fade
      away, the greater to me is the pleasure and charm of conversation. Do not
      then deny my request, but make our house your resort and keep company with
      these young men; we are old friends, and you will be quite at home with
      us.
    </p>
<p>
      I replied: There is nothing which for my part I like better, Cephalus,
      than conversing with aged men; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage328E">E</a></span>for I regard them as travellers who have
      gone a journey which I too may have to go, and of whom I ought to enquire,
      whether the way is smooth and easy, or rugged and difficult. And this is a
      question which I should like to ask of you who have arrived at that time
      which the poets call the ‘threshold of old age’—Is life harder
      towards the end, or what report do you give of it?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage329A">329</a></span><span class="sidenote">Old age is not to blame for the troubles of old men.</span>
      I will tell you, Socrates, he said, what my own feeling is. Men of my age
      flock together; we are birds of a feather, as the old proverb says; and at
      our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is—I cannot eat, I
      cannot drink; the pleasures of youth and love are fled away: there was a
      good time once, but now that is gone, and life is no longer life. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage329B">B</a></span>Some
      complain of the slights which are put upon them by relations, and they
      will tell you sadly of how many evils their old age is the cause. But to
      me, Socrates, these complainers seem to blame that which is not really in
      fault. For if old age were the cause, I too being old, and every other old
      man, would have felt as they do. But this is not my own experience, nor
      that of others whom I have known. How well I remember the aged poet
      Sophocles, when in answer to the question, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage329C">C</a></span>How does love suit with age,
      Sophocles,—are you still the man you were? <span class="sidenote">The excellent saying of Sophocles.</span>Peace, he replied; most
      gladly have I escaped the thing of which you speak; I feel as if I had
      escaped from a mad and furious master. His words have often occurred to my
      mind since, and they seem as good to me now as at the time when he uttered
      them. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page4"></a>4</span> For certainly old age has a great sense of calm and freedom; when
      the passions relax their hold, then, as Sophocles says,<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage329D">D</a></span> we are freed from
      the grasp not of one mad master only, but of many. The truth is, Socrates,
      that these regrets, and also the complaints about relations, are to be
      attributed to the same cause, which is not old age, but men’s characters
      and tempers; for he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the
      pressure of age, but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and
      age are equally a burden.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">It is admitted
that the old, if they are to be comfortable, must have a fair share of
external goods; neither virtue alone nor riches alone can make an old
man happy.</span>
      I listened in admiration, and wanting to draw him out, that he might go on—<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage329E">E</a></span>Yes,
      Cephalus, I said: but I rather suspect that people in general are not
      convinced by you when you speak thus; they think that old age sits lightly
      upon you, not because of your happy disposition, but because you are rich,
      and wealth is well known to be a great comforter.
    </p>
<p>
      You are right, he replied; they are not convinced: and there is something
      in what they say; not, however, so much as they imagine. I might answer
      them as Themistocles answered the Seriphian who was abusing him and saying
      that he was famous, not for his own merits but because he <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage330A">330</a></span>was an Athenian:
      ‘If you had been a native of my country or I of yours, neither of us would
      have been famous.’ And to those who are not rich and are impatient of old
      age, the same reply may be made; for to the good poor man old age cannot
      be a light burden, nor can a bad rich man ever have peace with himself.
    </p>
<p>
      May I ask, Cephalus, whether your fortune was for the most part inherited
      or acquired by you?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Cephalus has inherited rather than made a fortune; he is therefore indifferent to money.</span>
      Acquired! <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage330B">B</a></span>Socrates; do you want to know how much I acquired? In the art of
      making money I have been midway between my father and grandfather: for my
      grandfather, whose name I bear, doubled and trebled the value of his
      patrimony, that which he inherited being much what I possess now; but my
      father Lysanias reduced the property below what it is at present: and I
      shall be satisfied if I leave to these my sons not less but a little more
      than I received.
    </p>
<p>
      That was why I asked you the question, I replied, because I see that you
      are indifferent about money, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage330C">C</a></span>which is a characteristic rather of those who
      have inherited their fortunes than of those who have acquired them; the
      makers <span class="pagenum"><a id="page5"></a>5</span> of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation of their own,
      resembling the affection of authors for their own poems, or of parents for
      their children, besides that natural love of it for the sake of use and
      profit which is common to them and all men. And hence they are very bad
      company, for they can talk about nothing but the praises of wealth.
    </p>
<p>
      That is true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The advantages of wealth.</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage330D">D</a></span>Yes, that is very true, but may I ask another question?—What do you
      consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your
      wealth?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The fear of death and the consciousness of sin become more vivid in old age; and to be rich frees a man from many temptations.</span>
      One, he said, of which I could not expect easily to convince others. For
      let me tell you, Socrates, that when a man thinks himself to be near
      death, fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had before; the
      tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted there of deeds
      done here were once a laughing matter to him, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage330E">E</a></span>but now he is tormented with
      the thought that they may be true: either from the weakness of age, or
      because he is now drawing nearer to that other place, he has a clearer
      view of these things; suspicions and alarms crowd thickly upon him, and he
      begins to reflect and consider what wrongs he has done to others. And when
      he finds that the sum of his transgressions is great he will many a time
      like a child start up in his sleep for fear, and he is filled with dark
      forebodings. But <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage331A">331</a></span>to him who is conscious of no sin, sweet hope, as Pindar
      charmingly says, is the kind nurse of his age:</p>
<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="noind">
      ‘Hope,’ he says, ‘cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice and
      holiness, and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his journey;—hope
      which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man.’
    <span class="sidenote">The admirable strain of Pindar.</span></p></div></div>
<p class="noind">
      How admirable are his words! And the great blessing of riches, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage331B">B</a></span>I do not
      say to every man, but to a good man, is, that he has had no occasion to
      deceive or to defraud others, either intentionally or unintentionally; and
      when he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension about
      offerings due to the gods or debts which he owes to men. Now to this peace
      of mind the possession of wealth greatly contributes; and therefore I say,
      that, setting one thing against another, of the many advantages which
      wealth has to give, to a man of sense this is in my opinion the greatest. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page6"></a>6</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">C<span class="smcap">EPHALUS</span>, S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, P<span class="smcap">OLEMARCHUS</span>.<br>Justice to speak truth and pay your debts.</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage331C">C</a></span>Well said, Cephalus, I replied; but as concerning justice, what is it?—to
      speak the truth and to pay your debts—no more than this? And even to
      this are there not exceptions? Suppose that a friend when in his right
      mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he is not in his
      right mind, ought I to give them back to him? No one would say that I
      ought or that I should be right in doing so, any more than they would say
      that I ought always to speak the truth to one who is in his condition.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage331D">D</a></span>You are quite right, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      But then, I said, speaking the truth and paying your debts is not a
      correct definition of justice.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">This is the definition of Simonides. But you ought not on all occasions to do either. What then was his meaning?</span>
      Quite correct, Socrates, if Simonides is to be believed, said Polemarchus
      interposing.
    </p>
<p>
      I fear, said Cephalus, that I must go now, for I have to look after the
      sacrifices, and I hand over the argument to Polemarchus and the company.
    </p>
<p>
      Is not Polemarchus your heir? I said.
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure, he answered, and went away laughing to the sacrifices.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage331E">E</a></span>Tell me then, O thou heir of the argument, what did Simonides say, and
      according to you truly say, about justice?
    </p>
<p>
      He said that the repayment of a debt is just, and in saying so he appears
      to me to be right.
    </p>
<p>
      I should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired man, but
      his meaning, though probably clear to you, is the reverse of clear to me.
      For he certainly does not mean, as we were just now saying, that I ought
      to return a deposit of arms or of anything else to one who asks for it
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage332A">332</a></span>when he is not in his right senses; and yet a deposit cannot be denied to
      be a debt.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      Then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind I am by no means
      to make the return?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      When Simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice, he did not
      mean to include that case?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not; for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good to a

<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage332B">B</a></span>You mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury of
      the receiver, if the two parties are friends, is not the repayment of a
      debt,—that is what you would imagine him to say?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And are enemies also to receive what we owe to them?
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure, he said, they are to receive what we owe them, and an enemy,
      as I take it, owes to an enemy that which is due or proper to him—that
      is to say, evil.
    </p>
<p>
      Simonides, then, after the manner of poets, would seem to have spoken
      darkly of the nature of justice; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage332C">C</a></span>for he really meant to say that justice
      is the giving to each man what is proper to him, and this he termed a
      debt.
    </p>
<p>
      That must have been his meaning, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      By heaven! I replied; and if we asked him what due or proper thing is
      given by medicine, and to whom, what answer do you think that he would
      make to us?
    </p>
<p>
      He would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink to
      human bodies.
    </p>
<p>
      And what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to what?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage332D">D</a></span>Seasoning to food.
    </p>
<p>
      And what is that which justice gives, and to whom?
    </p>
<p>
      If, Socrates, we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the preceding
      instances, then justice is the art which gives good to friends and evil to
      enemies.
    </p>
<p>
      That is his meaning then?
    </p>
<p>
      I think so.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Illustrations.</span>
      And who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies in
      time of sickness?
    </p>
<p>
      The physician.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage332E">E</a></span>Or when they are on a voyage, amid the perils of the sea?
    </p>
<p>
      The pilot.
    </p>
<p>
      And in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just man
      most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friend?
    </p>
<p>
      In going to war against the one and in making alliances with the other.
    </p>
<p>
      But when a man is well, my dear Polemarchus, there is no need of a
      physician? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page8"></a>8</span>
</p>
<p>
      No.
    </p>
<p>
      And he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot?
    </p>
<p>
      No.
    </p>
<p>
      Then in time of peace justice will be of no use?
    </p>
<p>
      I am very far from thinking so.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage333A">333</a></span>You think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Like husbandry for the acquisition of corn?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes,—that is what you
      mean?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of peace?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Justice is useful in contracts,</span>
      In contracts, Socrates, justice is of use.
    </p>
<p>
      And by contracts you mean partnerships?
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage333B">B</a></span>But is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better partner
      at a game of draughts?
    </p>
<p>
      The skilful player.
    </p>
<p>
      And in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful or
      better partner than the builder?
    </p>
<p>
      Quite the reverse.
    </p>
<p>
      Then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than the
      harp-player, as in playing the harp the harp-player is certainly a better
      partner than the just man?
    </p>
<p>
      In a money partnership.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, Polemarchus, but surely not in the use of money; for you do not want
      a just man to be your counsellor in the purchase or sale of a horse; a man
      who is knowing about <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage333C">C</a></span>horses would be better for that, would he not?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would be
      better?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      Then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man is to
      be preferred?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">especially in the safe-keeping of deposits.</span>
      When you want a deposit to be kept safely.
    </p>
<p>
      You mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to lie? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page9"></a>9</span>
</p>
<p>
      Precisely.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">But not in the use of money: and if so, justice is only useful when money or anything else is useless.</span>
      That is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage333D">D</a></span>That is the inference.
    </p>
<p>
      And when you want to keep a pruning-hook safe, then justice is useful to
      the individual and to the state; but when you want to use it, then the art
      of the vine-dresser?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      And when you want to keep a shield or a lyre, and not to use them, you
      would say that justice is useful; but when you want to use them, then the
      art of the soldier or of the musician?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And so of all other things;—justice is useful when they are useless,
      and useless when they are useful?
    </p>
<p>
      That is the inference.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage333E">E</a></span>Then justice is not good for much. But let us consider this further point:
      Is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in any kind of
      fighting best able to ward off a blow?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping<a href="#Footnotebook12" id="FnAnchorbook12" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">2</span></a> from a disease is
      best able to create one?
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook12"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook12" class="pginternal">2</a></span> Reading  <span class="transl" title="phula/xasthai kai\ lathei=n, ou(=tos, ktl">φυλάξασθαι καὶ λαθεῖν, οὗτος, κτλ</span>.</p></div>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">A new point of view: Is not he who is best able to do good best able to do evil?</span>
      And he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage334A">334</a></span>steal a march upon
      the enemy?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief?
    </p>
<p>
      That, I suppose, is to be inferred.
    </p>
<p>
      Then if the just man is good at keeping money, he is good at stealing it.
    </p>
<p>
      That is implied in the argument.
    </p>
<p>
      Then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief. And this is a
      lesson which I suspect you must have learnt out of Homer; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage334B">B</a></span>for he, speaking
      of Autolycus, the maternal grandfather of Odysseus, who is a favourite of
      his, affirms that
    </p>
<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="noind">
      ‘He was excellent above all men in theft and perjury.’
    </p></div></div>
<p class="noind">
      And so, you and Homer and Simonides are agreed that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page10"></a>10</span> justice is an art of
      theft; to be practised however ‘for the good of friends and for the harm
      of enemies,’—that was what you were saying?
    </p>
<p>
      No, certainly not that, though I do not now know what I did say; but I
      still stand by the latter words.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage334C">C</a></span>Well, there is another question: By friends and enemies do we mean those
      who are so really, or only in seeming?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Justice an art of theft to be practised for the good of friends and the harm of enemies. But who are friends and enemies?</span>
      Surely, he said, a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks good,
      and to hate those whom he thinks evil.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, but do not persons often err about good and evil: many who are not
      good seem to be so, and conversely?
    </p>
<p>
      That is true.
    </p>
<p>
      Then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their friends?
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage334D">D</a></span>evil to
      the good?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      But the good are just and would not do an injustice?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      Then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do no
      wrong?
    </p>
<p>
      Nay, Socrates; the doctrine is immoral.
    </p>
<p>
      Then I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the
      unjust?
    </p>
<p>
      I like that better.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Mistakes will sometimes happen.</span>
      But see the consequence:—Many a man who is ignorant of human nature
      has friends who are bad friends, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage334E">E</a></span>and in that case he ought to do harm to
      them; and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit; but, if so, we
      shall be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed to be the
      meaning of Simonides.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said: and I think that we had better correct an error into
      which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words ‘friend’ and ‘enemy.’
    </p>
<p>
      What was the error, Polemarchus? I asked.
    </p>
<p>
      We assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought good.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Correction of the definition.<br>To appearance we
must add reality. He is a friend who ‘is’ as well as ‘seems’ good, And
we should do good to our good friends and harm to our bad enemies.</span>
      And how is the error to be corrected?
    </p>
<p>We should rather say that he is a friend who is, as well as <span class="pagenum"><a id="page11"></a>11</span> seems, good;
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage335A">335</a></span>and that he who seems only, and is not good, only seems to be and is not a
      friend; and of an enemy the same may be said.
    </p>
<p>
      You would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our enemies?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And instead of saying simply as we did at first, that it is just to do
      good to our friends and harm to our enemies, we should further say: It is
      just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our enemies
      when they are evil?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage335B">B</a></span>Yes, that appears to me to be the truth.
    </p>
<p>
      But ought the just to injure any one at all?
    </p>
<p>
      Undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his enemies.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="sidenote">To harm men is to injure them; and to injure them is to make them unjust. But justice cannot produce injustice.</span>

      When horses are injured, are they improved or deteriorated?
    </p>
<p>
      The latter.
    </p>
<p>
      Deteriorated, that is to say, in the good qualities of horses, not of
      dogs?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, of horses.
    </p>
<p>
      And dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, and not of
      horses?
    </p>
<p>
      Of course.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage335C">C</a></span>And will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is the
      proper virtue of man?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And that human virtue is justice?
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure.
    </p>
<p>
      Then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust?
    </p>
<p>
      That is the result.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Illustrations.</span>
      But can the musician by his art make men unmusical?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      Or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen?
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage335D">D</a></span>generally, can
      the good by virtue make them bad?
    </p>
<p>
      Assuredly not.
    </p>
<p>
      Any more than heat can produce cold?
    </p>
<p>
      It cannot.
    </p>
<p>
      Or drought moisture? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page12"></a>12</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, P<span class="smcap">OLEMARCHUS</span>, T<span class="smcap">HRASYMACHUS</span>.</span>
      Clearly not.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor can the good harm any one?
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      And the just is the good?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man, but
      of the opposite, who is the unjust?
    </p>
<p>
      I think that what you say is quite true, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage335E">E</a></span>Then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts, and
      that good is the debt which a just man owes to his friends, and evil the
      debt which he owes to his enemies,—to say this is not wise; for it
      is not true, if, as has been clearly shown, the injuring of another can be
      in no case just.
    </p>
<p>
      I agree with you, said Polemarchus.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The saying however explained is not to be attributed to any good or wise man.</span>
      Then you and I are prepared to take up arms against any one who attributes
      such a saying to Simonides or Bias or Pittacus, or any other wise man or
      seer?
    </p>
<p>
      I am quite ready to do battle at your side, he said.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage336A">336</a></span>Shall I tell you whose I believe the saying to be?
    </p>
<p>
      Whose?
    </p>
<p>
      I believe that Periander or Perdiccas or Xerxes or Ismenias the Theban, or
      some other rich and mighty man, who had a great opinion of his own power,
      was the first to say that justice is ‘doing good to your friends and harm
      to your enemies.’
    </p>
<p>
      Most true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said; but if this definition of justice also breaks down, what
      other can be offered?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The brutality of Thrasymachus.</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage336B">B</a></span>Several times in the course of the discussion Thrasymachus had made an
      attempt to get the argument into his own hands, and had been put down by
      the rest of the company, who wanted to hear the end. But when Polemarchus
      and I had done speaking and there was a pause, he could no longer hold his
      peace; and, gathering himself up, he came at us like a wild beast, seeking
      to devour us. We were quite panic-stricken at the sight of him.
    </p>
<p>
      He roared out to the whole company: What folly, Socrates, has taken
      possession of you all? <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage336C">C</a></span>And why, sillybillies, do you knock under to one
      another? I say that if you want really to know what justice is, you should
      not only ask but <span class="pagenum"><a id="page13"></a>13</span><span class="sidenote">S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, T<span class="smcap">HRASYMACHUS</span>.</span> answer, and you should not seek honour to yourself from
      the refutation of an opponent, but have your own answer; for there is many
      a one who can ask and cannot answer. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage336D">D</a></span>And now I will not have you say that
      justice is duty or advantage or profit or gain or interest, for this sort
      of nonsense will not do for me; I must have clearness and accuracy.
    </p>
<p>
      I was panic-stricken at his words, and could not look at him without
      trembling. Indeed I believe that if I had not fixed my eye upon him, I
      should have been struck dumb: but when I saw his fury rising, I looked at
      him first, and was <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage336E">E</a></span>therefore able to reply to him.
    </p>
<p>
      Thrasymachus, I said, with a quiver, don’t be hard upon us. Polemarchus
      and I may have been guilty of a little mistake in the argument, but I can
      assure you that the error was not intentional. If we were seeking for a
      piece of gold, you would not imagine that we were ‘knocking under to one
      another,’ and so losing our chance of finding it. And why, when we are
      seeking for justice, a thing more precious than many pieces of gold, do
      you say that we are weakly yielding to one another and not doing our
      utmost to get at the truth? Nay, my good friend, we are most willing and
      anxious to do so, but the fact is that we cannot. And if so, you people
      who know all things should pity us and not be angry with us.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage337A">337</a></span>How characteristic of Socrates! he replied, with a bitter laugh;—that’s
      your ironical style! Did I not foresee—have I not already told you,
      that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer, and try irony or any
      other shuffle, in order that he might avoid answering?<span class="sidenote">Socrates cannot give any answer if all true answers are excluded.<br>Thrasymachus is assailed with his own weapons.</span>
</p>
<p>
      You are a philosopher, Thrasymachus, I replied, and well know that if you
      ask a person what numbers make up twelve, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage337B">B</a></span>taking care to prohibit him whom
      you ask from answering twice six, or three times four, or six times two,
      or four times three, ‘for this sort of nonsense will not do for me,’—then
      obviously, if that is your way of putting the question, no one can answer
      you. But suppose that he were to retort, ‘Thrasymachus, what do you mean?
      If one of these numbers which you interdict be the true answer to the
      question, am I falsely to say some other number which is not the right
      one?—is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage337C">C</a></span>that your meaning?’—How would you answer him?
    </p>
<p>
      Just as if the two cases were at all alike! he said. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page14"></a>14</span><span class="sidenote">S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, T<span class="smcap">HRASYMACHUS</span>, G<span class="smcap">LAUCON</span>.</span>
</p>
<p>
      Why should they not be? I replied; and even if they are not, but only
      appear to be so to the person who is asked, ought he not to say what he
      thinks, whether you and I forbid him or not?
    </p>
<p>
      I presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted answers?
    </p>
<p>
      I dare say that I may, notwithstanding the danger, if upon reflection I
      approve of any of them.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage337D">D</a></span>But what if I give you an answer about justice other and better, he said,
      than any of these? What do you deserve to have done to you?

      is what I deserve to have done to me.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The Sophist demands payment for his instructions. The company are very willing to contribute.</span>
      What, and no payment! a pleasant notion!
    </p>
<p>
      I will pay when I have the money, I replied.
    </p>
<p>
      But you have, Socrates, said Glaucon: and you, Thrasymachus, need be under
      no anxiety about money, for we will all make a contribution for Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage337E">E</a></span>Yes, he replied, and then Socrates will do as he always does—refuse
      to answer himself, but take and pull to pieces the answer of some one
      else.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Socrates knows little or nothing: how can he answer? And he is deterred by the interdict of Thrasymachus.</span>
      Why, my good friend, I said, how can any one answer who knows, and says
      that he knows, just nothing; and who, even if he has some faint notions of
      his own, is told by a man of authority not to utter them? The natural
      thing is, that <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage338A">338</a></span>the speaker should be some one like yourself who professes
      to know and can tell what he knows. Will you then kindly answer, for the
      edification of the company and of myself?
    </p>
<p>
      Glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request, and
      Thrasymachus, as any one might see, was in reality eager to speak; for he
      thought that he had an excellent answer, and would distinguish himself.
      But at first he affected to insist on my answering; at length he consented
      to begin. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage338B">B</a></span>Behold, he said, the wisdom of Socrates; he refuses to teach
      himself, and goes about learning of others, to whom he never even says
      Thank you.
    </p>
<p>
      That I learn of others, I replied, is quite true; but that I am ungrateful
      I wholly deny. Money I have none, and therefore I pay in praise, which is
      all I have; and how ready <span class="pagenum"><a id="page15"></a>15</span><span class="sidenote">S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, T<span class="smcap">HRASYMACHUS</span>.</span> I am to praise any one who appears to me to
      speak well you will very soon find out when you answer; for I expect that
      you will answer well.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The definition of Thrasymachus: ‘Justice is the interest of the stronger or ruler.’</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage338C">C</a></span>Listen, then, he said; I proclaim that justice is nothing else than the
      interest of the stronger. And now why do you not praise me? But of course
      you won’t.
    </p>
<p>
      Let me first understand you, I replied. Justice, as you say, is the
      interest of the stronger. What, Thrasymachus, is the meaning of this? You
      cannot mean to say that because Polydamas, the pancratiast, is stronger
      than we are, and finds the eating of beef conducive to his bodily
      strength, that to <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage338D">D</a></span>eat beef is therefore equally for our good who are
      weaker than he is, and right and just for us?
    </p>
<p>
      That’s abominable of you, Socrates; you take the words in the sense which
      is most damaging to the argument.
    </p>
<p>
      Not at all, my good sir, I said; I am trying to understand them; and I
      wish that you would be a little clearer.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, he said, have you never heard that forms of government differ; there
      are tyrannies, and there are democracies, and there are aristocracies?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I know.
    </p>
<p>
      And the government is the ruling power in each state?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Socrates compels Thrasymachus to explain his meaning.</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage338E">E</a></span>And the different forms of government make laws democratical,
      aristocratical, tyrannical, with a view to their several interests; and
      these laws, which are made by them for their own interests, are the
      justice which they deliver to their subjects, and him who transgresses
      them they punish as a breaker of the law, and unjust. And that is what I
      mean when I say that in all states there is the same principle of justice,
      which is the interest of the government; and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage339A">339</a></span>as the government must be
      supposed to have power, the only reasonable conclusion is, that everywhere
      there is one principle of justice, which is the interest of the stronger.
    </p>
<p>
      Now I understand you, I said; and whether you are right or not I will try
      to discover. But let me remark, that in defining justice you have yourself
      used the word ‘interest’ which you forbade me to use. It is true, however,
      that in your definition the words ‘of the stronger’ are added.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage339B">B</a></span>A small addition, you must allow, he said. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page16"></a>16</span>
</p>
<p>
      Great or small, never mind about that: we must first enquire whether what
      you are saying is the truth. Now we are both agreed that justice is
      interest of some sort, but you go on to say ‘of the stronger’; about this
      addition I am not so sure, and must therefore consider further.
    </p>
<p>
      Proceed.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">He is dissatisfied with the explanation; for rulers may err.</span>
      I will; and first tell me, Do you admit that it is just for subjects to
      obey their rulers?
    </p>
<p>
      I do.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage339C">C</a></span>But are the rulers of states absolutely infallible, or are they sometimes
      liable to err?
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure, he replied, they are liable to err.
    </p>
<p>
      Then in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly, and
      sometimes not?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      When they make them rightly, they make them agreeably to their interest;
      when they are mistaken, contrary to their interest; you admit that?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects,—and
      that is what you call justice?
    </p>
<p>
      Doubtless.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">And then the justice which makes a mistake will turn out to be the reverse of the interest of the stronger.</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage339D">D</a></span>Then justice, according to your argument, is not only obedience to the
      interest of the stronger but the reverse?
    </p>
<p>
      What is that you are saying? he asked.
    </p>
<p>
      I am only repeating what you are saying, I believe. But let us consider:
      Have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own
      interest in what they command, and also that to obey them is justice? Has
      not that been admitted?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage339E">E</a></span>Then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest of
      the stronger, when the rulers unintentionally command things to be done
      which are to their own injury. For if, as you say, justice is the
      obedience which the subject renders to their commands, in that case, O
      wisest of men, is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker are
      commanded to do, not what is for the interest, but what is for the injury
      of the stronger?
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing can be clearer, Socrates, said Polemarchus. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page17"></a>17</span><span class="sidenote">S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, C<span class="smcap">LEITOPHON</span>, P<span class="smcap">OLEMARCHUS</span>, T<span class="smcap">HRASYMACHUS</span>.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage340A">340</a></span>Yes, said Cleitophon, interposing, if you are allowed to be his witness.
    </p>
<p>
      But there is no need of any witness, said Polemarchus, for Thrasymachus
      himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not for
      their own interest, and that for subjects to obey them is justice.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Cleitophon tries to make a way of escape for Thrasymachus by inserting the words ‘thought to be.’</span>
      Yes, Polemarchus,—Thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what was
      commanded by their rulers is just.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, Cleitophon, but he also said that justice is the interest <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage340B">B</a></span>of the
      stronger, and, while admitting both these propositions, he further
      acknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his subjects
      to do what is not for his own interest; whence follows that justice is the
      injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger.
    </p>
<p>
      But, said Cleitophon, he meant by the interest of the stronger what the
      stronger thought to be his interest,—this was what the weaker had to
      do; and this was affirmed by him to be justice.
    </p>
<p>
      Those were not his words, rejoined Polemarchus.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage340C">C</a></span>Never mind, I replied, if he now says that they are, let us accept his
      statement. Tell me, Thrasymachus, I said, did you mean by justice what the
      stronger thought to be his interest, whether really so or not?<span class="sidenote">This evasion is repudiated by Thrasymachus;</span>
</p>
<p>
      Certainly not, he said. Do you suppose that I call him who is mistaken the
      stronger at the time when he is mistaken?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, my impression was that you did so, when you admitted that the
      ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken.<span class="sidenote">who adopts another line of defence: ‘No artist or ruler is ever mistaken <i>qua</i> artist or ruler.’</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage340D">D</a></span>You argue like an informer, Socrates. Do you mean, for example, that he
      who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken? or
      that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or
      grammarian at the time when he is making the mistake, in respect of the
      mistake? True, we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian
      has made a mistake, but this is only a way of speaking; for the fact is
      that neither the grammarian nor any other person of skill ever makes a
      mistake in so far as he is what his name implies; they none of them err
      unless their skill fails them, and then they cease to be skilled artists.
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page18"></a>18</span><span class="sidenote">S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, T<span class="smcap">HRASYMACHUS</span>.</span> No artist or sage or ruler errs at the time when he is what his name
      implies; though he is commonly said to err, and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage340E">E</a></span>I adopted the common mode
      of speaking. But to be perfectly accurate, since you are such a lover of
      accuracy, we should say that the ruler, in so far as he is a ruler, is
      unerring, and, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage341A">341</a></span>being unerring, always commands that which is for his own
      interest; and the subject is required to execute his commands; and
      therefore, as I said at first and now repeat, justice is the interest of
      the stronger.
    </p>
<p>
      Indeed, Thrasymachus, and do I really appear to you to argue like an
      informer?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And do you suppose that I ask these questions with any design of injuring
      you in the argument?
    </p>
<p>
      Nay, he replied, ‘suppose’ is not the word—I know it; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage341B">B</a></span>but you will
      be found out, and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail.
    </p>
<p>
      I shall not make the attempt, my dear man; but to avoid any
      misunderstanding occurring between us in future, let me ask, in what sense
      do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest, as you were saying, he
      being the superior, it is just that the inferior should execute—is
      he a ruler in the popular or in the strict sense of the term?
    </p>
<p>
      In the strictest of all senses, he said. And now cheat and play the
      informer if you can; I ask no quarter at your hands. But you never will be
      able, never.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The essential meaning of words distinguished from their attributes.</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage341C">C</a></span>And do you imagine, I said, that I am such a madman as to try and cheat,
      Thrasymachus? I might as well shave a lion.
    </p>
<p>
      Why, he said, you made the attempt a minute ago, and you failed.
    </p>
<p>
      Enough, I said, of these civilities. It will be better that I should ask
      you a question: Is the physician, taken in that strict sense of which you
      are speaking, a healer of the sick or a maker of money? And remember that
      I am now speaking of the true physician.
    </p>
<p>
      A healer of the sick, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And the pilot—that is to say, the true pilot—is he a captain
      of sailors or a mere sailor?
    </p>
<p>
      A captain of sailors. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page19"></a>19</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage341D">D</a></span>The circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into
      account; neither is he to be called a sailor; the name pilot by which he
      is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing, but is significant of his
      skill and of his authority over the sailors.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, I said, every art has an interest?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      For which the art has to consider and provide?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, that is the aim of art.
    </p>
<p>
      And the interest of any art is the perfection of it—this and nothing
      else?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage341E">E</a></span>What do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      I mean what I may illustrate negatively by the example of the body.
      Suppose you were to ask me whether the body is self-sufficing or has
      wants, I should reply: Certainly the body has wants; for the body may be
      ill and require to be cured, and has therefore interests to which the art
      of medicine ministers; and this is the origin and intention of medicine,
      as you will acknowledge. Am I not right?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage342A">342</a></span>Quite right, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Art has no imperfection to be corrected, and therefore no extraneous interest.</span>
      But is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in any
      quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the ear
      fail of hearing, and therefore requires another art to provide for the
      interests of seeing and hearing—has art in itself, I say, any
      similar liability to fault or defect, and does every art require another
      supplementary art to provide for its interests, and that another and
      another without end? Or have the arts to look only <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage342B">B</a></span>after their own
      interests? Or have they no need either of themselves or of another?—having
      no faults or defects, they have no need to correct them, either by the
      exercise of their own art or of any other; they have only to consider the
      interest of their subject-matter. For every art remains pure and faultless
      while remaining true—that is to say, while perfect and unimpaired.
      Take the words in your precise sense, and tell me whether I am not right.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, clearly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Illustrations.</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage342C">C</a></span>Then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine, but the interest
      of the body? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page20"></a>20</span>
</p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art of
      horsemanship, but the interests of the horse; neither do any other arts
      care for themselves, for they have no needs; they care only for that which
      is the subject of their art?
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      But surely, Thrasymachus, the arts are the superiors and rulers of their
      own subjects?
    </p>
<p>
      To this he assented with a good deal of reluctance.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, I said, no science or art considers or enjoins the interest of the
      stronger or superior, but only the interest of the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage342D">D</a></span>subject and weaker?
    </p>
<p>
      He made an attempt to contest this proposition also, but finally
      acquiesced.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, I continued, no physician, in so far as he is a physician, considers
      his own good in what he prescribes, but the good of his patient; for the
      true physician is also a ruler having the human body as a subject, and is
      not a mere money-maker; that has been admitted?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And the pilot likewise, in the strict sense of the term, is a ruler of
      sailors and not a mere sailor?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage342E">E</a></span>That has been admitted.
    </p>
<p>
      And such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest of
      the sailor who is under him, and not for his own or the ruler’s interest?
    </p>
<p>
      He gave a reluctant ‘Yes.’
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The disinterestedness of rulers.</span>
      Then, I said, Thrasymachus, there is no one in any rule who, in so far as
      he is a ruler, considers or enjoins what is for his own interest, but
      always what is for the interest of his subject or suitable to his art; to
      that he looks, and that alone he considers in everything which he says and
      does.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage343A">343</a></span>When we had got to this point in the argument, and every one saw that the
      definition of justice had been completely upset, Thrasymachus, instead of
      replying to me, said: Tell me, Socrates, have you got a nurse?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The impudence of Thrasymachus.</span>
      Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be
      answering?
    </p>
<p>
      Because she leaves you to snivel, and never wipes your <span class="pagenum"><a id="page21"></a>21</span> nose: she has not
      even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep.
    </p>
<p>
      What makes you say that? I replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Thrasymachus dilates upon the advantages of injustice,</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage343B">B</a></span>Because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens or tends the sheep
      or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of himself or
      his master; and you further imagine that the rulers of states, if they are
      true rulers, never think of their subjects as sheep, and that they are not
      studying their own advantage day and night. Oh, no; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage343C">C</a></span>and so entirely astray
      are you in your ideas about the just and unjust as not even to know that
      justice and the just are in reality another’s good; that is to say, the
      interest of the ruler and stronger, and the loss of the subject and
      servant; and injustice the opposite; for the unjust is lord over the truly
      simple and just: he is the stronger, and his subjects do what is for his
      interest, and minister to his <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage343D">D</a></span>happiness, which is very far from being
      their own. Consider further, most foolish Socrates, that the just is
      always a loser in comparison with the unjust. First of all, in private
      contracts: wherever the unjust is the partner of the just you will find
      that, when the partnership is dissolved, the unjust man has always more
      and the just less. Secondly, in their dealings with the State: when there
      is an income-tax, the just man will pay more and the unjust less on the
      same amount of income; and when there is anything to be <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage343E">E</a></span>received the one
      gains nothing and the other much. <span class="sidenote">especially when pursued on a great scale.</span>Observe also what happens when they take
      an office; there is the just man neglecting his affairs and perhaps
      suffering other losses, and getting nothing out of the public, because he
      is just; moreover he is hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing
      to serve them in unlawful ways. But all this is reversed in the case of
      the unjust man. I am speaking, as before, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage344A">344</a></span>of injustice on a large scale in
      which the advantage of the unjust is most apparent; and my meaning will be
      most clearly seen if we turn to that highest form of injustice in which
      the criminal is the happiest of men, and the sufferers or those who refuse
      to do injustice are the most miserable—that is to say tyranny, <span class="sidenote">Tyranny.</span>which
      by fraud and force takes away the property of others, not little by little
      but wholesale; comprehending in one, things sacred as well as profane,
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage344B">B</a></span>private <span class="pagenum"><a id="page22"></a>22</span> and public; for which acts of wrong, if he were detected
      perpetrating any one of them singly, he would be punished and incur great
      disgrace—they who do such wrong in particular cases are called
      robbers of temples, and man-stealers and burglars and swindlers and
      thieves. But when a man besides taking away the money of the citizens has
      made slaves of them, then, instead of these names of reproach, he <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage344C">C</a></span>is
      termed happy and blessed, not only by the citizens but by all who hear of
      his having achieved the consummation of injustice. For mankind censure
      injustice, fearing that they may be the victims of it and not because they
      shrink from committing it. And thus, as I have shown, Socrates, injustice,
      when on a sufficient scale, has more strength and freedom and mastery than
      justice; and, as I said at first, justice is the interest of the stronger,
      whereas injustice is a man’s own profit and interest.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Thrasymachus having made his speech wants to run away, but is detained by the company.</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage344D">D</a></span>Thrasymachus, when he had thus spoken, having, like a bath-man, deluged
      our ears with his words, had a mind to go away. But the company would not
      let him; they insisted that he should remain and defend his position; and
      I myself added my own humble request that he would not leave us.
      Thrasymachus, I said to him, excellent man, how suggestive are your
      remarks! And are you going to run away before you have fairly taught or
      learned whether they are true or not? <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage344E">E</a></span>Is the attempt to determine the way
      of man’s life so small a matter in your eyes—to determine how life
      may be passed by each one of us to the greatest advantage?
    </p>
<p>
      And do I differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the enquiry?
    </p>
<p>
      You appear rather, I replied, to have no care or thought about us,
      Thrasymachus—whether we live better or worse from not knowing what
      you say you know, is to you a matter of indifference. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage345A">345</a></span>Prithee, friend, do
      not keep your knowledge to yourself; we are a large party; and any benefit
      which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded. For my own part I openly
      declare that I am not convinced, and that I do not believe injustice to be
      more gainful than justice, even if uncontrolled and allowed to have free
      play. For, granting that there may be an unjust man who is able to commit
      injustice either by fraud or force, still this does not convince me of the
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page23"></a>23</span> superior advantage of injustice, and there may be others who are in the
      same predicament with myself. Perhaps we may be wrong; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage345B">B</a></span>if so, you in your
      wisdom should convince us that we are mistaken in preferring justice to
      injustice.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The swagger of Thrasymachus.</span>
      And how am I to convince you, he said, if you are not already convinced by
      what I have just said; what more can I do for you? Would you have me put
      the proof bodily into your souls?
    </p>
<p>
      Heaven forbid! I said; I would only ask you to be consistent; or, if you
      change, change openly and let there be no deception. For I must remark,
      Thrasymachus, if you will <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage345C">C</a></span>recall what was previously said, that although
      you began by defining the true physician in an exact sense, you did not
      observe a like exactness when speaking of the shepherd; you thought that
      the shepherd as a shepherd tends the sheep not with a view to their own
      good, but like a mere diner or banquetter with a view to the pleasures of
      the table; or, again, as a trader for sale in the market, and not as a
      shepherd. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage345D">D</a></span>Yet surely the art of the shepherd is concerned only with the
      good of his subjects; he has only to provide the best for them, since the
      perfection of the art is already ensured whenever all the requirements of
      it are satisfied. And that was what I was saying just now about the ruler.
      I conceived that the art of the ruler, considered as ruler, whether in a
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage345E">E</a></span>state or in private life, could only regard the good of his flock or
      subjects; whereas you seem to think that the rulers in states, that is to
      say, the true rulers, like being in authority.
    </p>
<p>
      Think! Nay, I am sure of it.
    </p>
<p>
      Then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly
      without payment, unless under the idea that <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage346A">346</a></span>they govern for the advantage
      not of themselves but of others? <span class="sidenote">The arts have different functions and are not to be confounded with the art of payment which is common to them all.</span>Let me ask you a question: Are not the
      several arts different, by reason of their each having a separate
      function? And, my dear illustrious friend, do say what you think, that we
      may make a little progress.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, that is the difference, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general one—medicine,
      for example, gives us health; navigation, safety at sea, and so on?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page24"></a>24</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage346B">B</a></span>And the art of payment has the special function of giving pay: but we do
      not confuse this with other arts, any more than the art of the pilot is to
      be confused with the art of medicine, because the health of the pilot may
      be improved by a sea voyage. You would not be inclined to say, would you,
      that navigation is the art of medicine, at least if we are to adopt your
      exact use of language?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      Or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not say
      that the art of payment is medicine?
    </p>
<p>
      I should not.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because a man
      takes fees when he is engaged in healing?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage346C">C</a></span>Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      And we have admitted, I said, that the good of each art is specially
      confined to the art?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, if there be any good which all artists have in common, that is to be
      attributed to something of which they all have the common use?
    </p>
<p>
      True, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is gained
      by an additional use of the art of pay, which is not the art professed by
      him?
    </p>
<p>
      He gave a reluctant assent to this.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage346D">D</a></span>Then the pay is not derived by the several artists from their respective
      arts. But the truth is, that while the art of medicine gives health, and
      the art of the builder builds a house, another art attends them which is
      the art of pay. The various arts may be doing their own business and
      benefiting that over which they preside, but would the artist receive any
      benefit from his art unless he were paid as well?
    </p>
<p>
      I suppose not.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage346E">E</a></span>But does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he confers a benefit.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The true ruler or artist seeks, not his own advantage, but the perfection of his art; and therefore he must be paid.</span>
      Then now, Thrasymachus, there is no longer any doubt that neither arts nor
      governments provide for their own interests; but, as we were before
      saying, they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects who are
      the weaker <span class="pagenum"><a id="page25"></a>25</span> and not the stronger—to their good they attend and not to
      the good of the superior. And this is the reason, my dear Thrasymachus,
      why, as I was just now saying, no one is willing to govern; because no one
      likes to take in hand the reformation of evils which are not his concern
      without remuneration. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage347A">347</a></span>For, in the execution of his work, and in giving his
      orders to another, the true artist does not regard his own interest, but
      always that of his subjects; and therefore in order that rulers may be
      willing to rule, they must be paid in one of three modes of payment,
      money, or honour, or a penalty for refusing.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Three modes of paying rulers, money, honour, and a penalty for refusing to rule.</span>
      What do you mean, Socrates? said Glaucon. The first two modes of payment
      are intelligible enough, but what the penalty is I do not understand, or
      how a penalty can be a payment.
    </p>
<p>
      You mean that you do not understand the nature of this <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage347B">B</a></span>payment which to
      the best men is the great inducement to rule? Of course you know that
      ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And for this reason, I said, money and honour have no attraction for them;
      good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing and so
      to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves out of
      the public revenues to get the name of thieves. And not being ambitious
      they do not care about honour. Wherefore necessity <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage347C">C</a></span>must be laid upon them,
      and they must be induced to serve from the fear of punishment. <span class="sidenote">The penalty is the evil of being ruled by an inferior.</span>And this,
      as I imagine, is the reason why the forwardness to take office, instead of
      waiting to be compelled, has been deemed dishonourable. Now the worst part
      of the punishment is that he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by
      one who is worse than himself. And the fear of this, as I conceive,
      induces the good to take <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage347D">D</a></span>office, not because they would, but because they
      cannot help—not under the idea that they are going to have any
      benefit or enjoyment themselves,<span class="sidenote">In a city composed wholly of good men there would be a great unwillingness to rule.</span> but as a necessity, and because they are
      not able to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better than
      themselves, or indeed as good. For there is reason to think that if a city
      were composed entirely of good men, then to avoid office would be as much
      an object of contention as to obtain office is at present; then we should <span class="pagenum"><a id="page26"></a>26</span>
      have plain proof that the true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his
      own interest, but that of his subjects; and every one who knew this would
      choose rather to receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble
      of conferring one. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage347E">E</a></span>So far am I from agreeing with Thrasymachus that
      justice is the interest of the stronger.<span class="sidenote">Thrasymachus maintains that the life of the unjust is better than the life of the just.</span> This latter question need not be
      further discussed at present; but when Thrasymachus says that the life of
      the unjust is more advantageous than that of the just, his new statement
      appears to me to be of a far more serious character. Which of us has
      spoken truly? And which sort of life, Glaucon, do you prefer?
    </p>
<p>
      I for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous, he
      answered.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, G<span class="smcap">LAUCON</span>, T<span class="smcap">HRASYMACHUS</span>.</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage348A">348</a></span>Did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which Thrasymachus was
      rehearsing?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I heard him, he replied, but he has not convinced me.
    </p>
<p>
      Then shall we try to find some way of convincing him, if we can, that he
      is saying what is not true?
    </p>
<p>
      Most certainly, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      If, I said, he makes a set speech and we make another recounting all the
      advantages of being just, and he answers and we rejoin, there must be a
      numbering and measuring <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage348B">B</a></span>of the goods which are claimed on either side, and
      in the end we shall want judges to decide; but if we proceed in our
      enquiry as we lately did, by making admissions to one another, we shall
      unite the offices of judge and advocate in our own persons.
    </p>
<p>
      Very good, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And which method do I understand you to prefer? I said.
    </p>
<p>
      That which you propose.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, then, Thrasymachus, I said, suppose you begin at the beginning and
      answer me. You say that perfect injustice is more gainful than perfect
      justice?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage348C">C</a></span>Yes, that is what I say, and I have given you my reasons.
    </p>
<p>
      And what is your view about them? Would you call one of them virtue and
      the other vice?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">A paradox still more extreme, that injustice is virtue,</span>
      I suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice?
    </p>
<p>
      What a charming notion! So likely too, seeing that I affirm injustice to
      be profitable and justice not. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page27"></a>27</span>
</p>
<p>
      What else then would you say?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, T<span class="smcap">HRASYMACHUS.</span></span>
      The opposite, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And would you call justice vice?
    </p>
<p>
      No, I would rather say sublime simplicity.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage348D">D</a></span>Then would you call injustice malignity?
    </p>
<p>
      No; I would rather say discretion.
    </p>
<p>
      And do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly
      unjust, and who have the power of subduing states and nations; but perhaps
      you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses. Even this profession if
      undetected has advantages, though they are not to be compared with those
      of which I was just now speaking.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage348E">E</a></span>I do not think that I misapprehend your meaning, Thrasymachus, I replied;
      but still I cannot hear without amazement that you class injustice with
      wisdom and virtue, and justice with the opposite.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly I do so class them.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, I said, you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable ground;
      for if the injustice which you were maintaining to be profitable had been
      admitted by you as by others to be vice and deformity, an answer might
      have been given to you on received principles; but now I perceive that <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage349A">349</a></span>you
      will call injustice honourable and strong, and to the unjust you will
      attribute all the qualities which were attributed by us before to the
      just, seeing that you do not hesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and
      virtue.
    </p>
<p>
      You have guessed most infallibly, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Then I certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the argument
      so long as I have reason to think that you, Thrasymachus, are speaking
      your real mind; for I do believe that you are now in earnest and are not
      amusing yourself at our expense.
    </p>
<p>
      I may be in earnest or not, but what is that to you?—to refute the
      argument is your business.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">refuted by the analogy of the arts.</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage349B">B</a></span>Very true, I said; that is what I have to do: But will you be so good as
      answer yet one more question? Does the just man try to gain any advantage
      over the just?
    </p>
<p>
      Far otherwise; if he did he would not be the simple amusing creature which
      he is. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page28"></a>28</span>
</p>
<p>
      And would he try to go beyond just action?
    </p>
<p>
      He would not.
    </p>
<p>
      And how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the unjust;
      would that be considered by him as just or unjust?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The just tries to obtain an advantage over the unjust, but not over the just; the unjust over both just and unjust.</span>
      He would think it just, and would try to gain the advantage; but he would
      not be able.
    </p>
<p>
      Whether he would or would not be able, I said, is not to the point. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage349C">C</a></span>My
      question is only whether the just man, while refusing to have more than
      another just man, would wish and claim to have more than the unjust?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he would.
    </p>
<p>
      And what of the unjust—does he claim to have more than the just man
      and to do more than is just?
    </p>
<p>
      Of course, he said, for he claims to have more than all men.
    </p>
<p>
      And the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the unjust
      man or action, in order that he may have more than all?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      We may put the matter thus, I said—the just does not desire more
      than his like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more
      than both his like and his unlike?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage349D">D</a></span>Nothing, he said, can be better than that statement.
    </p>
<p>
      And the unjust is good and wise, and the just is neither?
    </p>
<p>
      Good again, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike them?
    </p>
<p>
      Of course, he said, he who is of a certain nature, is like those who are
      of a certain nature; he who is not, not.
    </p>
<p>
      Each of them, I said, is such as his like is?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Illustrations.</span>
      Very good, Thrasymachus, I said; and now to take the case of the arts: you
      would admit that one man is a musician and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage349E">E</a></span>another not a musician?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And which is wise and which is foolish?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly the musician is wise, and he who is not a musician is foolish.
    </p>
<p>
      And he is good in as far as he is wise, and bad in as far as he is
      foolish? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page29"></a>29</span>
</p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And do you think, my excellent friend, that a musician when he adjusts the
      lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the
      tightening and loosening the strings?
    </p>
<p>
      I do not think that he would.
    </p>
<p>
      But he would claim to exceed the non-musician?
    </p>
<p>
      Of course.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage350A">350</a></span>And what would you say of the physician? In prescribing meats and drinks
      would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the practice of
      medicine?
    </p>
<p>
      He would not.
    </p>
<p>
      But he would wish to go beyond the non-physician?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The artist remains within the limits of his art:</span>
      And about knowledge and ignorance in general; see whether you think that
      any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice of saying or
      doing more than another man who has knowledge. Would he not rather say or
      do the same as his like in the same case?
    </p>
<p>
      That, I suppose, can hardly be denied.
    </p>
<p>
      And what of the ignorant? would he not desire to have <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage350B">B</a></span>more than either the
      knowing or the ignorant?
    </p>
<p>
      I dare say.
    </p>
<p>
      And the knowing is wise?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And the wise is good?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like, but
      more than his unlike and opposite?
    </p>
<p>
      I suppose so.
    </p>
<p>
      Whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      But did we not say, Thrasymachus, that the unjust goes beyond both his
      like and unlike? Were not these your words?
    </p>
<p>
      They were.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">and similarly the just man does not exceed the limits of other just men.</span>

      Then the just is like the wise and good, and the unjust like the evil and
      ignorant?
    </p>
<p>
      That is the inference.
    </p>
<p>
      And each of them is such as his like is?
    </p>
<p>
      That was admitted.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust evil and
      ignorant.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Thrasymachus perspiring and even blushing.</span>
      Thrasymachus made all these admissions, not fluently, as <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage350D">D</a></span>I repeat them,
      but with extreme reluctance; it was a hot summer’s day, and the
      perspiration poured from him in torrents; and then I saw what I had never
      seen before, Thrasymachus blushing. As we were now agreed that justice was
      virtue and wisdom, and injustice vice and ignorance, I proceeded to
      another point:
    </p>
<p>
      Well, I said, Thrasymachus, that matter is now settled; but were we not
      also saying that injustice had strength; do you remember?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of what you
      are saying or have no answer; if however I were to answer, you would be
      quite certain to accuse me of haranguing; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage350E">E</a></span>therefore either permit me to
      have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will answer
      ‘Very good,’ as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod ‘Yes’
      and ‘No.’
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not, I said, if contrary to your real opinion.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, I will, to please you, since you will not let me speak. What
      else would you have?
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing in the world, I said; and if you are so disposed I will ask and
      you shall answer.
    </p>
<p>
      Proceed.
    </p>
<p>
      Then I will repeat the question which I asked before, in <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage351A">351</a></span>order that our
      examination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may be carried
      on regularly. A statement was made that injustice is stronger and more
      powerful than justice, but now justice, having been identified with wisdom
      and virtue, is easily shown to be stronger than injustice, if injustice is
      ignorance; this can no longer be questioned by any one. But I want to view
      the matter, Thrasymachus, in a different way: <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage351B">B</a></span>You would not deny that a
      state may be <span class="pagenum"><a id="page31"></a>31</span> unjust and may be unjustly attempting to enslave other
      states, or may have already enslaved them, and may be holding many of them
      in subjection?
    </p>
<p>
      True, he replied; and I will add that the best and most perfectly unjust
      state will be most likely to do so.
    </p>
<p>
      I know, I said, that such was your position; but what I would further
      consider is, whether this power which is possessed by the superior state
      can exist or be exercised without justice or only with justice.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">At this point the temper of Thrasymachus begins to improve. Cp. 5. <a href="#stpage450A" class="pginternal">450 A</a>, 6. <a href="#stpage498C" class="pginternal">498 C</a>.</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage351C">C</a></span>If you are right in your view, and justice is wisdom, then only with
      justice; but if I am right, then without justice.
    </p>
<p>
      I am delighted, Thrasymachus, to see you not only nodding assent and
      dissent, but making answers which are quite excellent.
    </p>
<p>
      That is out of civility to you, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      You are very kind, I said; and would you have the goodness also to inform
      me, whether you think that a state, or an army, or a band of robbers and
      thieves, or any other gang of evil-doers could act at all if they injured
      one another?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage351D">D</a></span>No indeed, he said, they could not.
    </p>
<p>
      But if they abstained from injuring one another, then they might act
      together better?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting,
      and justice imparts harmony and friendship; is not that true,
      Thrasymachus?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Perfect injustice, whether in state or individuals, is destructive to them.</span>
      I agree, he said, because I do not wish to quarrel with you.
    </p>
<p>
      How good of you, I said; but I should like to know also whether injustice,
      having this tendency to arouse hatred, wherever existing, among slaves or
      among freemen, will not make them hate one another and set them at
      variance and render them incapable of common action?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage351E">E</a></span>And even if injustice be found in two only, will they not quarrel and
      fight, and become enemies to one another and to the just?
    </p>
<p>
      They will.
    </p>
<p>
      And suppose injustice abiding in a single person, would your wisdom say
      that she loses or that she retains her natural power? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page32"></a>32</span>
</p>
<p>
      Let us assume that she retains her power.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that
      wherever she takes up her abode, whether in a city, in an army, in a
      family, or in any other body, that body is, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage352A">352</a></span>to begin with, rendered
      incapable of united action by reason of sedition and distraction; and does
      it not become its own enemy and at variance with all that opposes it, and
      with the just? Is not this the case?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person; in
      the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not at
      unity with himself, and in the second place making him an enemy to himself
      and the just? Is not that true, Thrasymachus?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And O my friend, I said, surely the gods are just?
    </p>
<p>
      Granted that they are.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage352B">B</a></span>But if so, the unjust will be the enemy of the gods, and the just will be
      their friend?
    </p>
<p>
      Feast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; I will not
      oppose you, lest I should displease the company.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Recapitulation.</span>
      Well then, proceed with your answers, and let me have the remainder of my
      repast. For we have already shown that the just are clearly wiser and
      better and abler than the unjust, and that the unjust are incapable of
      common action; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage352C">C</a></span>nay more, that to speak as we did of men who are evil
      acting at any time vigorously together, is not strictly true, for if they
      had been perfectly evil, they would have laid hands upon one another; but
      it is evident that there must have been some remnant of justice in them,
      which enabled them to combine; if there had not been they would have
      injured one another as well as their victims; they were but half-villains
      in their enterprises; for had they been whole villains, and utterly
      unjust, they would have been utterly incapable of action. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage352D">D</a></span>That, as I
      believe, is the truth of the matter, and not what you said at first. But
      whether the just have a better and happier life than the unjust is a
      further question which we also proposed to consider. I think that they
      have, and for the reasons which I have given; but still <span class="pagenum"><a id="page33"></a>33</span> I should like to
      examine further, for no light matter is at stake, nothing less than the
      rule of human life.
    </p>
<p>
      Proceed.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Illustrations of ends and excellences preparatory to the enquiry into the end and excellence of the soul.</span>
      I will proceed by asking a question: Would you not say that a horse has
      some end?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage352E">E</a></span>I should.
    </p>
<p>
      And the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could not
      be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other thing?
    </p>
<p>
      I do not understand, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Let me explain: Can you see, except with the eye?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      Or hear, except with the ear?
    </p>
<p>
      No.
    </p>
<p>
      These then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs?
    </p>
<p>
      They may.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage353A">353</a></span>But you can cut off a vine-branch with a dagger or with a chisel, and in
      many other ways?
    </p>
<p>
      Of course.
    </p>
<p>
      And yet not so well as with a pruning-hook made for the purpose?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      May we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook?
    </p>
<p>
      We may.
    </p>
<p>
      Then now I think you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning
      when I asked the question whether the end of anything would be that which
      could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other
      thing?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage353B">B</a></span>I understand your meaning, he said, and assent.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">All things which have ends have also virtues and excellences by which they fulfil those ends.</span>
      And that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence? Need I ask
      again whether the eye has an end?
    </p>
<p>
      It has.
    </p>
<p>
      And has not the eye an excellence?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And the ear has an end and an excellence also?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And the same is true of all other things; they have each of them an end
      and a special excellence?
    </p>
<p>
      That is so.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are <span class="pagenum"><a id="page34"></a>34</span> wanting <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage353C">C</a></span>in their own
      proper excellence and have a defect instead?
    </p>
<p>
      How can they, he said, if they are blind and cannot see?
    </p>
<p>
      You mean to say, if they have lost their proper excellence, which is
      sight; but I have not arrived at that point yet. I would rather ask the
      question more generally, and only enquire whether the things which fulfil
      their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence, and fail of
      fulfilling them by their own defect?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      I might say the same of the ears; when deprived of their own proper
      excellence they cannot fulfil their end?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage353D">D</a></span>And the same observation will apply to all other things?
    </p>
<p>
      I agree.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">And the soul has a virtue and an end—the virtue justice, the end happiness.</span>
      Well; and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil? for
      example, to superintend and command and deliberate and the like. Are not
      these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned to
      any other?
    </p>
<p>
      To no other.
    </p>
<p>
      And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul?
    </p>
<p>
      Assuredly, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And has not the soul an excellence also?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage353E">E</a></span>And can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that
      excellence?
    </p>
<p>
      She cannot.
    </p>
<p>
      Then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent,
      and the good soul a good ruler?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, necessarily.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Hence justice and happiness are necessarily connected.</span>
      And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and
      injustice the defect of the soul?
    </p>
<p>
      That has been admitted.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the just soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust man
      will live ill?
    </p>
<p>
      That is what your argument proves.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage354A">354</a></span>And he who lives well is blessed and happy, and he who lives ill the
      reverse of happy?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the just is happy, and the unjust miserable? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page35"></a>35</span>
</p>
<p>
      So be it.
    </p>
<p>
      But happiness and not misery is profitable.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, my blessed Thrasymachus, injustice can never be more profitable than
      justice.
    </p>
<p>
      Let this, Socrates, he said, be your entertainment at the Bendidea.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Socrates is displeased with himself and with the argument.</span>
      For which I am indebted to you, I said, now that you have grown gentle
      towards me and have left off scolding. Nevertheless, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage354B">B</a></span>I have not been well
      entertained; but that was my own fault and not yours. As an epicure
      snatches a taste of every dish which is successively brought to table, he
      not having allowed himself time to enjoy the one before, so have I gone
      from one subject to another without having discovered what I sought at
      first, the nature of justice. I left that enquiry and turned away to
      consider whether justice is virtue and wisdom or evil and folly; and when
      there arose a further question about the comparative advantages of justice
      and injustice, I could not refrain from passing on to that. And the result
      of the whole discussion has been that I know nothing at all. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage354C">C</a></span>For I know
      not what justice is, and therefore I am not likely to know whether it is
      or is not a virtue, nor can I say whether the just man is happy or
      unhappy.

      W<span class="smcap">ITH</span> these words I was thinking that I had made an end of the discussion;
      but the end, in truth, proved to be only a beginning. For Glaucon, who is
      always the most pugnacious of men, was dissatisfied at Thrasymachus’
      retirement; he wanted to have the battle out. So he said to me: Socrates,
      do you wish really to persuade us, or only to seem <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage357B">B</a></span>to have persuaded us,
      that to be just is always better than to be unjust?
    </p>
<p>
      I should wish really to persuade you, I replied, if I could.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The threefold division of goods.</span>
      Then you certainly have not succeeded. Let me ask you now:—How would
      you arrange goods—are there not some which we welcome for their own
      sakes, and independently of their consequences, as, for example, harmless
      pleasures and enjoyments, which delight us at the time, although nothing
      follows from them?
    </p>
<p>
      I agree in thinking that there is such a class, I replied.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage357C">C</a></span>Is there not also a second class of goods, such as knowledge, sight,
      health, which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for their
      results?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, I said.
    </p>
<p>
      And would you not recognize a third class, such as gymnastic, and the care
      of the sick, and the physician’s art; also the various ways of
      money-making—these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable;
      and no one would choose them <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage357D">D</a></span>for their own sakes, but only for the sake of
      some reward or result which flows from them?
    </p>
<p>
      There is, I said, this third class also. But why do you ask?
    </p>
<p>
      Because I want to know in which of the three classes you would place
      justice?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage358A">358</a></span>In the highest class, I replied,—among those goods which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page37"></a>37</span> he who
      would be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their
      results.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the many are of another mind; they think that justice is to be
      reckoned in the troublesome class, among goods which are to be pursued for
      the sake of rewards and of reputation, but in themselves are disagreeable
      and rather to be avoided.
    </p>
<p>
      I know, I said, that this is their manner of thinking, and that this was
      the thesis which Thrasymachus was maintaining just now, when he censured
      justice and praised injustice. But I am too stupid to be convinced by him.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Three heads of the
 argument:—1. The nature of justice: 2. Justice a necessity, but not a
good: 3. The reasonableness of this notion.</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage358B">B</a></span>I wish, he said, that you would hear me as well as him, and then I shall
      see whether you and I agree. For Thrasymachus seems to me, like a snake,
      to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have been; but
      to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been made
      clear. Setting aside their rewards and results, I want to know what they
      are in themselves, and how they inwardly work in the soul. If you please,
      then, I will revive the argument of Thrasymachus. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage358C">C</a></span>And first I will speak
      of the nature and origin of justice according to the common view of them.
      Secondly, I will show that all men who practise justice do so against
      their will, of necessity, but not as a good. And thirdly, I will argue
      that there is reason in this view, for the life of the unjust is after all
      better far than the life of the just—if what they say is true,
      Socrates, since I myself am not of their opinion. But still I acknowledge
      that I am perplexed when I hear the voices of Thrasymachus and myriads of
      others dinning in my ears; and, on the other hand, I have <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage358D">D</a></span>never yet heard
      the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in a
      satisfactory way. I want to hear justice praised in respect of itself;
      then I shall be satisfied, and you are the person from whom I think that I
      am most likely to hear this; and therefore I will praise the unjust life
      to the utmost of my power, and my manner of speaking will indicate the
      manner in which I desire to hear you too praising justice and censuring
      injustice. Will you say whether you approve of my proposal?
    </p>
<p>
      Indeed I do; nor can I imagine any theme about which a man of sense would
      oftener wish to converse. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page38"></a>38</span> <span class="sidenote">G<span class="smcap">LAUCON</span>.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage358E">E</a></span>I am delighted, he replied, to hear you say so, and shall begin by
      speaking, as I proposed, of the nature and origin of justice.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Justice a compromise between doing and suffering evil.</span>
      They say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice,
      evil; but that the evil is greater than the good. And so when men have
      both done and suffered injustice and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage359A">359</a></span>have had experience of both, not
      being able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they had
      better agree among themselves to have neither; hence there arise laws and
      mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law is termed by them
      lawful and just. This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice;—it
      is a mean or compromise, between the best of all, which is to do injustice
      and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to suffer injustice
      without the power of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point
      between the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil, and
      honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage359B">B</a></span>For no man who
      is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he
      were able to resist; he would be mad if he did. Such is the received
      account, Socrates, of the nature and origin of justice.

<p>
      Now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they
      have not the power to be unjust will best appear <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage359C">C</a></span>if we imagine something
      of this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust power to do
      what they will, let us watch and see whither desire will lead them; then
      we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be proceeding
      along the same road, following their interest, which all natures deem to
      be their good, and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force
      of law. The liberty which we are supposing may be most completely given to
      them in the form of such a power as is said to have been <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage359D">D</a></span>possessed by
      Gyges, the ancestor of Croesus the Lydian<a href="#Footnotebook21" id="FnAnchorbook21" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">1</span></a>. <span class="sidenote">The story of Gyges.</span>According to the tradition,
      Gyges was a shepherd in the service of the king of Lydia; there was a
      great storm, and an earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place
      where he was feeding his flock. Amazed at the sight, he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page39"></a>39</span> descended into the
      opening, where, among other marvels, he beheld a hollow brazen horse,
      having doors, at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of
      stature, as appeared to him, more than human, and having nothing on but a
      gold ring; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage359E">E</a></span>this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended. Now
      the shepherds met together, according to custom, that they might send
      their monthly report about the flocks to the king; into their assembly he
      came having the ring on his finger, and as he was sitting among them he
      chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand, when instantly he
      became invisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him
      as if he were no longer present. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage360A">360</a></span>He was astonished at this, and again
      touching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared; he made
      several trials of the ring, and always with the same result—when he
      turned the collet inwards he became invisible, when outwards he
      reappeared. Whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers who
      were sent to the court; where as soon as he arrived <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage360B">B</a></span>he seduced the queen,
      and with her help conspired against the king and slew him, and took the
      kingdom. <span class="sidenote">The application of the story of Gyges.</span>Suppose now that there were two such magic rings, and the just
      put on one of them and the unjust the other; no man can be imagined to be
      of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice. No man would
      keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage360C">C</a></span>liked out of the market, or go into houses and lie with any one at his
      pleasure, or kill or release from prison whom he would, and in all
      respects be like a God among men. Then the actions of the just would be as
      the actions of the unjust; they would both come at last to the same point.
      And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just, not
      willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him
      individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks that he can
      safely be unjust, there he is unjust. For <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage360D">D</a></span>all men believe in their hearts
      that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice, and
      he who argues as I have been supposing, will say that they are right. If
      you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible, and
      never doing any wrong or touching what was another’s, he would be thought
      by the lookers-on to be a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page40"></a>40</span> most wretched idiot, although they would praise
      him to one another’s faces, and keep up appearances with one another from
      a fear that they too might suffer injustice. Enough of this.

<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage360E">E</a></span>Now, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and unjust,
      we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the isolation to
      be effected? I answer: Let the unjust man be entirely unjust, and the just
      man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away from either of them, and
      both are to be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective lives.
      <span class="sidenote">The unjust to be clothed with power and reputation.</span>First, let the unjust be like other distinguished masters of craft; like
      the skilful pilot or <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage361A">361</a></span>physician, who knows intuitively his own powers and
      keeps within their limits, and who, if he fails at any point, is able to
      recover himself. So let the unjust make his unjust attempts in the right
      way, and lie hidden if he means to be great in his injustice: (he who is
      found out is nobody:) for the highest reach of injustice is, to be deemed
      just when you are not. Therefore I say that in the perfectly unjust man we
      must assume the most perfect injustice; there is to be no deduction, but
      we must allow him, while doing the most unjust acts, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage361B">B</a></span>to have acquired the
      greatest reputation for justice. If he have taken a false step he must be
      able to recover himself; he must be one who can speak with effect, if any
      of his deeds come to light, and who can force his way where force is
      required by his courage and strength, and command of money and friends.
      And at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity,
      wishing, as Aeschylus says, to be and not to seem good. <span class="sidenote">The just to be unclothed of all but his virtue.</span>There must be no
      seeming, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage361C">C</a></span>for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded, and
      then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or for
      the sake of honours and rewards; therefore, let him be clothed in justice
      only, and have no other covering; and he must be imagined in a state of
      life the opposite of the former. Let him be the best of men, and let him
      be thought the worst; then he will have been put to the proof; and we
      shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of infamy and its
      consequences. And let him continue <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage361D">D</a></span>thus to the hour of death; being just
      and seeming to be unjust. When both have reached the uttermost extreme, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page41"></a>41</span>
      the one of justice and the other of injustice, let judgment be given which
      of them is the happier of the two.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, G<span class="smcap">LAUCON</span>.</span>
      Heavens! my dear Glaucon, I said, how energetically you polish them up for
      the decision, first one and then the other, as if they were two statues.
    </p>
<p>
      I do my best, he said. And now that we know what they are like there is no
      difficulty in tracing out the sort of life <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage361E">E</a></span>which awaits either of them.
      This I will proceed to describe; but as you may think the description a
      little too coarse, I ask you to suppose, Socrates, that the words which
      follow are not mine.—Let me put them into the mouths of the
      eulogists of injustice: They will tell you that the just man who is
      thought unjust will be scourged, racked, bound—will have his eyes
      burnt out; and, at last, after suffering every kind of evil, he will be
      impaled: Then he will understand that he <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage362A">362</a></span>ought to seem only, and not to
      be, just;<span class="sidenote">The just man will learn by each experience that he ought to seem and not to be just.</span> the words of Aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust
      than of the just. For the unjust is pursuing a reality; he does not live
      with a view to appearances—he wants to be really unjust and not to
      seem only:—</p>
<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="noind">
      ‘His mind has a soil deep and fertile,<br>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage362B">B</a></span>Out of which spring his prudent
      counsels.’<a href="#Footnotebook22" id="FnAnchorbook22" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
</p></div></div>
<p class="noind">
      In the first place, he is thought just, and therefore bears rule in the
      city; he can marry whom he will, and give in marriage to whom he will;
      <span class="sidenote">The unjust who appears just will attain every sort of prosperity.</span>also he can trade and deal where he likes, and always to his own
      advantage, because he has no misgivings about injustice; and at every
      contest, whether in public or private, he gets the better of his
      antagonists, and gains at their expense, and is rich, and out of his gains
      he <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage362C">C</a></span>can benefit his friends, and harm his enemies; moreover, he can offer
      sacrifices, and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and magnificently,
      and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to honour in a far better
      style than the just, and therefore he is likely to be dearer than they are
      to the gods. And thus, Socrates, gods and men are said to unite in making
      the life of the unjust better than the life of the just.

<p><span class="sidenote">A<span class="smcap">DEIMANTUS</span>, S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>.</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage362D">D</a></span>I was going to say something in answer to Glaucon, when <span class="pagenum"><a id="page42"></a>42</span> Adeimantus, his
      brother, interposed: Socrates, he said, you do not suppose that there is
      nothing more to be urged?
    </p>
<p>
      Why, what else is there? I answered.
    </p>
<p>
      The strongest point of all has not been even mentioned, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, then, according to the proverb, ‘Let brother help brother’—if
      he fails in any part do you assist him; although I must confess that
      Glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust, and take from
      me the power of helping justice.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">A<span class="smcap">DEIMANTUS</span>.<br>Adeimantus takes up the argument. Justice is praised and injustice blamed, but only out of regard to their consequences.</span><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage362E">E</a></span>Nonsense, he replied. But let me add something more: There is another
side to Glaucon’s argument about the praise and censure of justice
and injustice, which is equally required in order to bring out what I
believe to be his meaning. Parents and tutors are always telling their
sons and their <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage363A">363</a></span>wards that they are to be just; but why? not for the sake
of justice, but for the sake of character and reputation; in the hope of
obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices, marriages,
and the like which Glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing
to the unjust from the reputation of justice. More, however, is made of
appearances by this class of persons than by the others; for they
throw in the good opinion of the gods, and will tell you of a shower of
benefits which the heavens, as they say, rain upon the pious; and this
accords with the testimony of the noble Hesiod and Homer, the first of
whom says, that the gods <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage363B">B</a></span>make the oaks of the just—
</p><div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="noind">
   ‘To bear acorns at their summit, and bees in the middle;<br>
  And the sheep are bowed down with the weight of their fleeces<a href="#Footnotebook23" id="FnAnchorbook23" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">3</span></a>,’</p></div></div>
<p class="noind">and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them. And Homer
has a very similar strain; for he speaks of one whose fame is—
</p><div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="noind">
  ‘As the fame of some blameless king who, like a god,<br>
  Maintains justice; to whom the black earth brings forth<br>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage363C">C</a></span>Wheat and barley, whose trees are bowed with fruit,<br>
  And his sheep never fail to bear, and the sea gives him fish<a href="#Footnotebook24" id="FnAnchorbook24" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">4</span></a>.’</p></div></div>
<p class="noind"><span class="sidenote">The rewards and punishments of another life.</span>Still grander are the gifts of heaven which Musaeus and his son<a href="#Footnotebook25" id="FnAnchorbook25" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">5</span></a> vouchsafe
      to the just; they take them down into the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page43"></a>43</span> world below, where they have the
      saints lying on couches at a feast, everlastingly drunk, crowned with
      garlands; their <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage363D">D</a></span>idea seems to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the
      highest meed of virtue. Some extend their rewards yet further; the
      posterity, as they say, of the faithful and just shall survive to the
      third and fourth generation. This is the style in which they praise
      justice. But about the wicked there is another strain; they bury them in a
      slough in Hades, and make them carry water in a sieve; also while they are
      yet living they bring them to infamy, and inflict <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage363E">E</a></span>upon them the
      punishments which Glaucon described as the portion of the just who are
      reputed to be unjust; nothing else does their invention supply. Such is
      their manner of praising the one and censuring the other.

<p><span class="sidenote">Men are always repeating that virtue is painful and vice pleasant.</span>
      Once more, Socrates, I will ask you to consider another way of speaking
      about justice and injustice, which is not confined to the poets, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage364A">364</a></span>but is
      found in prose writers. The universal voice of mankind is always declaring
      that justice and virtue are honourable, but grievous and toilsome; and
      that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of attainment, and are
      only censured by law and opinion. They say also that honesty is for the
      most part less profitable than dishonesty; and they are quite ready to
      call wicked men happy, and to honour them both in public and private when
      they are rich or in any other way influential, while they despise and
      overlook <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage364B">B</a></span>those who may be weak and poor, even though acknowledging them to
      be better than the others. But most extraordinary of all is their mode of
      speaking about virtue and the gods: they say that the gods apportion
      calamity and misery to many good men, and good and happiness to the
      wicked. And mendicant prophets go to rich men’s doors and persuade them
      that they have a power committed to them by the gods of making an
      atonement for a man’s own or his ancestor’s <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage364C">C</a></span>sins by sacrifices or charms,
      with rejoicings and feasts; and they promise to harm an enemy, whether
      just or unjust, at a small cost; with magic arts and incantations binding
      heaven, as they say, to execute their will. And the poets are the
      authorities to whom they appeal, now smoothing the path of vice with the
      words of Hesiod;— <span class="pagenum"><a id="page44"></a>44</span>
</p>
<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="noind">
      ‘Vice may be had in abundance without trouble; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage364D">D</a></span>the way is smooth and her
      dwelling-place is near. But before virtue the gods have set toil<a href="#Footnotebook26" id="FnAnchorbook26" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">6</span></a>,’
    </p></div></div>
<p class="noind">
      and a tedious and uphill road: then citing Homer as a witness that the
      gods may be influenced by men; for he also says:—
    </p>
<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="noind">
      ‘The gods, too, may be turned from their purpose; and men pray to them and
      avert their wrath by sacrifices and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage364E">E</a></span>soothing entreaties, and by libations
      and the odour of fat, when they have sinned and transgressed<a href="#Footnotebook27" id="FnAnchorbook27" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">7</span></a>.’
    </p></div></div>
<p class="noind"><span class="sidenote">They are taught that sins may be easily expiated.</span>
      And they produce a host of books written by Musaeus and Orpheus, who were
      children of the Moon and the Muses—that is what they say—according
      to which they perform their ritual, and persuade not only individuals, but
      whole cities, that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by
      sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour, and are equally at the
      service of the living and the dead; the latter <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage365A">365</a></span>sort they call mysteries,
      and they redeem us from the pains of hell, but if we neglect them no one
      knows what awaits us.

<p><span class="sidenote">The effects of all this upon the youthful mind.</span>
      He proceeded: And now when the young hear all this said about virtue and
      vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their minds
      likely to be affected, my dear Socrates,—those of them, I mean, who
      are quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower, and
      from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of
      persons they should be and in what way they <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage365B">B</a></span>should walk if they would make
      the best of life? Probably the youth will say to himself in the words of
      Pindar—
    </p>
<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="noind">
      ‘Can I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower
      which may be a fortress to me all my days?’
    </p></div></div>
<p class="noind">
      For what men say is that, if I am really just and am not also thought just
      profit there is none, but the pain and loss on the other hand are
      unmistakeable. But if, though unjust, I acquire the reputation of justice,
      a heavenly life is promised to me. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage365C">C</a></span>Since then, as philosophers prove,
      appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness, to appearance I
      must devote myself. I will describe around me a picture and shadow of
      virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my <span class="pagenum"><a id="page45"></a>45</span> house; behind I will trail
      the subtle and crafty fox, as Archilochus, greatest of sages, recommends.
      But I hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often
      difficult; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage365D">D</a></span>to which I answer, Nothing great is easy. Nevertheless, the
      argument indicates this, if we would be happy, to be the path along which
      we should proceed. With a view to concealment we will establish secret
      brotherhoods and political clubs. And there are professors of rhetoric who
      teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies; and so, partly by
      persuasion and partly by force, I shall make unlawful gains and not be
      punished. Still I hear a voice saying that the gods cannot be deceived,
      neither can they be compelled. But what if there are no gods? or, suppose
      them to have no care of human things—why in either case <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage365E">E</a></span>should we
      mind about concealment? <span class="sidenote">The existence of
the gods is only known to us through the poets, who likewise assure us
that they may be bribed and that they are very ready to forgive.</span>And even if there are gods, and they do care about
      us, yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of the
      poets; and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced
      and turned by ‘sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings.’ Let
      us be consistent then, and believe both or neither. If the poets speak
      truly, why then we had better <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage366A">366</a></span>be unjust, and offer of the fruits of
      injustice; for if we are just, although we may escape the vengeance of
      heaven, we shall lose the gains of injustice; but, if we are unjust, we
      shall keep the gains, and by our sinning and praying, and praying and
      sinning, the gods will be propitiated, and we shall not be punished. ‘But
      there is a world below in which either we or our posterity will suffer for
      our unjust deeds.’ Yes, my friend, will be the reflection, but there are
      mysteries and atoning deities, and these have great power. That is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage366B">B</a></span>what
      mighty cities declare; and the children of the gods, who were their poets
      and prophets, bear a like testimony.
    </p>
<p>
      On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than
      the worst injustice? when, if we only unite the latter with a deceitful
      regard to appearances, we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men,
      in life and after death, as the most numerous and the highest authorities
      tell us. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage366C">C</a></span>Knowing all this, Socrates, how can a man who has any superiority
      of mind or person or rank or wealth, be willing to honour justice; or
      indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears <span class="pagenum"><a id="page46"></a>46</span> justice praised? <span class="sidenote">All this, even if not absolutely true, affords great excuse for doing wrong.</span>And even if
      there should be some one who is able to disprove the truth of my words,
      and who is satisfied that justice is best, still he is not angry with the
      unjust, but is very ready to forgive them, because he also <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage366D">D</a></span>knows that men
      are not just of their own free will; unless, peradventure, there be some
      one whom the divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of
      injustice, or who has attained knowledge of the truth—but no other
      man. He only blames injustice who, owing to cowardice or age or some
      weakness, has not the power of being unjust. And this is proved by the
      fact that when he obtains the power, he immediately becomes unjust as far
      as he can be.
    </p>
<p>
      The cause of all this, Socrates, was indicated by us at the beginning of
      the argument, when my brother and I told you how astonished we were to
      find that of all the professing <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage366E">E</a></span>panegyrists of justice—beginning
      with the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us, and
      ending with the men of our own time—no one has ever blamed injustice
      or praised justice except with a view to the glories, honours, and
      benefits which flow from them. No one has ever adequately described either
      in verse or prose the true essential nature of either of them abiding in
      the soul, and invisible to any human or divine eye; or shown that of all
      the things of a man’s soul which he has within him, justice is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage367A">367</a></span>the
      greatest good, and injustice the greatest evil. <span class="sidenote">Men should be taught that justice is in itself the greatest good and injustice the greatest evil.</span>Had this been the
      universal strain, had you sought to persuade us of this from our youth
      upwards, we should not have been on the watch to keep one another from
      doing wrong, but every one would have been his own watchman, because
      afraid, if he did wrong, of harbouring in himself the greatest of evils. I
      dare say that Thrasymachus and others would seriously hold the language
      which I have been merely repeating, and words even stronger than these
      about justice and injustice, grossly, as I conceive, perverting their true
      nature. But I speak in this <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage367B">B</a></span>vehement manner, as I must frankly confess to
      you, because I want to hear from you the opposite side; and I would ask
      you to show not only the superiority which justice has over injustice, but
      what effect they have on the possessor of them which makes the one to be a
      good and the other an evil to him. And please, as Glaucon requested of
      you, to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page47"></a>47</span> exclude reputations; for unless you take away from each of them
      his true reputation and add on the false, we shall say that you do not
      praise justice, but the appearance of it; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage367C">C</a></span>we shall think that you are only
      exhorting us to keep injustice dark, and that you really agree with
      Thrasymachus in thinking that justice is another’s good and the interest
      of the stronger, and that injustice is a man’s own profit and interest,
      though injurious to the weaker. Now as you have admitted that justice is
      one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed for their
      results, but in a far greater <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage367D">D</a></span>degree for their own sakes—like sight
      or hearing or knowledge or health, or any other real and natural and not
      merely conventional good—I would ask you in your praise of justice
      to regard one point only: I mean the essential good and evil which justice
      and injustice work in the possessors of them. Let others praise justice
      and censure injustice, magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and
      abusing the other; that is a manner of arguing which, coming from them, I
      am ready to tolerate, but from you who have spent your whole life in the
      consideration of this question, unless I hear the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage367E">E</a></span>contrary from your own
      lips, I expect something better. And therefore, I say, not only prove to
      us that justice is better than injustice, but show what they either of
      them do to the possessor of them, which makes the one to be a good and the
      other an evil, whether seen or unseen by gods and men.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">A<span class="smcap">DEIMANTUS</span>, S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>.</span>
      I had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus, but on hearing
      these words I was quite delighted, and said: <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage368A">368</a></span>Sons of an illustrious
      father, that was not a bad beginning of the Elegiac verses which the
      admirer of Glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished
      yourselves at the battle of Megara:—
    </p>
<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="noind">
            ‘Sons of Ariston,’ he sang, ‘divine offspring of an illustrious hero.’ </p></div></div>
<p class="noind"><span class="sidenote">Glaucon and Adeimantus able to argue so well, but unconvinced by their own arguments.</span>
      The epithet is very appropriate, for there is something truly divine in
      being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice, and
      remaining unconvinced by your own arguments. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage368B">B</a></span>And I do believe that you are
      not convinced—this I infer from your general character, for had I
      judged only from your speeches I should have mistrusted you. But now, the
      greater my confidence in you, the greater is my <span class="pagenum"><a id="page48"></a>48</span> difficulty in knowing what
      to say. For I am in a strait between two; on the one hand I feel that I am
      unequal to the task; and my inability is brought home to me by the fact
      that you were not satisfied with the answer which I made to Thrasymachus,
      proving, as I thought, the superiority which justice has over injustice.
      And yet I cannot refuse to help, while breath and speech remain to me; I
      am afraid that there would be an impiety in being present when justice <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage368C">C</a></span>is
      evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her defence. And therefore I
      had best give such help as I can.
    </p>
<p>
      Glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question
      drop, but to proceed in the investigation. They wanted to arrive at the
      truth, first, about the nature of justice and injustice, and secondly,
      about their relative advantages. I told them, what I really thought, that
      the enquiry would be of a serious nature, and would require very good
      eyes. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage368D">D</a></span><span class="sidenote">The large letters.</span>Seeing then, I said, that we are no great wits, I think that we had
      better adopt a method which I may illustrate thus; suppose that a
      short-sighted person had been asked by some one to read small letters from
      a distance; and it occurred to some one else that they might be found in
      another place which was larger and in which the letters were larger—if
      they were the same and he could read the larger letters first, and then
      proceed to the lesser—this would have been thought a rare piece of
      good fortune.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, said Adeimantus; but how does the illustration <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage368E">E</a></span>apply to our
      enquiry?
    </p>
<p>
      I will tell you, I replied; justice, which is the subject of our enquiry,
      is, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual, and
      sometimes as the virtue of a State.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And is not a State larger than an individual?
    </p>
<p>
      It is.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Justice to be seen in the State more easily than in the individual.</span>
      Then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and more
      easily discernible. I propose therefore that we enquire into the nature of
      justice and injustice, first as <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage369A">369</a></span>they appear in the State, and secondly in
      the individual, proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing
      them. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page49"></a>49</span>
</p>
<p>
      That, he said, is an excellent proposal.
    </p>
<p>
      And if we imagine the State in process of creation, we shall see the
      justice and injustice of the State in process of creation also.
    </p>
<p>
      I dare say.
    </p>
<p>
      When the State is completed there may be a hope that the object of our
      search will be more easily discovered.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage369B">B</a></span>Yes, far more easily.
    </p>
<p>
      But ought we to attempt to construct one? I said; for to do so, as I am
      inclined to think, will be a very serious task. Reflect therefore.
    </p>
<p>
      I have reflected, said Adeimantus, and am anxious that you should proceed.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The State arises out of the wants of men.</span>
      A State, I said, arises, as I conceive, out of the needs of mankind; no
      one is self-sufficing, but all of us have many wants. Can any other origin
      of a State be imagined?
    </p>
<p>
      There can be no other.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage369C">C</a></span>Then, as we have many wants, and many persons are needed to supply them,
      one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another; and when these
      partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the body of
      inhabitants is termed a State.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And they exchange with one another, and one gives, and another receives,
      under the idea that the exchange will be for their good.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, I said, let us begin and create in idea a State; and yet the true
      creator is necessity, who is the mother of our invention.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The four or five greater needs of life, and the four or five kinds of citizens who correspond to them.</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage369D">D</a></span>Now the first and greatest of necessities is food, which is the condition
      of life and existence.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      The second is a dwelling, and the third clothing and the like.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great demand:
      We may suppose that one man is a husbandman, another a builder, some one
      else a weaver—<span class="pagenum"><a id="page50"></a>50</span>shall we add to them a shoemaker, or perhaps some
      other purveyor to our bodily wants?
    </p>
<p>
      Quite right.
    </p>
<p>
      The barest notion of a State must include four or five men.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage369E">E</a></span>Clearly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The division of labour.</span>
      And how will they proceed? Will each bring the result of his labours into
      a common stock?—the individual husbandman, for example, producing
      for four, and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the
      provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself; or
      will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of
      producing for them, but provide for himself alone <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage370A">370</a></span>a fourth of the food in
      a fourth of the time, and in the remaining three fourths of his time be
      employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes, having no
      partnership with others, but supplying himself all his own wants?
    </p>
<p>
      Adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at
      producing everything.
    </p>
<p>
      Probably, I replied, that would be the better way; and when I hear you say
      this, I am myself reminded that we are <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage370B">B</a></span>not all alike; there are
      diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different
      occupations.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And will you have a work better done when the workman has many
      occupations, or when he has only one?
    </p>
<p>
      When he has only one.
    </p>
<p>
      Further, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the
      right time?
    </p>
<p>
      No doubt.
    </p>
<p>
      For business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is at
      leisure; but the doer must follow up what he <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage370C">C</a></span>is doing, and make the
      business his first object.
    </p>
<p>
      He must.
    </p>
<p>
      And if so, we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully and
      easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is
      natural to him and does it at the right time, and leaves other things.
    </p>
<p>
      Undoubtedly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The first citizens are:—1. a husbandman, 2. a builder. 3. a weaver, 4. a shoemaker. To these must be added:—5. a carpenter, 6. a smith, etc., 7. merchants, 8. retailers.</span>
      Then more than four citizens will be required; for the husbandman will not
      make his own plough or mattock, or <span class="pagenum"><a id="page51"></a>51</span> <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage370D">D</a></span>other implements of agriculture, if
      they are to be good for anything. Neither will the builder make his tools—and
      he too needs many; and in like manner the weaver and shoemaker.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      Then carpenters, and smiths, and many other artisans, will be sharers in
      our little State, which is already beginning to grow?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet even if we add neatherds, shepherds, and other herdsmen, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage370E">E</a></span>in order that
      our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with, and builders as well as
      husbandmen may have draught cattle, and curriers and weavers fleeces and
      hides,—still our State will not be very large.
    </p>
<p>
      That is true; yet neither will it be a very small State which contains all
      these.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, again, there is the situation of the city—to find a place
      where nothing need be imported is wellnigh impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      Then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required
      supply from another city?
    </p>
<p>
      There must.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage371A">371</a></span>But if the trader goes empty-handed, having nothing which they require who
      would supply his need, he will come back empty-handed.
    </p>
<p>
      That is certain.
    </p>
<p>
      And therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for
      themselves, but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate those
      from whom their wants are supplied.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      Then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required?
    </p>
<p>
      They will.
    </p>
<p>
      Not to mention the importers and exporters, who are called merchants?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Then we shall want merchants?
    </p>
<p>
      We shall.
    </p>
<p>
      And if merchandise is to be carried over the sea, skilful <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage371B">B</a></span>sailors will
      also be needed, and in considerable numbers?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, in considerable numbers.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page52"></a>52</span> productions? To
      secure such an exchange was, as you will remember, one of our principal
      objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a State.
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly they will buy and sell.
    </p>
<p>
      Then they will need a market-place, and a money-token for purposes of
      exchange.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The origin of retail trade.</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage371C">C</a></span>Suppose now that a husbandman, or an artisan, brings some production to
      market, and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with him,—is
      he to leave his calling and sit idle in the market-place?
    </p>
<p>
      Not at all; he will find people there who, seeing the want, undertake the
      office of salesmen. In well-ordered states they are commonly those who are
      the weakest in bodily strength, and therefore of little use for any other
      purpose; their duty is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage371D">D</a></span>to be in the market, and to give money in exchange
      for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money from those who
      desire to buy.
    </p>
<p>
      This want, then, creates a class of retail-traders in our State. Is not
      ‘retailer’ the term which is applied to those who sit in the market-place
      engaged in buying and selling, while those who wander from one city to
      another are called merchants?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage371E">E</a></span>And there is another class of servants, who are intellectually hardly on
      the level of companionship; still they have plenty of bodily strength for
      labour, which accordingly they sell, and are called, if I do not mistake,
      hirelings, hire being the name which is given to the price of their
      labour.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      Then hirelings will help to make up our population?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And now, Adeimantus, is our State matured and perfected?
    </p>
<p>
      I think so.
    </p>
<p>
      Where, then, is justice, and where is injustice, and in what part of the
      State did they spring up?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage372A">372</a></span>Probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another. I cannot
      imagine that they are more likely to be found any where else.
    </p>
<p>
      I dare say that you are right in your suggestion, I said; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page53"></a>53</span> we had better
      think the matter out, and not shrink from the enquiry.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">A picture of primitive life.</span>
      Let us then consider, first of all, what will be their way of life, now
      that we have thus established them. Will they not produce corn, and wine,
      and clothes, and shoes, and build houses for themselves? And when they are
      housed, they will work, in summer, commonly, stripped and barefoot, but <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage372B">B</a></span>in
      winter substantially clothed and shod. They will feed on barley-meal and
      flour of wheat, baking and kneading them, making noble cakes and loaves;
      these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or on clean leaves, themselves
      reclining the while upon beds strewn with yew or myrtle. And they and
      their children will feast, drinking of the wine which they have made,
      wearing garlands on their heads, and hymning the praises of the gods, in
      happy converse with one another. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage372C">C</a></span>And they will take care that their
      families do not exceed their means; having an eye to poverty or war.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, G<span class="smcap">LAUCON</span>.</span>
      But, said Glaucon, interposing, you have not given them a relish to their
      meal.
    </p>
<p>
      True, I replied, I had forgotten; of course they must have a relish—salt,
      and olives, and cheese, and they will boil roots and herbs such as country
      people prepare; for a dessert we shall give them figs, and peas, and
      beans; and they will roast myrtle-berries and acorns at the fire, drinking
      in moderation. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage372D">D</a></span>And with such a diet they may be expected to live in peace
      and health to a good old age, and bequeath a similar life to their
      children after them.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, Socrates, he said, and if you were providing for a city of pigs, how
      else would you feed the beasts?
    </p>
<p>
      But what would you have, Glaucon? I replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Why, he said, you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life.
      People who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas, and dine
      off tables, and they should <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage372E">E</a></span>have sauces and sweets in the modern style.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">A luxurious State must be called into existence,</span>
      Yes, I said, now I understand: the question which you would have me
      consider is, not only how a State, but how a luxurious State is created;
      and possibly there is no harm in this, for in such a State we shall be
      more likely to see how justice and injustice originate. In my opinion the
      true and healthy constitution of the State is the one which I have <span class="pagenum"><a id="page54"></a>54</span>
      described. But if you wish also to see a State at fever-heat, I have no
      objection. For I suspect that many will not be <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage373A">373</a></span>satisfied with the simpler
      way of life. They will be for adding sofas, and tables, and other
      furniture; also dainties, and perfumes, and incense, and courtesans, and
      cakes, all these not of one sort only, but in every variety; we must go
      beyond the necessaries of which I was at first speaking, such as houses,
      and clothes, and shoes: the arts of the painter and the embroiderer will
      have to be set in motion, and gold and ivory and all sorts of materials
      must be procured.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage373B">B</a></span>True, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">and in this many new callings will be required.</span>
      Then we must enlarge our borders; for the original healthy State is no
      longer sufficient. Now will the city have to fill and swell with a
      multitude of callings which are not required by any natural want; such as
      the whole tribe of hunters and actors, of whom one large class have to do
      with forms and colours; another will be the votaries of music—poets
      and their attendant train of rhapsodists, players, dancers, contractors;
      also makers of divers kinds of articles, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage373C">C</a></span>including women’s dresses. And we
      shall want more servants. Will not tutors be also in request, and nurses
      wet and dry, tirewomen and barbers, as well as confectioners and cooks;
      and swineherds, too, who were not needed and therefore had no place in the
      former edition of our State, but are needed now? They must not be
      forgotten: and there will be animals of many other kinds, if people eat
      them.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage373D">D</a></span>And living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians than
      before?
    </p>
<p>
      Much greater.
    </p>
<p>
      And the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants will
      be too small now, and not enough?
    </p>
<p>
      Quite true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The territory of our State must be enlarged; and hence will arise war between us and our neighbours.</span>
      Then a slice of our neighbours’ land will be wanted by us for pasture and
      tillage, and they will want a slice of ours, if, like ourselves, they
      exceed the limit of necessity, and give themselves up to the unlimited
      accumulation of wealth?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage373E">E</a></span>That, Socrates, will be inevitable.
    </p>
<p>
      And so we shall go to war, Glaucon. Shall we not?
    </p>
<p>
      Most certainly, he replied. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page55"></a>55</span>
</p>
<p>
      Then without determining as yet whether war does good or harm, thus much
      we may affirm, that now we have discovered war to be derived from causes
      which are also the causes of almost all the evils in States, private as
      well as public.
    </p>
<p>
      Undoubtedly.
    </p>
<p>
      And our State must once more enlarge; and this time the enlargement will
      be nothing short of a whole army, which <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage374A">374</a></span>will have to go out and fight with
      the invaders for all that we have, as well as for the things and persons
      whom we were describing above.
    </p>
<p>
      Why? he said; are they not capable of defending themselves?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">War is an art, and
 as no art can be pursued with success unless a man’s whole attention is
 devoted to it, a soldier cannot be allowed to exercise any calling but
his own.</span>
      No, I said; not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged
      by all of us when we were framing the State: the principle, as you will
      remember, was that one man cannot practise many arts with success.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage374B">B</a></span>But is not war an art?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking?
    </p>
<p>
      Quite true.
    </p>
<p>
      And the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be a husbandman, or a weaver,
      or a builder—in order that we might have our shoes well made; but to
      him and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by
      nature fitted, and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage374C">C</a></span>at that he was to continue working all his life long
      and at no other; he was not to let opportunities slip, and then he would
      become a good workman. Now nothing can be more important than that the
      work of a soldier should be well done. <span class="sidenote">The warrior’s art requires a long apprenticeship and many natural gifts.</span>But is war an art so easily
      acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman, or
      shoemaker, or other artisan; although no one in the world would be a good
      dice or draught player who merely took up the game as a recreation, and
      had not from his earliest years devoted himself to this and nothing else?
      No tools will make a man a skilled workman, or master of defence, nor be
      of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them, and has never
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage374D">D</a></span>bestowed any attention upon them. How then will he who takes up a shield
      or other implement of war become a good <span class="pagenum"><a id="page56"></a>56</span> fighter all in a day, whether with
      heavy-armed or any other kind of troops?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, the tools which would teach men their own use would be
      beyond price.
    </p>
<p>
      And the higher the duties of the guardian, I said, the more <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage374E">E</a></span>time, and
      skill, and art, and application will be needed by him?
    </p>
<p>
      No doubt, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The selection of guardians.</span>
      Then it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted
      for the task of guarding the city?
    </p>
<p>
      It will.
    </p>
<p>
      And the selection will be no easy matter, I said; but we must be brave and
      do our best.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage375A">375</a></span>We must.
    </p>
<p>
      Is not the noble youth very like a well-bred dog in respect of guarding
      and watching?
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      I mean that both of them ought to be quick to see, and swift to overtake
      the enemy when they see him; and strong too if, when they have caught him,
      they have to fight with him.
    </p>
<p>
      All these qualities, he replied, will certainly be required by them.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And is he likely to be brave who has no spirit, whether horse or dog or
      any other animal? Have you never observed <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage375B">B</a></span>how invincible and unconquerable
      is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature to be
      absolutely fearless and indomitable?
    </p>
<p>
      I have.
    </p>
<p>
      Then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are required
      in the guardian.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And also of the mental ones; his soul is to be full of spirit?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      But are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another, and
      with everybody else? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page57"></a>57</span>
</p>
<p>
      A difficulty by no means easy to overcome, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage375C">C</a></span>Whereas, I said, they ought to be dangerous to their enemies, and gentle
      to their friends; if not, they will destroy themselves without waiting for
      their enemies to destroy them.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      What is to be done then? I said; how shall we find a gentle nature which
      has also a great spirit, for the one is the contradiction of the other?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The guardian must unite the opposite qualities of gentleness and spirit.</span>
      He will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two
      qualities; and yet the combination of them <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage375D">D</a></span>appears to be impossible; and
      hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      I am afraid that what you say is true, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Here feeling perplexed I began to think over what had preceded.—My
      friend, I said, no wonder that we are in a perplexity; for we have lost
      sight of the image which we had before us.
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean? he said.
    </p>
<p>
      I mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite
      qualities.
    </p>
<p>
      And where do you find them?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Such a combination may be observed in the dog.</span>
      Many animals, I replied, furnish examples of them; our <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage375E">E</a></span>friend the dog is a
      very good one: you know that well-bred dogs are perfectly gentle to their
      familiars and acquaintances, and the reverse to strangers.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I know.
    </p>
<p>
      Then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our
      finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      Would not he who is fitted to be a guardian, besides the spirited nature,
      need to have the qualities of a philosopher?
    </p>
<p>
      I do not apprehend your meaning.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage376A">376</a></span>The trait of which I am speaking, I replied, may be also seen in the dog,
      and is remarkable in the animal.
    </p>
<p>
      What trait?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The dog distinguishes friend and enemy by the criterion of knowing and not knowing:</span>
      Why, a dog, whenever he sees a stranger, is angry; when an acquaintance,
      he welcomes him, although the one has <span class="pagenum"><a id="page58"></a>58</span> never done him any harm, nor the
      other any good. Did this never strike you as curious?
    </p>
<p>
      The matter never struck me before; but I quite recognise the truth of your
      remark.
    </p>
<p>
      And surely this instinct of the dog is very charming;—<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage376B">B</a></span>your dog is a
      true philosopher.
    </p>
<p>
      Why?
    </p>
<p>
      Why, because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only by
      the criterion of knowing and not knowing. And must not an animal be a
      lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test of
      knowledge and ignorance?
    </p>
<p>
      Most assuredly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">whereby he is shown to be a philosopher.</span>
      And is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is philosophy?
    </p>
<p>
      They are the same, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And may we not say confidently of man also, that he who <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage376C">C</a></span>is likely to be
      gentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a lover of
      wisdom and knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      That we may safely affirm.
    </p>
<p>
      Then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the State will
      require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and
      strength?
    </p>
<p>
      Undoubtedly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">How are our citizens to be reared and educated?</span>
      Then we have found the desired natures; and now that we have found them,
      how are they to be reared and educated? Is not this an enquiry which may
      be expected to throw light <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage376D">D</a></span>on the greater enquiry which is our final end—How
      do justice and injustice grow up in States? for we do not want either to
      omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an inconvenient
      length.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, A<span class="smcap">DEIMANTUS</span>.</span>
      Adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, I said, my dear friend, the task must not be given up, even if
      somewhat long.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      Come then, and let us pass a leisure hour in story-telling, and our story
      shall be the education of our heroes.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage376E">E</a></span>By all means.
    </p>
<p>
      And what shall be their education? Can we find a better <span class="pagenum"><a id="page59"></a>59</span> than the
      traditional sort?—and this has two divisions, gymnastic for the
      body, and music for the soul.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Education divided into gymnastic for the body and music for the soul. Music includes literature, which may be true or false.</span>
      Shall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic afterwards?
    </p>
<p>
      By all means.
    </p>
<p>
      And when you speak of music, do you include literature or not?
    </p>
<p>
      I do.
    </p>
<p>
      And literature may be either true or false?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage377A">377</a></span>And the young should be trained in both kinds, and we begin with the
      false?
    </p>
<p>
      I do not understand your meaning, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      You know, I said, that we begin by telling children stories which, though
      not wholly destitute of truth, are in the main fictitious; and these
      stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn gymnastics.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      That was my meaning when I said that we must teach music before
      gymnastics.
    </p>
<p>
      Quite right, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The beginning the most important part of education.</span>
      You know also that the beginning is the most important <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage377B">B</a></span>part of any work,
      especially in the case of a young and tender thing; for that is the time
      at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is more
      readily taken.
    </p>
<p>
      Quite true.
    </p>
<p>
      And shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which
      may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds ideas
      for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to
      have when they are grown up?
    </p>
<p>
      We cannot.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Works of fiction to be placed under a censorship.</span>
      Then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage377C">C</a></span>the writers of
      fiction, and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good,
      and reject the bad; and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their
      children the authorised ones only. Let them fashion the mind with such
      tales, even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands; but
      most of those which are now in use must be discarded. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page60"></a>60</span>
</p>
<p>
      Of what tales are you speaking? he said.
    </p>
<p>
      You may find a model of the lesser in the greater, I said; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage377D">D</a></span>for they are
      necessarily of the same type, and there is the same spirit in both of
      them.
    </p>
<p>
      Very likely, he replied; but I do not as yet know what you would term the
      greater.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Homer and Hesiod are tellers of bad lies, that is to say, they give false representations of the gods,</span>
      Those, I said, which are narrated by Homer and Hesiod, and the rest of the
      poets, who have ever been the great story-tellers of mankind.
    </p>
<p>
      But which stories do you mean, he said; and what fault do you find with
      them?
    </p>
<p>
      A fault which is most serious, I said; the fault of telling a lie, and,
      what is more, a bad lie.
    </p>
<p>
      But when is this fault committed?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage377E">E</a></span>Whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and
      heroes,—as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of
      a likeness to the original.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that sort of thing is certainly very blameable; but what are
      the stories which you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      First of all, I said, there was that greatest of all lies in high places,
      which the poet told about Uranus, and which was a bad lie too,—I
      mean what Hesiod says that Uranus did, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage378A">378</a></span>and how Cronus retaliated on him<a href="#Footnotebook28" id="FnAnchorbook28" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">8</span></a>.
      The doings of Cronus, and the sufferings which in turn his son inflicted
      upon him, even if they were true, ought certainly not to be lightly told
      to young and thoughtless persons; if possible, they had better be buried
      in silence. But if there is an absolute necessity for their mention, a
      chosen few might hear them in a mystery, and they should sacrifice not a
      common [Eleusinian] pig, but some huge and unprocurable victim; and then
      the number of the hearers will be very few indeed.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook28"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook28" class="pginternal">8</a></span> Hesiod, Theogony, 154, 459.</p></div>
<p>
      Why, yes, said he, those stories are extremely objectionable.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">which have a bad effect on the minds of youth.</span>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage378B">B</a></span>Yes, Adeimantus, they are stories not to be repeated in our State; the
      young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he is
      far from doing anything outrageous; and that even if he chastises his
      father when he does wrong, in whatever manner, he will only be following
      the example of the first and greatest among the gods. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page61"></a>61</span>
</p>
<p>
      I entirely agree with you, he said; in my opinion those stories are quite
      unfit to be repeated.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The stories about the quarrels of the gods and their evil behaviour to one another are untrue.</span>
      Neither, if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of
      quarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest, should any word
      be said to them of the wars in heaven, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage378C">C</a></span>and of the plots and fightings of
      the gods against one another, for they are not true. No, we shall never
      mention the battles of the giants, or let them be embroidered on garments;
      and we shall be silent about the innumerable other quarrels of gods and
      heroes with their friends and relatives. If they would only believe us we
      would tell them that quarrelling is unholy, and that never up to this time
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage378D">D</a></span>has there been any quarrel between citizens; this is what old men and old
      women should begin by telling children; and when they grow up, the poets
      also should be told to compose for them in a similar spirit<a href="#Footnotebook29" id="FnAnchorbook29" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">9</span></a>. But the
      narrative of Hephaestus binding Here his mother, or how on another
      occasion Zeus sent him flying for taking her part when she was being
      beaten, and all the battles of the gods in Homer—<span class="sidenote">And allegorical interpretations of them are not understood by the young.</span>these tales must
      not be admitted into our State, whether they are supposed to have an
      allegorical meaning or not. For a young person cannot judge what is
      allegorical and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage378E">E</a></span>what is literal; anything that he receives into his mind
      at that age is likely to become indelible and unalterable; and therefore
      it is most important that the tales which the young first hear should be
      models of virtuous thoughts.

<p>
      There you are right, he replied; but if any one asks where are such models
      to be found and of what tales are you speaking—how shall we answer
      him?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage379A">379</a></span>I said to him, You and I, Adeimantus, at this moment are not poets, but
      founders of a State: now the founders of a State ought to know the general
      forms in which poets should cast their tales, and the limits which must be
      observed by them, but to make the tales is not their business.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said; but what are these forms of theology which you mean?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">God is to be represented as he truly is.</span>
      Something of this kind, I replied:—God is always to be represented
      as he truly is, whatever be the sort of poetry, epic, lyric or tragic, in
      which the representation is given.
    </p>
<p>
      Right. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page62"></a>62</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage379B">B</a></span>And is he not truly good? and must he not be represented as such?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And no good thing is hurtful?
    </p>
<p>
      No, indeed.
    </p>
<p>
      And that which is not hurtful hurts not?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      And that which hurts not does no evil?
    </p>
<p>
      No.
    </p>
<p>
      And can that which does no evil be a cause of evil?
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      And the good is advantageous?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And therefore the cause of well-being?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      It follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things, but of
      the good only?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage379C">C</a></span>Assuredly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">God, if he be good, is the author of good only.</span>
      Then God, if he be good, is not the author of all things, as the many
      assert, but he is the cause of a few things only, and not of most things
      that occur to men. For few are the goods of human life, and many are the
      evils, and the good is to be attributed to God alone; of the evils the
      causes are to be sought elsewhere, and not in him.

<p>
      I agree with you, he replied, and am ready to give my assent to the law.
    </p>
<p>
      Let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods, to
      which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform,—that God
      is not the author of all things, but of good only.
    </p>
<p>
      That will do, he said.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage380D">D</a></span>And what do you think of a second principle? Shall I ask you whether God
      is a magician, and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape, and
      now in another—sometimes himself changing and passing into many
      forms, sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations;
      or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper image? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page64"></a>64</span>
</p>
<p>
      I cannot answer you, he said, without more thought.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Things must be changed either by another or by themselves.</span>
      Well, I said; but if we suppose a change in anything, that <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage380E">E</a></span>change must be
      effected either by the thing itself, or by some other thing?
    </p>
<p>
      Most certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered or
      discomposed; for example, when healthiest and strongest, the human frame
      is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks, and the plant which is
      in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat of the sun
      or any similar causes.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage381A">381</a></span>And will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged by
      any external influence?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And the same principle, as I should suppose, applies to all composite
      things—furniture, houses, garments: when good and well made, they
      are least altered by time and circumstances.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage381B">B</a></span>Then everything which is good, whether made by art or nature, or both, is
      least liable to suffer change from without?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      But surely God and the things of God are in every way perfect?
    </p>
<p>
      Of course they are.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">But God cannot be changed by other; and will not be changed by himself.</span>
      Then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many shapes?
    </p>
<p>
      He cannot.
    </p>
<p>
      But may he not change and transform himself?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly, he said, that must be the case if he is changed at all.
    </p>
<p>
      And will he then change himself for the better and fairer, or for the
      worse and more unsightly?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage381C">C</a></span>If he change at all he can only change for the worse, for we cannot
      suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, Adeimantus; but then, would any one, whether God or man, desire
      to make himself worse?
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      Then it is impossible that God should ever be willing to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page65"></a>65</span> change; being, as
      is supposed, the fairest and best that is conceivable, every God remains
      absolutely and for ever in his own form.
    </p>
<p>
      That necessarily follows, he said, in my judgment.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage381D">D</a></span> Then, I said, my dear friend, let none of the poets tell us that
    </p>

     </p></div></div>
<p class="noind">
      and let no one slander Proteus and Thetis, neither let any one, either in
      tragedy or in any other kind of poetry, introduce Here disguised in the

<p class="noind">
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage381E">E</a></span>—let us have no more lies of that sort. Neither must we have mothers
      under the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad version
      of these myths—telling how certain gods, as they say, ‘Go about by
      night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms;’ but let
      them take heed lest they make cowards of their children, and at the same
      time speak blasphemy against the gods.

<p>
      Heaven forbid, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      But although the gods are themselves unchangeable, still by witchcraft and
      deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms?
    </p>
<p>
      Perhaps, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Nor will he make any false representation of himself.</span>
      Well, but can you imagine that God will be willing to lie, whether in word
      or deed, or to put forth a phantom of himself?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage382A">382</a></span>I cannot say, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Do you not know, I said, that the true lie, if such an expression may be
      allowed, is hated of gods and men?
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean? he said.
    </p>
<p>
      I mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest and
      highest part of himself, or about the truest and highest matters; there,
      above all, he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page66"></a>66</span>
</p>
<p>
      Still, he said, I do not comprehend you.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage382B">B</a></span>The reason is, I replied, that you attribute some profound meaning to my
      words; but I am only saying that deception, or being deceived or
      uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of themselves,
      which is the soul, and in that part of them to have and to hold the lie,
      is what mankind least like;—that, I say, is what they utterly
      detest.
    </p>
<p>
      There is nothing more hateful to them.
    </p>
<p>
      And, as I was just now remarking, this ignorance in the soul of him who is
      deceived may be called the true lie; for the lie in words is only a kind
      of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul, not
      pure unadulterated <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage382C">C</a></span>falsehood. Am I not right?
    </p>
<p>
      Perfectly right.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The true lie is
equally hated both by gods and men; the remedial or preventive lie is
comparatively innocent, but God can have no need of it.</span>
      The true lie is hated not only by the gods, but also by men?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful; in
      dealing with enemies—that would be an instance; or again, when those
      whom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to do
      some harm, then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or preventive; also
      in the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage382D">D</a></span>tales of mythology, of which we were just now speaking—because
      we do not know the truth about ancient times, we make falsehood as much
      like truth as we can, and so turn it to account.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      But can any of these reasons apply to God? Can we suppose that he is
      ignorant of antiquity, and therefore has recourse to invention?
    </p>
<p>
      That would be ridiculous, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the lying poet has no place in our idea of God?
    </p>
<p>
      I should say not.
    </p>
<p>
      Or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies?
    </p>
<p>
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage382E">E</a></span>That is inconceivable.
    </p>
<p>
      But he may have friends who are senseless or mad?
    </p>
<p>
      But no mad or senseless person can be a friend of God.
    </p>
<p>
      Then no motive can be imagined why God should lie?
    </p>
<p>
      None whatever. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page67"></a>67</span>
</p>
<p>
      Then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Then is God perfectly simple and true both in word and deed<a href="#Footnotebook214" id="FnAnchorbook214" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">14</span></a>; he changes
      not; he deceives not, either by sign or word, by dream or waking vision.

    </p>
<p>
      You agree with me then, I said, that this is the second type or form in
      which we should write and speak about divine things. The gods are not
      magicians who transform themselves, neither do they deceive mankind in any
      way.

      thought that the word of Phoebus, being divine and full of prophecy, would

<p>
      Undoubtedly.
    </p>
<p>
      Also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names which
      describe the world below—Cocytus and Styx, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage387C">C</a></span>ghosts under the earth,
      and sapless shades, and any similar words of which the very mention causes
      a shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them. I do not
      say that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind; but there
      is a danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered too excitable
      and effeminate by them.
    </p>
<p>
      There is a real danger, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then we must have no more of them.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      Another and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page70"></a>70</span>
</p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage387D">D</a></span>
      And shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous
      men?
    </p>
<p>
      They will go with the rest.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The effeminate and pitiful strains of famous men, and yet more of the gods, must also be banished.</span>
      But shall we be right in getting rid of them? Reflect: our principle is
      that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good man
      who is his comrade.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes; that is our principle.
    </p>
<p>
      And therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he had
      suffered anything terrible?
    </p>
<p>
      He will not.
    </p>
<p>
      Such an one, as we further maintain, is sufficient for himself <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage387E">E</a></span>and his own
      happiness, and therefore is least in need of other men.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And for this reason the loss of a son or brother, or the deprivation of
      fortune, is to him of all men least terrible.
    </p>
<p>
      Assuredly.
    </p>
<p>
      And therefore he will be least likely to lament, and will bear with the
      greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he will feel such a misfortune far less than another.
    </p>
<p>
      Then we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous men,
      and making them over to women (and not <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage388A">388</a></span>even to women who are good for
      anything), or to men of a baser sort, that those who are being educated by
      us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the like.
    </p>
<p>
      That will be very right.

<p>
      Yes, I replied; but that surely is what ought not to be, as the argument

      So I believe.

      On my views, if you like to father them on me; that we <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage389B">B</a></span>must not admit them

<p><span class="sidenote"> Our youth must be truthful,</span>
      Again, truth should be highly valued; if, as we were saying, a lie is

      have no business with them.

<p>
      Clearly not, he said.

      Then if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying, the rulers of

      good. But nobody else should <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage389C">C</a></span>meddle with anything of the kind; and
      although the rulers have this privilege, for a private man to lie to them
      in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the patient or the
      pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his own bodily illnesses
      to the physician or to the trainer, or for a sailor not to tell the
      captain what is happening about the ship and the rest of the crew, and how

    </p>
<p>
      Most true, he said.

      Loving Homer as I do<a href="#Footnotebook329" id="FnAnchorbook329" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">29</span></a>, I hardly like to say that in attributing these
      feelings to Achilles, or in believing that they are truly attributed to
      him, he is guilty of downright impiety. As little can I believe the
      narrative of his insolence to Apollo, where he says,

      Peleus who was the gentlest of men and third in descent from Zeus, was so
      disordered in his wits as to be at one time the slave of two seemingly
      inconsistent passions, meanness, not untainted by avarice, combined with
      overweening contempt of gods and men.

      You are quite right, he replied.

<p><span class="sidenote"> The tale of Theseus and Peirithous.</span>
      And let us equally refuse to believe, or allow to be repeated, the tale of
      Theseus son of Poseidon, or of Peirithous <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage391D">D</a></span>son of Zeus, going forth as they
      did to perpetrate a horrid rape; or of any other hero or son of a god
      daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely ascribe to
      them in our day: and let us further compel the poets to declare either
      that these acts were not done by them, or that they were not the sons of
      gods;—both in the same breath they shall not be permitted to affirm.

<p>
      By all means, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      But now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are not to
      be spoken of, let us see whether any have been omitted by us. The manner
      in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should be
      treated has been already laid down.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Misstatements of the poets about men.</span>
      And what shall we say about men? That is clearly the remaining portion of
      our subject.
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly so.
    </p>
<p>
      But we are not in a condition to answer this question at present, my
      friend.
    </p>
<p>
      Why not?
    </p>
<p>
      Because, if I am not mistaken, we shall have to say that <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage392B">B</a></span>about men poets
      and story-tellers are guilty of making the gravest misstatements when they
      tell us that wicked men are often happy, and the good miserable; and that
      injustice is profitable when undetected, but that justice is a man’s own
      loss and another’s gain—these things we shall forbid them to utter,
      and command them to sing and say the opposite.
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure we shall, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      But if you admit that I am right in this, then I shall maintain that you
      have implied the principle for which we have been all along contending.
    </p>
<p>
      I grant the truth of your inference.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage392C">C</a></span>
      That such things are or are not to be said about men is a question which
      we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is, and how
      naturally advantageous to the possessor, whether he seem to be just or
      not.
    </p>
<p>
      Most true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Enough of the subjects of poetry: let us now speak of the style; and when
      this has been considered, both matter and manner will have been completely
      treated.
    </p>
<p>
      I do not understand what you mean, said Adeimantus.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage392D">D</a></span>
      Then I must make you understand; and perhaps I may be more intelligible if
      I put the matter in this way. You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology
      and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he replied. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page77"></a>77</span>
</p>
<p>
      And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of
      the two?
    </p>
<p>
      That again, he said, I do not quite understand.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Analysis of the dramatic element in Epic poetry.</span>
      I fear that I must be a ridiculous teacher when I have so much difficulty
      in making myself apprehended. Like a bad speaker, therefore, I will not
      take the whole of the subject, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage392E">E</a></span>but will break a piece off in illustration
      of my meaning. You know the first lines of the Iliad, in which the poet
      says that <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage393A">393</a></span>Chryses prayed Agamemnon to release his daughter, and that
      Agamemnon flew into a passion with him; whereupon Chryses, failing of his
      object, invoked the anger of the God against the Achaeans. Now as far as
      these lines,
    </p>
<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="noind">
      ‘And he prayed all the Greeks, but especially the two sons of Atreus, the
      chiefs of the people,’
    </p></div></div>
<p class="noind">
      the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that
      he is any one else. But in what follows he takes the person of Chryses,
      and then he does all that he can <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage393B">B</a></span>to make us believe that the speaker is
      not Homer, but the aged priest himself. And in this double form he has
      cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at Troy and in
      Ithaca and throughout the Odyssey.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites
      from time to time and in the intermediate passages?
    </p>
<p>
      Quite true.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage393C">C</a></span> <span class="sidenote"> Epic poetry has an element of imitation in the speeches; the rest is simple narrative.</span>
      But when the poet speaks in the person of another, may we not say that he
      assimilates his style to that of the person who, as he informs you, is
      going to speak?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or
      gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes?
    </p>
<p>
      Of course.
    </p>
<p>
      Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way
      of imitation?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Illustrations from the beginning of the Iliad.</span>
      Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage393D">D</a></span>himself, then again
      the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration.
      However, in order that I may <span class="pagenum"><a id="page78"></a>78</span> make my meaning quite clear, and that you may
      no more say, ‘I don’t understand,’ I will show how the change might be
      effected. If Homer had said, ‘The priest came, having his daughter’s
      ransom in his hands, supplicating the Achaeans, and above all the kings;’
      and then if, instead of speaking in the person of Chryses, he had
      continued in his own person, the words would have been, not imitation, but
      simple narration. The passage would have run as follows (I am no poet, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage393E">E</a></span>and
      therefore I drop the metre), ‘The priest came and prayed the gods on
      behalf of the Greeks that they might capture Troy and return safely home,
      but begged that they would give him back his daughter, and take the ransom
      which he brought, and respect the God. Thus he spoke, and the other Greeks
      revered the priest and assented. But Agamemnon was wroth, and bade him
      depart and not come again, lest the staff and chaplets of the God should
      be of no avail to him—the daughter of Chryses should not be
      released, he said—she should grow old with him in Argos. And then he
      told him to go away and not to provoke him, if he intended to get home
      unscathed. And the old man went away in fear and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage394A">394</a></span>silence, and, when he had
      left the camp, he called upon Apollo by his many names, reminding him of
      everything which he had done pleasing to him, whether in building his
      temples, or in offering sacrifice, and praying that his good deeds might
      be returned to him, and that the Achaeans might expiate his tears by the
      arrows of the god,’—and so on. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage394B">B</a></span>In this way the whole becomes simple
      narrative.
    </p>
<p>
      I understand, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Tragedy and Comedy
 are wholly imitative; dithyrambic and some other kinds of poetry are
devoid of imitation. Epic poetry is a combination of the two.</span>
      Or you may suppose the opposite case—that the intermediate passages
      are omitted, and the dialogue only left.
    </p>
<p>
      That also, he said, I understand; you mean, for example, as in tragedy.
    </p>
<p>
      You have conceived my meaning perfectly; and if I mistake not, what you
      failed to apprehend before is now made <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage394C">C</a></span>clear to you, that poetry and
      mythology are, in some cases, wholly imitative—instances of this are
      supplied by tragedy and comedy; there is likewise the opposite style, in
      which the poet is the only speaker—of this the dithyramb affords the
      best example; and the combination of both is found in epic, and in several
      other styles of poetry. Do I take you with me? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page79"></a>79</span>
</p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; I see now what you meant.
    </p>
<p>
      I will ask you to remember also what I began by saying, that we had done
      with the subject and might proceed to the style.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I remember.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage394D">D</a></span>
      In saying this, I intended to imply that we must come to an understanding
      about the mimetic art,—whether the poets, in narrating their
      stories, are to be allowed by us to imitate, and if so, whether in whole
      or in part, and if the latter, in what parts; or should all imitation be
      prohibited?
    </p>
<p>
      You mean, I suspect, to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted
      into our State?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> A hint about Homer (cp. <i>infra</i>, <a href="#stpage595A" class="pginternal">bk. x</a>.)</span>
      Yes, I said; but there may be more than this in question: I really do not
      know as yet, but whither the argument may blow, thither we go.
    </p>
<p>
      And go we will, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage394E">E</a></span> <span class="sidenote"> Our guardians ought not to be imitators, for one man can only do one thing well;</span>
      Then, Adeimantus, let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be
      imitators; or rather, has not this question been decided by the rule
      already laid down that one man can only do one thing well, and not many;
      and that if he attempt many, he will altogether fail of gaining much
      reputation in any?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And this is equally true of imitation; no one man can imitate many things
      as well as he would imitate a single one?
    </p>
<p>
      He cannot.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage395A">395</a></span>
      Then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life,
      and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts as
      well; for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied, the same
      persons cannot succeed in both, as, for example, the writers of tragedy
      and comedy—did you not just now call them imitations?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I did; and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot
      succeed in both.
    </p>
<p>
      Any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage395B">B</a></span>
      Neither are comic and tragic actors the same; yet all these things are but
      imitations.
    </p>
<p>
      They are so.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> he cannot even imitate many things.</span>
      And human nature, Adeimantus, appears to have been <span class="pagenum"><a id="page80"></a>80</span> coined into yet smaller
      pieces, and to be as incapable of imitating many things well, as of
      performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies.
    </p>
<p>
      Quite true, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      If then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our
      guardians, setting aside every other business, are to <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage395C">C</a></span>dedicate themselves
      wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the State, making this their
      craft, and engaging in no work which does not bear on this end, they ought
      not to practise or imitate anything else; if they imitate at all, they
      should imitate from youth upward only those characters which are suitable
      to their profession—the courageous, temperate, holy, free, and the
      like; but they should not depict or be skilful at imitating any kind of
      illiberality or baseness, lest from imitation they should come to be what
      they imitate. Did <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage395D">D</a></span>you never observe how imitations, beginning in early
      youth and continuing far into life, at length grow into habits and become
      a second nature, affecting body, voice, and mind?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, certainly, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Imitations which are of the degrading sort.</span>
      Then, I said, we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of
      whom we say that they ought to be good men, to imitate a woman, whether
      young or old, quarrelling with her husband, or striving and vaunting
      against the gods in <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage395E">E</a></span>conceit of her happiness, or when she is in
      affliction, or sorrow, or weeping; and certainly not one who is in
      sickness, love, or labour.
    </p>
<p>
      Very right, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Neither must they represent slaves, male or female, performing the offices
      of slaves?
    </p>
<p>
      They must not.
    </p>
<p>
      And surely not bad men, whether cowards or any others, who do the reverse
      of what we have just been prescribing, who scold or mock or revile one
      another in drink or out of drink, or who in any other manner sin against
      themselves and their neighbours in word or deed, as the manner of such is.
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage396A">396</a></span>Neither should they be trained to imitate the action or speech of men or
      women who are mad or bad; for madness, like vice, is to be known but not
      to be practised or imitated.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he replied. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page81"></a>81</span>
</p>
<p>
      Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage396B">B</a></span>oarsmen, or
      boatswains, or the like?
    </p>
<p>
      How can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their minds to
      the callings of any of these?
    </p>
<p>
      Nor may they imitate the neighing of horses, the bellowing of bulls, the
      murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean, thunder, and all that sort of
      thing?
    </p>
<p>
      Nay, he said, if madness be forbidden, neither may they copy the behaviour
      of madmen.
    </p>
<p>
      You mean, I said, if I understand you aright, that there is one sort of
      narrative style which may be employed by a truly <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage396C">C</a></span>good man when he has
      anything to say, and that another sort will be used by a man of an
      opposite character and education.
    </p>
<p>
      And which are these two sorts? he asked.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Imitations which may be encouraged.</span>
      Suppose, I answered, that a just and good man in the course of a narration
      comes on some saying or action of another good man,—I should imagine
      that he will like to personate him, and will not be ashamed of this sort
      of imitation: he will be most ready to play the part of the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage396D">D</a></span>good man when
      he is acting firmly and wisely; in a less degree when he is overtaken by
      illness or love or drink, or has met with any other disaster. But when he
      comes to a character which is unworthy of him, he will not make a study of
      that; he will disdain such a person, and will assume his likeness, if at
      all, for a moment only when he is performing some good action; at other
      times he will be ashamed to play a part which he has never practised, nor
      will he like to fashion and frame himself after the baser models; he feels
      the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage396E">E</a></span>employment of such an art, unless in jest, to be beneath him, and his
      mind revolts at it.
    </p>
<p>
      So I should expect, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated out of
      Homer, that is to say, his style will be both imitative and narrative; but
      there will be very little of the former, and a great deal of the latter.
      Do you agree?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said; that is the model which such a speaker <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage397A">397</a></span>must
      necessarily take.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Imitations which are to be prohibited.</span>
      But there is another sort of character who will narrate anything, and, the
      worse he is, the more unscrupulous he will be; nothing will be too bad for
      him: and he will be ready to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page82"></a>82</span> imitate anything, not as a joke, but in right
      good earnest, and before a large company. As I was just now saying, he
      will attempt to represent the roll of thunder, the noise of wind and hail,
      or the creaking of wheels, and pulleys, and the various sounds of flutes,
      pipes, trumpets, and all sorts of instruments: he will bark like a dog,
      bleat like <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage397B">B</a></span>a sheep, or crow like a cock; his entire art will consist in
      imitation of voice and gesture, and there will be very little narration.
    </p>
<p>
      That, he said, will be his mode of speaking.
    </p>
<p>
      These, then, are the two kinds of style?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Two kinds of style—the one simple, the other multiplex. There is also a third which is a combination of the two.</span>
      And you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and has
      but slight changes; and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen for
      their simplicity, the result is that the speaker, if he speaks correctly,
      is always pretty much the same in style, and he will keep within the
      limits of a single harmony (for the changes are not great), and in <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage397C">C</a></span>like
      manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm?
    </p>
<p>
      That is quite true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of
      rhythms, if the music and the style are to correspond, because the style
      has all sorts of changes.
    </p>
<p>
      That is also perfectly true, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend all
      poetry, and every form of expression in words? No one can say anything
      except in one or other of them or in both together.
    </p>
<p>
      They include all, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage397D">D</a></span> <span class="sidenote"> The simple style
alone is to be admitted in the State; the attractions of the mixed style
 are acknowledged, but it appears to be excluded.</span>
      And shall we receive into our State all the three styles, or one only of
      the two unmixed styles? or would you include the mixed?
    </p>
<p>
      I should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, Adeimantus, but the mixed style is also very charming: and
      indeed the pantomimic, which is the opposite of the one chosen by you, is
      the most popular style with children and their attendants, and with the
      world in general.
    </p>
<p>
      I do not deny it.
    </p>
<p>
      But I suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage397E">E</a></span>to our
      State, in which human nature is not twofold or manifold, for one man plays
      one part only? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page83"></a>83</span>
</p>
<p>
      Yes; quite unsuitable.
    </p>
<p>
      And this is the reason why in our State, and in our State only, we shall
      find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also, and a husbandman
      to be a husbandman and not a dicast also, and a soldier a soldier and not
      a trader also, and the same throughout?
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage398A">398</a></span> <span class="sidenote"> The pantomimic artist is to receive great honours, but he is to be sent out of the country.</span>
      And therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen, who are so
      clever that they can imitate anything, comes to us, and makes a proposal
      to exhibit himself and his poetry, we will fall down and worship him as a
      sweet and holy and wonderful being; but we must also inform him that in
      our State such as he are not permitted to exist; the law will not allow
      them. And so when we have anointed him with myrrh, and set a garland of
      wool upon his head, we shall send him away to another city. For we mean to
      employ for <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage398B">B</a></span>our souls’ health the rougher and severer poet or story-teller,
      who will imitate the style of the virtuous only, and will follow those
      models which we prescribed at first when we began the education of our
      soldiers.
    </p>
<p>
      We certainly will, he said, if we have the power.
    </p>
<p>
      Then now, my friend, I said, that part of music or literary education
      which relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished; for
      the matter and manner have both been discussed.
    </p>
<p>
      I think so too, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage398C">C</a></span>
      Next in order will follow melody and song.
    </p>
<p>
      That is obvious.
    </p>
<p>
      Every one can see already what we ought to say about them, if we are to be
      consistent with ourselves.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, G<span class="smcap">LAUCON</span>.</span>
      I fear, said Glaucon, laughing, that the word ‘every one’ hardly includes
      me, for I cannot at the moment say what they should be; though I may
      guess.
    </p>
<p>
      At any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage398D">D</a></span>parts—the
      words, the melody, and the rhythm; that degree of knowledge I may
      presuppose?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; so much as that you may.
    </p>
<p>
      And as for the words, there will surely be no difference between words
      which are and which are not set to music; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page84"></a>84</span> both will conform to the same
      laws, and these have been already determined by us?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Melody and rhythm.</span>
      And the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      We were saying, when we spoke of the subject-matter, that we had no need
      of lamentation and strains of sorrow?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage398E">E</a></span>
      And which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow? You are musical, and can
      tell me.
    </p>
<p>
      The harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor Lydian, and the
      full-toned or bass Lydian, and such like.
    </p>
<p>
      These then, I said, must be banished; even to women who have a character
      to maintain they are of no use, and much less to men.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      In the next place, drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly
      unbecoming the character of our guardians.
    </p>
<p>
      Utterly unbecoming.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The relaxed melodies or harmonies are the Ionian and the Lydian. These are to be banished.</span>
      And which are the soft or drinking harmonies?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage399A">399</a></span>
      The Ionian, he replied, and the Lydian; they are termed ‘relaxed.’
    </p>
<p>
      Well, and are these of any military use?
    </p>
<p>
      Quite the reverse, he replied; and if so the Dorian and the Phrygian are
      the only ones which you have left.
    </p>
<p>
      I answered: Of the harmonies I know nothing, but I want to have one
      warlike, to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the hour
      of danger and stern resolve, or when his cause is failing, and he is going
      to wounds or <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage399B">B</a></span>death or is overtaken by some other evil, and at every such
      crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a determination to
      endure; and another to be used by him in times of peace and freedom of
      action, when there is no pressure of necessity, and he is seeking to
      persuade God by prayer, or man by instruction and admonition, or on the
      other hand, when he is expressing his willingness to yield to persuasion
      or entreaty or admonition, and which represents him when by prudent
      conduct he has attained his end, not carried away by his success, but
      acting moderately and wisely <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage399C">C</a></span>under the circumstances, and acquiescing in
      the event. These <span class="pagenum"><a id="page85"></a>85</span> two harmonies I ask you to leave; the strain of necessity
      and the strain of freedom, the strain of the unfortunate and the strain of
      the fortunate, the strain of courage, and the strain of temperance; these,
      I say, leave.
    </p>
<p>
      And these, he replied, are the Dorian and Phrygian harmonies of which I
      was just now speaking.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The Dorian and Phrygian are to be retained.</span>
      Then, I said, if these and these only are to be used in our songs and
      melodies, we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic scale?
    </p>
<p>
      I suppose not.
    </p>
<p>
      Then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners and
      complex scales, or the makers of any other <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage399D">D</a></span>many-stringed
      curiously-harmonised instruments?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Musical instruments—which are to be rejected and which allowed?</span>
      But what do you say to flute-makers and flute-players? Would you admit
      them into our State when you reflect that in this composite use of harmony
      the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put together; even
      the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly not.
    </p>
<p>
      There remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city, and the
      shepherds may have a pipe in the country.
    </p>
<p>
      That is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage399E">E</a></span>
      The preferring of Apollo and his instruments to Marsyas and his
      instruments is not at all strange, I said.
    </p>
<p>
      Not at all, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And so, by the dog of Egypt, we have been unconsciously purging the State,
      which not long ago we termed luxurious.
    </p>
<p>
      And we have done wisely, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Then let us now finish the purgation, I said. Next in order to harmonies,
      rhythms will naturally follow, and they should be subject to the same
      rules, for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre, or metres of
      every kind, but rather to discover what rhythms are the expressions of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage400A">400</a></span>a
      courageous and harmonious life; and when we have found them, we shall
      adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like spirit, not the words
      to the foot and melody. To say what these rhythms are will be your duty—you
      must teach me them, as you have already taught me the harmonies. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page86"></a>86</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Three kinds of rhythm as there are four notes of the tetrachord.</span>
      But, indeed, he replied, I cannot tell you. I only know that there are
      some three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are framed,
      just as in sounds there are four notes<a href="#Footnotebook336" id="FnAnchorbook336" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">36</span></a> out of which all the harmonies are composed; that is an
      observation which I have made. But of what sort of lives they are
      severally the imitations I am unable to say.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook336"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook336" class="pginternal">36</a></span> i.e. the four notes of the tetrachord.</p></div>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage400B">B</a></span>
      Then, I said, we must take Damon into our counsels; and he will tell us
      what rhythms are expressive of meanness, or insolence, or fury, or other
      unworthiness, and what are to be reserved for the expression of opposite
      feelings. And I think that I have an indistinct recollection of his
      mentioning a complex Cretic rhythm; also a dactylic or heroic, and he
      arranged them in some manner which I do not quite understand, making the
      rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot, long and short
      alternating; and, unless I am mistaken, he spoke of an iambic as well as
      of a trochaic rhythm, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage400C">C</a></span>and assigned to them short and long quantities.<a href="#Footnotebook337" id="FnAnchorbook337" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">37</span></a> Also
      in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the movement of the foot
      quite as much as the rhythm; or perhaps a combination of the two; for I am
      not certain what he meant. These matters, however, as I was saying, had
      better be referred to Damon himself, for the analysis of the subject would
      be difficult, you know?
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook337"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook337" class="pginternal">37</a></span> Socrates expresses himself
carelessly in accordance with his assumed ignorance of the details of
the subject. In the first part of the sentence he appears to be speaking
of paeonic rhythms which are in the ratio of <span class="smcap"><sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span>; in the second part, of
dactylic and anapaestic rhythms, which are in the ratio of <span class="smcap"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>1</sub></span>; in the

<span class="smcap"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></span> or <span class="smcap"><sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>1</sub></span>.</p></div>
<p>
      Rather so, I should say.
    </p>
<p>
      But there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace is
      an effect of good or bad rhythm.
    </p>
<p>
      None at all.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage400D">D</a></span><span class="sidenote"> Rhythm and harmony follow style, and style is the expression of the soul.</span>
      And also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and bad
      style; and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style; for our
      principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the words, and not
      the words by them.
    </p>
<p>
      Just so, he said, they should follow the words.
    </p>
<p>
      And will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper
      of the soul? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page87"></a>87</span>
</p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And everything else on the style?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Simplicity the great first principle;</span>
      Then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage400E">E</a></span>rhythm depend on
      simplicity,—I mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly
      ordered mind and character, not that other simplicity which is only an
      euphemism for folly?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And if our youth are to do their work in life, must they not make these
      graces and harmonies their perpetual aim?
    </p>
<p>
      They must.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage401A">401</a></span> <span class="sidenote"> and a principle which is widely spread in nature and art.</span>
      And surely the art of the painter and every other creative and
      constructive art are full of them,—weaving, embroidery,
      architecture, and every kind of manufacture; also nature, animal and
      vegetable,—in all of them there is grace or the absence of grace.
      And ugliness and discord and inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill
      words and ill nature, as grace and harmony are the twin sisters of
      goodness and virtue and bear their likeness.
    </p>
<p>
      That is quite true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage401B">B</a></span> <span class="sidenote"> Our citizens must grow up to manhood amidst impressions of grace and beauty only; all ugliness and vice must be excluded.</span>
      But shall our superintendence go no further, and are the poets only to be
      required by us to express the image of the good in their works, on pain,
      if they do anything else, of expulsion from our State? Or is the same
      control to be extended to other artists, and are they also to be
      prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance and
      meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other creative
      arts; and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be prevented
      from practising his art in our State, lest the taste of our citizens be
      corrupted by him? We would not have our guardians grow up amid images of
      moral deformity, as in some noxious pasture, and there <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage401C">C</a></span>browse and feed
      upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day, little by little, until
      they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in their own soul. Let
      our artists rather be those who are gifted to discern the true nature of
      the beautiful and graceful; then will our youth dwell in a land of health,
      amid fair sights and sounds, and receive the good in everything; and
      beauty, the effluence of fair works, shall <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage401D">D</a></span>flow into the eye and ear, like
      a health-giving breeze from a purer region, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page88"></a>88</span> insensibly draw the soul
      from earliest years into likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason.
    </p>
<p>
      There can be no nobler training than that, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The power of imparting grace is possessed by harmony.</span>
      And therefore, I said, Glaucon, musical training is a more potent
      instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way into
      the inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten, imparting
      grace, and making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful, or of
      him who <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage401E">E</a></span>is ill-educated ungraceful; and also because he who has received
      this true education of the inner being will most shrewdly perceive
      omissions or faults in art and nature, and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage402A">402</a></span>with a true taste, while he
      praises and rejoices over and receives into his soul the good, and becomes
      noble and good, he will justly blame and hate the bad, now in the days of
      his youth, even before he is able to know the reason why; and when reason
      comes he will recognise and salute the friend with whom his education has
      made him long familiar.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, I quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should be
      trained in music and on the grounds which you mention.
    </p>
<p>
      Just as in learning to read, I said, we were satisfied when we knew the
      letters of the alphabet, which are very few, in all their recurring sizes
      and combinations; not slighting them <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage402B">B</a></span>as unimportant whether they occupy a
      space large or small, but everywhere eager to make them out; and not
      thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we recognise them
      wherever they are found<a href="#Footnotebook338" id="FnAnchorbook338" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">38</span></a>:

<p>
      True—
    </p>
<p>
      Or, as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water, or in a
      mirror, only when we know the letters themselves; the same art and study
      giving us the knowledge of both:
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly—
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The true musician must know the essential forms of virtue and vice.</span>
      Even so, as I maintain, neither we nor our guardians, whom <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage402C">C</a></span>we have to
      educate, can ever become musical until we and they know the essential
      forms of temperance, courage, liberality, magnificence, and their kindred,
      as well as the contrary forms, in all their combinations, and can
      recognise them and their images wherever they are found, not slighting <span class="pagenum"><a id="page89"></a>89</span>
      them either in small things or great, but believing them all to be within
      the sphere of one art and study.
    </p>
<p>
      Most assuredly.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage402D">D</a></span> <span class="sidenote"> The harmony of soul and body the fairest of sights.</span>
      And when a beautiful soul harmonizes with a beautiful form, and the two
      are cast in one mould, that will be the fairest of sights to him who has
      an eye to see it?
    </p>
<p>
      The fairest indeed.
    </p>
<p>
      And the fairest is also the loveliest?
    </p>
<p>
      That may be assumed.
    </p>
<p>
      And the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the
      loveliest; but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The true lover will not mind defects of the person.</span>
      That is true, he replied, if the deficiency be in his soul; but if there
      be any merely bodily defect in another he will <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage402E">E</a></span>be patient of it, and will
      love all the same.
    </p>
<p>
      I perceive, I said, that you have or have had experiences of this sort,
      and I agree. But let me ask you another question: Has excess of pleasure
      any affinity to temperance?
    </p>
<p>
      How can that be? he replied; pleasure deprives a man of the use of his
      faculties quite as much as pain.
    </p>
<p>
      Or any affinity to virtue in general?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage403A">403</a></span>
      None whatever.
    </p>
<p>
      Any affinity to wantonness and intemperance?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, the greatest.
    </p>
<p>
      And is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love?
    </p>
<p>
      No, nor a madder.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> True love is temperate and harmonious.</span>
      Whereas true love is a love of beauty and order—temperate and
      harmonious?
    </p>
<p>
      Quite true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage403B">B</a></span> <span class="sidenote"> True love is free from sensuality and coarseness.</span>
      Then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the
      lover and his beloved; neither of them can have any part in it if their
      love is of the right sort?
    </p>
<p>
      No, indeed, Socrates, it must never come near them.
    </p>
<p>
      Then I suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make a law
      to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his love
      than a father would use to his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page90"></a>90</span> son, and then only for a noble purpose, and
      he must first have the other’s consent; and this rule is to limit him in
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage403C">C</a></span>all his intercourse, and he is never to be seen going further, or, if he
      exceeds, he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and bad taste.
    </p>
<p>
      I quite agree, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus much of music, which makes a fair ending; for what should be the end
      of music if not the love of beauty?
    </p>
<p>
      I agree, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Gymnastic.</span>
      After music comes gymnastic, in which our youth are next to be trained.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years; the training in it
      should be careful and should continue through life. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage403D">D</a></span>Now my belief is,—and
      this is a matter upon which I should like to have your opinion in
      confirmation of my own, but my own belief is,—not that the good body
      by any bodily excellence improves the soul, but, on the contrary, that the
      good soul, by her own excellence, improves the body as far as this may be
      possible. What do you say?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I agree.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The body to be entrusted to the mind.</span>
      Then, to the mind when adequately trained, we shall be right in handing
      over the more particular care of the body; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage403E">E</a></span>and in order to avoid prolixity
      we will now only give the general outlines of the subject.
    </p>
<p>
      Very good.
    </p>
<p>
      That they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by us;
      for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and not know
      where in the world he is.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; that a guardian should require another guardian to take care
      of him is ridiculous indeed.
    </p>
<p>
      But next, what shall we say of their food; for the men are in training for
      the great contest of all—are they not?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage404A">404</a></span>
      And will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them?
    </p>
<p>
      Why not?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The usual training of athletes too gross and sleepy.</span>
      I am afraid, I said, that a habit of body such as they have is but a
      sleepy sort of thing, and rather perilous to health. Do you not observe
      that these athletes sleep away their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page91"></a>91</span> lives, and are liable to most
      dangerous illnesses if they depart, in ever so slight a degree, from their
      customary regimen?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I do.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, I said, a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior
      athletes, who are to be like wakeful dogs, and to see and hear with the
      utmost keenness; amid the many changes of water and also of food, of
      summer heat and winter <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage404B">B</a></span>cold, which they will have to endure when on a
      campaign, they must not be liable to break down in health.
    </p>
<p>
      That is my view.
    </p>
<p>
      The really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music which
      we were just now describing.
    </p>
<p>
      How so?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Military gymnastic.</span>
      Why, I conceive that there is a gymnastic which, like our music, is simple
      and good; and especially the military gymnastic.
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      My meaning may be learned from Homer; he, you know, feeds his heroes at
      their feasts, when they are campaigning, on soldiers’ fare; they have no
      fish, although they are on <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage404C">C</a></span>the shores of the Hellespont, and they are not
      allowed boiled meats but only roast, which is the food most convenient for
      soldiers, requiring only that they should light a fire, and not involving
      the trouble of carrying about pots and pans.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And I can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere
      mentioned in Homer. In proscribing them, however, he is not singular; all
      professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in good
      condition should take nothing of the kind.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; and knowing this, they are quite right in not taking them.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage404D">D</a></span> <span class="sidenote"> Syracusan dinners and Corinthian courtezans are prohibited.</span>
      Then you would not approve of Syracusan dinners, and the refinements of
      Sicilian cookery?
    </p>
<p>
      I think not.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor, if a man is to be in condition, would you allow him to have a
      Corinthian girl as his fair friend?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page92"></a>92</span>
</p>
<p>
      Neither would you approve of the delicacies, as they are thought, of
      Athenian confectionary?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The luxurious style of living may be justly compared to the panharmonic strain of music.</span>
      All such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage404E">E</a></span>to melody and
      song composed in the panharmonic style, and in all the rhythms.
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p>
      There complexity engendered licence, and here disease; whereas simplicity
      in music was the parent of temperance in the soul; and simplicity in
      gymnastic of health in the body.
    </p>
<p>
      Most true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage405A">405</a></span>
      But when intemperance and diseases multiply in a State, halls of justice
      and medicine are always being opened; and the arts of the doctor and the
      lawyer give themselves airs, finding how keen is the interest which not
      only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about them.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Every man should be his own doctor and lawyer.</span>
      And yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state of
      education than this, that not only artisans and the meaner sort of people
      need the skill of first-rate physicians and judges, but also those who
      would profess to <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage405B">B</a></span>have had a liberal education? Is it not disgraceful, and
      a great sign of want of good-breeding, that a man should have to go abroad
      for his law and physic because he has none of his own at home, and must
      therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men whom he makes
      lords and judges over him?
    </p>
<p>
      Of all things, he said, the most disgraceful.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Bad as it is to go to law, it is still worse to be a lover of litigation.</span>
      Would you say ‘most,’ I replied, when you consider that there is a further
      stage of the evil in which a man is not only a life-long litigant, passing
      all his days in the courts, either as plaintiff or defendant, but is
      actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his litigiousness; he
      imagines that he is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage405C">C</a></span>a master in dishonesty; able to take every crooked
      turn, and wriggle into and out of every hole, bending like a withy and
      getting out of the way of justice: and all for what?—in order to
      gain small points not worth mentioning, he not knowing that so to order
      his life as to be able to do without a napping judge is a far higher and
      nobler sort of thing. Is not that still more disgraceful? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page93"></a>93</span>
</p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that is still more disgraceful.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Bad also to require the help of medicine.</span>
      Well, I said, and to require the help of medicine, not when a wound has to
      be cured, or on occasion of an epidemic, but <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage405D">D</a></span>just because, by indolence
      and a habit of life such as we have been describing, men fill themselves
      with waters and winds, as if their bodies were a marsh, compelling the
      ingenious sons of Asclepius to find more names for diseases, such as
      flatulence and catarrh; is not this, too, a disgrace?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names to
      diseases.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> In the time of Asclepius and of Homer the practice of medicine was very simple.</span>
      Yes, I said, and I do not believe that there were any such <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage405E">E</a></span>diseases in the
      days of Asclepius; and this I infer from the circumstance that the hero
      Eurypylus, after he has been wounded in Homer, drinks a posset of Pramnian
      wine well <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage406A">406</a></span>besprinkled with barley-meal and grated cheese, which are
      certainly inflammatory, and yet the sons of Asclepius who were at the
      Trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink, or rebuke
      Patroclus, who is treating his case.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, he said, that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a
      person in his condition.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The nursing of disease began with Herodicus.</span>
      Not so extraordinary, I replied, if you bear in mind that in former days,
      as is commonly said, before the time of Herodicus, the guild of Asclepius
      did not practise our present system of medicine, which may be said to
      educate diseases. But Herodicus, being a trainer, and himself of a sickly
      constitution, by a combination of training and doctoring found <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage406B">B</a></span>out a way
      of torturing first and chiefly himself, and secondly the rest of the
      world.
    </p>
<p>
      How was that? he said.
    </p>
<p>
      By the invention of lingering death; for he had a mortal disease which he
      perpetually tended, and as recovery was out of the question, he passed his
      entire life as a valetudinarian; he could do nothing but attend upon
      himself, and he was in constant torment whenever he departed in anything
      from his usual regimen, and so dying hard, by the help of science he
      struggled on to old age.
    </p>
<p>
      A rare reward of his skill!
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage406C">C</a></span>
      Yes, I said; a reward which a man might fairly expect who never understood
      that, if Asclepius did not instruct his descendants in valetudinarian
      arts, the omission arose, not <span class="pagenum"><a id="page94"></a>94</span> from ignorance or inexperience of such a
      branch of medicine, but because he knew that in all well-ordered states
      every individual has an occupation to which he must attend, and has
      therefore no leisure to spend in continually being ill. This we remark in
      the case of the artisan, but, ludicrously enough, do not apply the same
      rule to people of the richer sort.
    </p>
<p>
      How do you mean? he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage406D">D</a></span> <span class="sidenote"> The working-man has no time for tedious remedies.</span>
      I mean this: When a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough and
      ready cure; an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife,—these
      are his remedies. And if some one prescribes for him a course of
      dietetics, and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head, and all
      that sort of thing, he replies at once that he has no time to be ill, and
      that he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing his disease to
      the neglect of his customary employment; and therefore <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage406E">E</a></span>bidding good-bye to
      this sort of physician, he resumes his ordinary habits, and either gets
      well and lives and does his business, or, if his constitution fails, he
      dies and has no more trouble.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art of
      medicine thus far only.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage407A">407</a></span>
      Has he not, I said, an occupation; and what profit would there be in his
      life if he were deprived of his occupation?
    </p>
<p>
      Quite true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      But with the rich man this is otherwise; of him we do not say that he has
      any specially appointed work which he must perform, if he would live.
    </p>
<p>
      He is generally supposed to have nothing to do.
    </p>
<p>
      Then you never heard of the saying of Phocylides, that as soon as a man
      has a livelihood he should practise virtue?
    </p>
<p>
      Nay, he said, I think that he had better begin somewhat sooner.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The slow cure equally an impediment to the mechanical arts, to the practice of virtue</span>
      Let us not have a dispute with him about this, I said; but rather ask
      ourselves: Is the practice of virtue obligatory on <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage407B">B</a></span>the rich man, or can he
      live without it? And if obligatory on him, then let us raise a further
      question, whether this dieting of disorders, which is an impediment to the
      application of the mind in carpentering and the mechanical arts, does not
      equally stand in the way of the sentiment of Phocylides? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page95"></a>95</span>
</p>
<p>
      Of that, he replied, there can be no doubt; such excessive care of the
      body, when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic, is most inimical to the
      practice of virtue.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> and to any kind of study or thought.</span>
<a href="#Footnotebook339" id="FnAnchorbook339" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">39</span></a>Yes, indeed, I replied, and equally incompatible with the management of a
      house, an army, or an office of state; and, what is most important of all,
      irreconcileable with any kind <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage407C">C</a></span>of study or thought or self-reflection—there
      is a constant suspicion that headache and giddiness are to be ascribed to
      philosophy, and hence all practising or making trial of virtue in the
      higher sense is absolutely stopped; for a man is always fancying that he
      is being made ill, and is in constant anxiety about the state of his body.

<p>
      Yes, likely enough.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Asclepius would not cure diseased constitutions because they were of no use to the State.</span>
      And therefore our politic Asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited the
      power of his art only to persons who, being generally of healthy
      constitution and habits of life, had <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage407D">D</a></span>a definite ailment; such as these he
      cured by purges and operations, and bade them live as usual, herein
      consulting the interests of the State; but bodies which disease had
      penetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure by
      gradual processes of evacuation and infusion: he did not want to lengthen
      out good-for-nothing lives, or to have weak fathers begetting weaker sons;—if
      a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had no business to cure
      him; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage407E">E</a></span>for such a cure would have been of no use either to himself, or to
      the State.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, he said, you regard Asclepius as a statesman.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The case of Menelaus, who was attended by the sons of Asclepius.</span>
      Clearly; and his character is further illustrated by his sons. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage408A">408</a></span>Note that
      they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of which I
      am speaking at the siege of Troy: You will remember how, when Pandarus
      wounded Menelaus, they
    </p>
<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="noind">
      ‘Sucked the blood out of the wound, and sprinkled soothing remedies<a href="#Footnotebook340" id="FnAnchorbook340" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">40</span></a>,’
    </p></div></div>
<p class="noind">
      but they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or drink
      in the case of Menelaus, any more than in the case of Eurypylus; the
      remedies, as they conceived, were enough to heal any man who before he was
      wounded was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page96"></a>96</span> <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage408B">B</a></span>healthy and regular in his habits; and even though he did
      happen to drink a posset of Pramnian wine, he might get well all the same.
      But they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and intemperate subjects,
      whose lives were of no use either to themselves or others; the art of
      medicine was not designed for their good, and though they were as rich as
      Midas, the sons of Asclepius would have declined to attend them.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook340"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook340" class="pginternal">40</a></span> Iliad iv. 218.</p></div>
<p>
      They were very acute persons, those sons of Asclepius.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The offence of Asclepius.</span>
      Naturally so, I replied. Nevertheless, the tragedians and Pindar
      disobeying our behests, although they acknowledge that Asclepius was the
      son of Apollo, say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man who was
      at the point of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage408C">C</a></span>death, and for this reason he was struck by lightning. But
      we, in accordance with the principle already affirmed by us, will not
      believe them when they tell us both;—if he was the son of a god, we
      maintain that he was not avaricious; or, if he was avaricious, he was not
      the son of a god.
    </p>
<p>
      All that, Socrates, is excellent; but I should like to put a question to
      you: Ought there not to be good physicians in a State, and are not the
      best those who have treated the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage408D">D</a></span>greatest number of constitutions good and
      bad? and are not the best judges in like manner those who are acquainted
      with all sorts of moral natures?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, I too would have good judges and good physicians. But do you
      know whom I think good?
    </p>
<p>
      Will you tell me?
    </p>
<p>
      I will, if I can. Let me however note that in the same question you join
      two things which are not the same.
    </p>
<p>
      How so? he asked.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The physician should have experience of illness in his own person;</span>
      Why, I said, you join physicians and judges. Now the most skilful
      physicians are those who, from their youth upwards, have combined with the
      knowledge of their art <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage408E">E</a></span>the greatest experience of disease; they had better
      not be robust in health, and should have had all manner of diseases in
      their own persons. For the body, as I conceive, is not the instrument with
      which they cure the body; in that case we could not allow them ever to be
      or to have been sickly; but they cure the body with the mind, and the mind
      which has become and is sick can cure nothing. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page97"></a>97</span>
</p>
<p>
      That is very true, he said.

<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage409A">409</a></span> <span class="sidenote"> on the other hand, the judge should not learn to know evil by the practice of it, but by long observation of evil in others.</span>
      But with the judge it is otherwise; since he governs mind by mind; he
      ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds, and to have
      associated with them from youth upwards, and to have gone through the
      whole calendar of crime, only in order that he may quickly infer the
      crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own
      self-consciousness; the honourable mind which is to form a healthy
      judgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits
      when young. And this is the reason why in youth good men often appear to
      be simple, and are <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage409B">B</a></span>easily practised upon by the dishonest, because they
      have no examples of what evil is in their own souls.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, they are far too apt to be deceived.
    </p>
<p>
      Therefore, I said, the judge should not be young; he should have learned
      to know evil, not from his own soul, but from late and long observation of
      the nature of evil in others: <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage409C">C</a></span>knowledge should be his guide, not personal
      experience.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that is the ideal of a judge.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Such a knowledge of human nature far better and truer than that of the adept in crime.</span>
      Yes, I replied, and he will be a good man (which is my answer to your
      question); for he is good who has a good soul. But the cunning and
      suspicious nature of which we spoke,—he who has committed many
      crimes, and fancies himself to be a master in wickedness, when he is
      amongst his fellows, is wonderful in the precautions which he takes,
      because he judges of them by himself: but when he gets into the company of
      men of virtue, who have the experience of age, he appears to be a fool
      again, owing to his unseasonable suspicions; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage409D">D</a></span>he cannot recognise an honest
      man, because he has no pattern of honesty in himself; at the same time, as
      the bad are more numerous than the good, and he meets with them oftener,
      he thinks himself, and is by others thought to be, rather wise than
      foolish.
    </p>
<p>
      Most true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man, but the
      other; for vice cannot know virtue too, but a virtuous nature, educated by
      time, will acquire a knowledge <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage409E">E</a></span>both of virtue and vice: the virtuous, and
      not the vicious, man has wisdom—in my opinion.
    </p>
<p>
      And in mine also. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page98"></a>98</span>
</p>
<p>
      This is the sort of medicine, and this is the sort of law, which you will
      sanction in your state. They will minister to <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage410A">410</a></span>better natures, giving
      health both of soul and of body; but those who are diseased in their
      bodies they will leave to die, and the corrupt and incurable souls they
      will put an end to themselves.
    </p>
<p>
      That is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the State.
    </p>
<p>
      And thus our youth, having been educated only in that simple music which,
      as we said, inspires temperance, will be reluctant to go to law.
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage410B">B</a></span>
      And the musician, who, keeping to the same track, is content to practise
      the simple gymnastic, will have nothing to do with medicine unless in some
      extreme case.
    </p>
<p>
      That I quite believe.
    </p>
<p>
      The very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to stimulate
      the spirited element of his nature, and not to increase his strength; he
      will not, like common athletes, use exercise and regimen to develope his
      muscles.
    </p>
<p>
      Very right, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage410C">C</a></span> <span class="sidenote"> Music and gymnastic are equally designed for the improvement of the mind.</span>
      Neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed, as is
      often supposed, the one for the training of the soul, the other for the
      training of the body.
    </p>
<p>
      What then is the real object of them?
    </p>
<p>
      I believe, I said, that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the
      improvement of the soul.
    </p>
<p>
      How can that be? he asked.
    </p>
<p>
      Did you never observe, I said, the effect on the mind itself of exclusive
      devotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to
      music?
    </p>
<p>
      In what way shown? he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage410D">D</a></span> <span class="sidenote"> The mere athlete must be softened, and the philosophic nature prevented from becoming too soft</span>
      The one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity, the other of softness
      and effeminacy, I replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, I am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much of a
      savage, and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond what is
      good for him.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet surely, I said, this ferocity only comes from spirit, which, if
      rightly educated, would give courage, but, if too much intensified, is
      liable to become hard and brutal. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page99"></a>99</span>
</p>
<p>
      That I quite think.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage410E">E</a></span>
      On the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness. And
      this also, when too much indulged, will turn to softness, but, if educated
      rightly, will be gentle and moderate.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?
    </p>
<p>
      Assuredly.
    </p>
<p>
      And both should be in harmony?
    </p>
<p>
      Beyond question.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage411A">411</a></span>
      And the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Music, if carried too far, renders the weaker nature effeminate, the stronger irritable.</span>
      And, when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul
      through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs of
      which we were just now speaking, and his whole life is passed in warbling
      and the delights of song; in the first stage of the process the passion or
      spirit which is in him is tempered like iron, and made <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage411B">B</a></span>useful, instead of
      brittle and useless. But, if he carries on the softening and soothing
      process, in the next stage he begins to melt and waste, until he has
      wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of his soul; and he becomes
      a feeble warrior.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      If the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily
      accomplished, but if he have a good deal, then the power of music
      weakening the spirit renders him excitable;—on the least provocation
      he flames up at once, and is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage411C">C</a></span>speedily extinguished; instead of having
      spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable.
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> And in like manner the well-fed athlete, if he have no education, degenerates into a wild beast.</span>
      And so in gymnastics, if a man takes violent exercise and is a great
      feeder, and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy, at
      first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit, and
      he becomes twice the man that he was. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page100"></a>100</span>
</p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And what happens? if he do nothing else, and holds no <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage411D">D</a></span>converse with the
      Muses, does not even that intelligence which there may be in him, having
      no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture, grow
      feeble and dull and blind, his mind never waking up or receiving
      nourishment, and his senses not being purged of their mists?
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy, uncivilized, never using
      the weapon of persuasion,—he is like a wild <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage411E">E</a></span>beast, all violence and
      fierceness, and knows no other way of dealing; and he lives in all
      ignorance and evil conditions, and has no sense of propriety and grace.
    </p>
<p>
      That is quite true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And as there are two principles of human nature, one the spirited and the
      other the philosophical, some God, as I should say, has given mankind two
      arts answering to them (and only indirectly to the soul and body), in
      order that these <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage412A">412</a></span>two principles (like the strings of an instrument) may be
      relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly harmonized.
    </p>
<p>
      That appears to be the intention.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Music to be mingled with gymnastic, and both attempered to the individual soul.</span>
      And he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions, and
      best attempers them to the soul, may be rightly called the true musician
      and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the strings.
    </p>
<p>
      You are quite right, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      And such a presiding genius will be always required in our State if the
      government is to last.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage412B">B</a></span>
      Yes, he will be absolutely necessary.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Enough of principles of education: who are to be our rulers?</span>
      Such, then, are our principles of nurture and education: Where would be
      the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens, or
      about their hunting and coursing, their gymnastic and equestrian contests?
      For these all follow the general principle, and having found that, we
      shall have no difficulty in discovering them.
    </p>
<p>
      I dare say that there will be no difficulty.
    </p>
<p>
      Very good, I said; then what is the next question? Must we not ask who are
      to be rulers and who subjects?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage412C">C</a></span>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The elder must rule and the younger serve.</span>
      There can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page101"></a>101</span>
</p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      And that the best of these must rule.
    </p>
<p>
      That is also clear.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to husbandry?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And as we are to have the best of guardians for our city, must they not be
      those who have most the character of guardians?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And to this end they ought to be wise and efficient, and to have a special
      care of the State?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage412D">D</a></span>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Those are to be appointed rulers who have been tested in all the stages of their life;</span>
      And a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves?
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure.
    </p>
<p>
      And he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the
      same interests with himself, and that of which the good or evil fortune is
      supposed by him at any time most to affect his own?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Then there must be a selection. Let us note among the guardians those who
      in their whole life show the greatest <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage412E">E</a></span>eagerness to do what is for the good
      of their country, and the greatest repugnance to do what is against her
      interests.
    </p>
<p>
      Those are the right men.
    </p>
<p>
      And they will have to be watched at every age, in order that we may see
      whether they preserve their resolution, and never, under the influence
      either of force or enchantment, forget or cast off their sense of duty to
      the State.
    </p>
<p>
      How cast off? he said.
    </p>
<p>
      I will explain to you, I replied. A resolution may go out of a man’s mind
      either with his will or against his will; with <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage413A">413</a></span>his will when he gets rid
      of a falsehood and learns better, against his will whenever he is deprived
      of a truth.
    </p>
<p>
      I understand, he said, the willing loss of a resolution; the meaning of
      the unwilling I have yet to learn.
    </p>
<p>
      Why, I said, do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good, and
      willingly of evil? Is not to have lost the truth an evil, and to possess
      the truth a good? and you <span class="pagenum"><a id="page102"></a>102</span> would agree that to conceive things as they are
      is to possess the truth?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he replied; I agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived of
      truth against their will.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage413B">B</a></span>
      And is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft, or force,
      or enchantment?
    </p>
<p>
      Still, he replied, I do not understand you.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> and who are unchanged by the influence either of pleasure, or of fear,</span>
      I fear that I must have been talking darkly, like the tragedians. I only
      mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others forget;
      argument steals away the hearts of one class, and time of the other; and
      this I call theft. Now you understand me?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Those again who are forced, are those whom the violence of some pain or
      grief compels to change their opinion.
    </p>
<p>
      I understand, he said, and you are quite right.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage413C">C</a></span> <span class="sidenote"> or of enchantments.</span>
      And you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change
      their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure, or the sterner
      influence of fear?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; everything that deceives may be said to enchant.
    </p>
<p>
      Therefore, as I was just now saying, we must enquire who are the best
      guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest of the
      State is to be the rule of their lives. We must watch them from their
      youth upwards, and make them perform actions in which they are most likely
      to forget or to be deceived, and he who remembers and is not deceived <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage413D">D</a></span>is
      to be selected, and he who fails in the trial is to be rejected. That will
      be the way?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for
      them, in which they will be made to give further proof of the same
      qualities.
    </p>
<p>
      Very right, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And then, I said, we must try them with enchantments—that is the
      third sort of test—and see what will be their behaviour: like those
      who take colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature,
      so must we take our youth amid terrors of some kind, and again pass them
      into pleasures, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage413E">E</a></span>and prove them more thoroughly than gold is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page103"></a>103</span> proved in the
      furnace, that we may discover whether they are armed against all
      enchantments, and of a noble bearing always, good guardians of themselves
      and of the music which they have learned, and retaining under all
      circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature, such as will be most
      serviceable to the individual and to the State. <span class="sidenote"> If they stand the test they are to be honoured in life and after death.</span>And he who at every age,
      as boy and youth and in mature life, has come out of the trial victorious
      and pure, shall be appointed <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage414A">414</a></span>a ruler and guardian of the State; he shall
      be honoured in life and death, and shall receive sepulture and other
      memorials of honour, the greatest that we have to give. But him who fails,
      we must reject. I am inclined to think that this is the sort of way in
      which our rulers and guardians should be chosen and appointed. I speak
      generally, and not with any pretension to exactness.
    </p>
<p>
      And, speaking generally, I agree with you, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage414B">B</a></span> <span class="sidenote"> The title of guardians to be reserved for the elders, the young men to be called auxiliaries.</span>
      And perhaps the word ‘guardian’ in the fullest sense ought to be applied
      to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies and
      maintain peace among our citizens at home, that the one may not have the
      will, or the others the power, to harm us. The young men whom we before
      called guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries and
      supporters of the principles of the rulers.
    </p>
<p>
      I agree with you, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      How then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we lately
      spoke—just one royal lie which may <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage414C">C</a></span>deceive the rulers, if that be
      possible, and at any rate the rest of the city?
    </p>
<p>
      What sort of lie? he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The Phoenician tale.</span>
      Nothing new, I replied; only an old Phoenician<a href="#Footnotebook341" id="FnAnchorbook341" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">41</span></a> tale of what has

      How your words seem to hesitate on your lips!
    </p>
<p>
      You will not wonder, I replied, at my hesitation when you have heard.

      Speak, he said, and fear not. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page104"></a>104</span>
</p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage414D">D</a></span> <span class="sidenote"> The citizens to be told that they are really autochthonous, sent up out of the earth,</span>
      Well then, I will speak, although I really know not how to look you in the
      face, or in what words to utter the audacious fiction, which I propose to
      communicate gradually, first to the rulers, then to the soldiers, and
      lastly to the people. They are to be told that their youth was a dream,
      and the education and training which they received from us, an appearance
      only; in reality during all that time they were being formed and fed in
      the womb of the earth, where they <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage414E">E</a></span>themselves and their arms and
      appurtenances were manufactured; when they were completed, the earth,
      their mother, sent them up; and so, their country being their mother and
      also their nurse, they are bound to advise for her good, and to defend her
      against attacks, and her citizens they are to regard as children of the
      earth and their own brothers.
    </p>
<p>
      You had good reason, he said, to be ashamed of the lie which you were
      going to tell.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage415A">415</a></span> <span class="sidenote"> and composed of metals of various quality.</span>
      True, I replied, but there is more coming; I have only told you half.
      Citizens, we shall say to them in our tale, you are brothers, yet God has
      framed you differently. Some of you have the power of command, and in the
      composition of these he has mingled gold, wherefore also they have the
      greatest honour; others he has made of silver, to be auxiliaries; others
      again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has composed of brass and
      iron; and the species will generally be preserved in the children. But as
      all are of the same original stock, a golden parent will sometimes have a
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage415B">B</a></span>silver son, or a silver parent a golden son. And God proclaims as a first
      principle to the rulers, and above all else, that there is nothing which
      they should so anxiously guard, or of which they are to be such good
      guardians, as of the purity of the race. <span class="sidenote"> The noble quality to rise in the State, the ignoble to descend.</span>They should observe what elements
      mingle in their offspring; for if the son of a golden or silver parent has
      an admixture of brass and iron, then nature orders <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage415C">C</a></span>a transposition of
      ranks, and the eye of the ruler must not be pitiful towards the child
      because he has to descend in the scale and become a husbandman or artisan,
      just as there may be sons of artisans who having an admixture of gold or
      silver in them are raised to honour, and become guardians or auxiliaries.
      For an oracle says that when a man of brass or iron guards the State, it
      will be destroyed. <span class="sidenote"> Is such a fiction credible?—Yes, in a future generation; not in the present.</span>Such is the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page105"></a>105</span> tale; is there any possibility of making
      our citizens believe in it?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage415D">D</a></span>
      Not in the present generation, he replied; there is no way of
      accomplishing this; but their sons may be made to believe in the tale, and
      their sons’ sons, and posterity after them.
    </p>
<p>
      I see the difficulty, I replied; yet the fostering of such a belief will
      make them care more for the city and for one another. Enough, however, of
      the fiction, which may now fly abroad upon the wings of rumour, while we
      arm our earth-born heroes, and lead them forth under the command of their
      rulers. <span class="sidenote"> The selection of a site for the warriors’ camp.</span>Let them look round and select a spot whence they can best
      suppress insurrection, if any prove refractory <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage415E">E</a></span>within, and also defend
      themselves against enemies, who like wolves may come down on the fold from
      without; there let them encamp, and when they have encamped, let them
      sacrifice to the proper Gods and prepare their dwellings.
    </p>
<p>
      Just so, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold of
      winter and the heat of summer.
    </p>
<p>
      I suppose that you mean houses, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said; but they must be the houses of soldiers, and not of
      shop-keepers.
    </p>
<p>
      What is the difference? he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage416A">416</a></span> <span class="sidenote"> The warriors must be humanized by education.</span>
      That I will endeavour to explain, I replied. To keep watch-dogs, who, from
      want of discipline or hunger, or some evil habit or other, would turn upon
      the sheep and worry them, and behave not like dogs but wolves, would be a
      foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd?
    </p>
<p>
      Truly monstrous, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage416B">B</a></span>
      And therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries, being
      stronger than our citizens, may not grow to be too much for them and
      become savage tyrants instead of friends and allies?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, great care should be taken.
    </p>
<p>
      And would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard?
    </p>
<p>
      But they are well-educated already, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      I cannot be so confident, my dear Glaucon, I said; I am much more certain
      that they ought to be, and that true <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage416C">C</a></span>education, whatever that may be, will
      have the greatest <span class="pagenum"><a id="page106"></a>106</span> tendency to civilize and humanize them in their
      relations to one another, and to those who are under their protection.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And not only their education, but their habitations, and all that belongs
      to them, should be such as will neither impair their virtue as guardians,
      nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage416D">D</a></span>Any man of sense must
      acknowledge that.
    </p>
<p>
      He must.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Their way of life will be that of a camp</span>
      Then now let us consider what will be their way of life, if they are to
      realize our idea of them. In the first place, none of them should have any
      property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary; neither should
      they have a private house or store closed against any one who has a mind
      to enter; their provisions should be only such as are required by trained
      warriors, who are men of temperance and courage; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage416E">E</a></span>they should agree to
      receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay, enough to meet the expenses
      of the year and no more; and they will go to mess and live together like
      soldiers in a camp. Gold and silver we will tell them that they have from
      God; the diviner metal is within them, and they have therefore no need of
      the dross which is current among men, and ought not to pollute the divine
      by any <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage417A">417</a></span>such earthly admixture; for that commoner metal has been the source
      of many unholy deeds, but their own is undefiled. And they alone of all
      the citizens may not touch or handle silver or gold, or be under the same
      roof with them, or wear them, or drink from them. And this will be their
      salvation, and they will be the saviours of the State. <span class="sidenote"> They must have no homes or property of their own.</span>But should they
      ever acquire homes or lands or moneys of their own, they will become
      housekeepers and husbandmen instead of guardians, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage417B">B</a></span>enemies and tyrants
      instead of allies of the other citizens; hating and being hated, plotting
      and being plotted against, they will pass their whole life in much greater
      terror of internal than of external enemies, and the hour of ruin, both to
      themselves and to the rest of the State, will be at hand. For all which
      reasons may we not say that thus shall our State be ordered, and that
      these shall be the regulations appointed by us for guardians concerning
      their houses and all other matters?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, said Glaucon.

      H<span class="smcap">ERE</span> Adeimantus interposed a question: How would you answer, Socrates,
      said he, if a person were to say that you are making<a href="#Footnotebook41" id="FnAnchorbook41" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">1</span></a> these people
      miserable, and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness; the city
      in fact belongs to them, but they are none the better for it; whereas
      other men acquire lands, and build large and handsome houses, and have
      everything handsome about them, offering sacrifices to the gods on their
      own account, and practising hospitality; moreover, as you were saying just
      now, they have gold and silver, and all that is usual among the favourites
      of fortune; but our poor citizens are no better than mercenaries who are
      quartered in the city and are always mounting guard?
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook41"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook41" class="pginternal">1</a></span>Or, ‘that for their own good you are making these people miserable.’</p></div>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage420A">420</a></span><span class="sidenote">and worst of all, adds Socrates, they have no money.</span>
      Yes, I said; and you may add that they are only fed, and not paid in
      addition to their food, like other men; and therefore they cannot, if they
      would, take a journey of pleasure; they have no money to spend on a
      mistress or any other luxurious fancy, which, as the world goes, is
      thought to be happiness; and many other accusations of the same nature
      might be added.
    </p>
<p>
      But, said he, let us suppose all this to be included in the charge.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage420B">B</a></span>
      You mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Yet very likely they may be the happiest of mankind.</span>
      If we proceed along the old path, my belief, I said, is that we shall find
      the answer. And our answer will be that, even as they are, our guardians
      may very likely be the happiest of men; but that our aim in founding the
      State was not the disproportionate happiness of any one class, but the
      greatest happiness of the whole; we thought that in a State <span class="pagenum"><a id="page108"></a>108</span> which is
      ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should be most likely to
      find justice, and in the ill-ordered <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage420C">C</a></span>State injustice: and, having found
      them, we might then decide which of the two is the happier. At present, I
      take it, we are fashioning the happy State, not piecemeal, or with a view
      of making a few happy citizens, but as a whole; and by-and-by we will
      proceed to view the opposite kind of State. <span class="sidenote">The State, like a statue, must be judged of as a whole.</span>Suppose that we were painting
      a statue, and some one came up to us and said, Why do you not put the most
      beautiful colours on the most beautiful parts of the body—the eyes
      ought to be purple, but you have made them black—to him <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage420D">D</a></span>we might
      fairly answer, Sir, you would not surely have us beautify the eyes to such
      a degree that they are no longer eyes; consider rather whether, by giving
      this and the other features their due proportion, we make the whole
      beautiful. And so I say to you, do not compel us to assign to the
      guardians a sort of happiness which will make them anything but guardians;
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage420E">E</a></span>for we too can clothe our husbandmen in royal apparel, and set crowns of
      gold on their heads, and bid them till the ground as much as they like,
      and no more. Our potters also might be allowed to repose on couches, and
      feast by the fireside, passing round the winecup, while their wheel is
      conveniently at hand, and working at pottery only as much as they like; in
      this way we might make every class happy—and then, as you imagine,
      the whole State would be happy. But do not put this idea into our heads;
      for, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage421A">421</a></span>if we listen to you, the husbandman will be no longer a husbandman,
      the potter will cease to be a potter, and no one will have the character
      of any distinct class in the State. Now this is not of much consequence
      where the corruption of society, and pretension to be what you are not, is
      confined to cobblers; but when the guardians of the laws and of the
      government are only seeming and not real guardians, then see how they turn
      the State upside down; and on the other hand they alone have the power of
      giving order and happiness to the State. <span class="sidenote">The guardians must be guardians, not boon companions.</span>We mean our guardians to be true
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage421B">B</a></span>saviours and not the destroyers of the State, whereas our opponent is
      thinking of peasants at a festival, who are enjoying a life of revelry,
      not of citizens who are doing their duty to the State. But, if so, we mean
      different things, and he is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page109"></a>109</span> speaking of something which is not a State.
      And therefore we must consider whether in appointing our guardians we
      would look to their greatest happiness individually, or whether this
      principle of happiness does not rather reside in the State as a whole. But
      if the latter be the truth, then the guardians <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage421C">C</a></span>and auxiliaries, and all
      others equally with them, must be compelled or induced to do their own
      work in the best way. And thus the whole State will grow up in a noble
      order, and the several classes will receive the proportion of happiness
      which nature assigns to them.
    </p>
<p>
      I think that you are quite right.
    </p>
<p>
      I wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs to me.
    </p>
<p>
      What may that be?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage421D">D</a></span>
      There seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts.
    </p>
<p>
      What are they?
    </p>
<p>
      Wealth, I said, and poverty.
    </p>
<p>
      How do they act?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">When an artisan
grows rich, he becomes careless: if he is very poor, he has no money to
buy tools with. The city should be neither poor nor rich.</span>
      The process is as follows: When a potter becomes rich, will he, think you,
      any longer take the same pains with his art?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      He will grow more and more indolent and careless?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And the result will be that he becomes a worse potter?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes; he greatly deteriorates.
    </p>
<p>
      But, on the other hand, if he has no money, and cannot provide himself
      with tools or instruments, he will not work <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage421E">E</a></span>equally well himself, nor will
      he teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, under the influence either of poverty or of wealth, workmen and
      their work are equally liable to degenerate?
    </p>
<p>
      That is evident.
    </p>
<p>
      Here, then, is a discovery of new evils, I said, against which the
      guardians will have to watch, or they will creep into the city unobserved.
    </p>
<p>
      What evils?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage422A">422</a></span>
      Wealth, I said, and poverty; the one is the parent of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page110"></a>110</span> luxury and
      indolence, and the other of meanness and viciousness, and both of
      discontent.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">But how, being poor, can she contend against a wealthy enemy?</span>
      That is very true, he replied; but still I should like to know, Socrates,
      how our city will be able to go to war, especially against an enemy who is
      rich and powerful, if deprived of the sinews of war.
    </p>
<p>
      There would certainly be a difficulty, I replied, in going <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage422B">B</a></span>to war with one
      such enemy; but there is no difficulty where there are two of them.
    </p>
<p>
      How so? he asked.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Our wiry soldiers will be more than a match for their fat neighbours.</span>
      In the first place, I said, if we have to fight, our side will be trained
      warriors fighting against an army of rich men.
    </p>
<p>
      That is true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And do you not suppose, Adeimantus, that a single boxer who was perfect in
      his art would easily be a match for two stout and well-to-do gentlemen who
      were not boxers?
    </p>
<p>
      Hardly, if they came upon him at once.
    </p>
<p>
      What, now, I said, if he were able to run away and then <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage422C">C</a></span>turn and strike at
      the one who first came up? And supposing he were to do this several times
      under the heat of a scorching sun, might he not, being an expert, overturn
      more than one stout personage?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said, there would be nothing wonderful in that.
    </p>
<p>
      And yet rich men probably have a greater superiority in the science and
      practise of boxing than they have in military qualities.
    </p>
<p>
      Likely enough.
    </p>
<p>
      Then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or
      three times their own number?
    </p>
<p>
      I agree with you, for I think you right.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage422D">D</a></span><span class="sidenote">And they will have allies who will readily join on condition of receiving the spoil.</span>
      And suppose that, before engaging, our citizens send an embassy to one of
      the two cities, telling them what is the truth: Silver and gold we neither
      have nor are permitted to have, but you may; do you therefore come and
      help us in war, and take the spoils of the other city: Who, on hearing
      these words, would choose to fight against lean wiry dogs, rather than,
      with the dogs on their side, against fat and tender sheep?
    </p>
<p>
      That is not likely; and yet there might be a danger to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page111"></a>111</span> <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage422E">E</a></span>poor State if
      the wealth of many States were to be gathered into one.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">But many cities will conspire? No: they are divided in themselves.</span>
      But how simple of you to use the term State at all of any but our own!
    </p>
<p>
      Why so?
    </p>
<p>
      You ought to speak of other States in the plural number; not one of them
      is a city, but many cities, as they say in the game. For indeed any city,
      however small, is in fact divided into two, one the city of the poor, the
      other of the rich; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage423A">423</a></span>these are at war with one another; and in either there
      are many smaller divisions, and you would be altogether beside the mark if
      you treated them all as a single State. But if you deal with them as many,
      and give the wealth or power or persons of the one to the others, you will
      always have a great many friends and not many enemies. <span class="sidenote">Many states are contained in one</span>And your State,
      while the wise order which has now been prescribed continues to prevail in
      her, will be the greatest of States, I do not mean to say in reputation or
      appearance, but in deed and truth, though she number not more than a
      thousand defenders. A single State which is her equal you will hardly
      find, either <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage423B">B</a></span>among Hellenes or barbarians, though many that appear to be
      as great and many times greater.
    </p>
<p>
      That is most true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The limit to the size of the State the possibility of unity.</span>
      And what, I said, will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when they
      are considering the size of the State and the amount of territory which
      they are to include, and beyond which they will not go?
    </p>
<p>
      What limit would you propose?
    </p>
<p>
      I would allow the State to increase so far as is consistent with unity;
      that, I think, is the proper limit.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage423C">C</a></span>
      Very good, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Here then, I said, is another order which will have to be conveyed to our
      guardians: Let our city be accounted neither large nor small, but one and
      self-sufficing.
    </p>
<p>
      And surely, said he, this is not a very severe order which we impose upon
      them.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The duty of adjusting the citizens to the rank for which nature intended them.</span>
      And the other, said I, of which we were speaking before is lighter still,—I
      mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians when inferior,
      and of elevating into the rank <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage423D">D</a></span>of guardians the offspring of the lower
      classes, when naturally <span class="pagenum"><a id="page112"></a>112</span> superior. The intention was, that, in the case of
      the citizens generally, each individual should be put to the use for which
      nature intended him, one to one work, and then every man would do his own
      business, and be one and not many; and so the whole city would be one and
      not many.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; that is not so difficult.
    </p>
<p>
      The regulations which we are prescribing, my good Adeimantus, are not, as
      might be supposed, a number of great principles, but trifles all, if care
      be taken, as the saying is, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage423E">E</a></span>of the one great thing,—a thing,
      however, which I would rather call, not great, but sufficient for our
      purpose.
    </p>
<p>
      What may that be? he asked.
    </p>
<p>
      Education, I said, and nurture: If our citizens are well educated, and
      grow into sensible men, they will easily see their way through all these,
      as well as other matters which I omit; such, for example, as marriage, the
      possession of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage424A">424</a></span>women and the procreation of children, which will all follow
      the general principle that friends have all things in common, as the
      proverb says.
    </p>
<p>
      That will be the best way of settling them.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Good education has a cumulative force and affects the breed.</span>
      Also, I said, the State, if once started well, moves with accumulating
      force like a wheel. For good nurture and education implant good
      constitutions, and these good constitutions taking root in a good
      education improve more and more, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage424B">B</a></span>and this improvement affects the breed in
      man as in other animals.
    </p>
<p>
      Very possibly, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">No innovations to be made either in music or gymnastic.</span>
      Then to sum up: This is the point to which, above all, the attention of
      our rulers should be directed,—that music and gymnastic be preserved
      in their original form, and no innovation made. They must do their utmost
      to maintain them intact. And when any one says that mankind most regard

      they will be afraid that he may be praising, not new songs, but a new kind
      of song; and this ought not to be praised, or conceived to be the meaning
      of the poet; for any musical innovation is full of danger to the whole
      State, and ought to be prohibited. <span class="sidenote">Damon.</span>So Damon tells me, and I can quite
      believe <span class="pagenum"><a id="page113"></a>113</span> him;—he says that when modes of music change, the
      fundamental laws of the State always change with them.
    </p>

<p>
      Yes, said Adeimantus; and you may add my suffrage to Damon’s and your own.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage424D">D</a></span>
      Then, I said, our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress in
      music?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals in.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I replied, in the form of amusement; and at first sight it appears
      harmless.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The spirit of lawlessness, beginning in music, gradually pervades the whole of life.</span>
      Why, yes, he said, and there is no harm; were it not that little by little
      this spirit of licence, finding a home, imperceptibly penetrates into
      manners and customs; whence, issuing with greater force, it invades
      contracts between man and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage424E">E</a></span>man, and from contracts goes on to laws and
      constitutions, in utter recklessness, ending at last, Socrates, by an
      overthrow of all rights, private as well as public.
    </p>
<p>
      Is that true? I said.
    </p>
<p>
      That is my belief, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, as I was saying, our youth should be trained from the first in a
      stricter system, for if amusements become <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage425A">425</a></span>lawless, and the youths
      themselves become lawless, they can never grow up into well-conducted and
      virtuous citizens.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The habit of order the basis of education.</span>
      And when they have made a good beginning in play, and by the help of music
      have gained the habit of good order, then this habit of order, in a manner
      how unlike the lawless play of the others! will accompany them in all
      their actions and be a principle of growth to them, and if there be any
      fallen places in the State will raise them up again.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">If the citizens have the root of the matter in them, they will supply the details for themselves.</span>
      Thus educated, they will invent for themselves any lesser rules which
      their predecessors have altogether neglected.
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage425B">B</a></span>
      I mean such things as these:—when the young are to be silent before
      their elders; how they are to show respect to them by standing and making
      them sit; what honour is due to parents; what garments or shoes are to be
      worn; the mode of dressing the hair; deportment and manners in general.
      You would agree with me? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page114"></a>114</span>
</p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      But there is, I think, small wisdom in legislating about such matters,—I
      doubt if it is ever done; nor are any precise written enactments about
      them likely to be lasting.
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      It would seem, Adeimantus, that the direction in which <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage425C">C</a></span>education starts a
      man, will determine his future life. Does not like always attract like?
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure.
    </p>
<p>
      Until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good, and may
      be the reverse of good?
    </p>
<p>
      That is not to be denied.
    </p>
<p>
      And for this reason, I said, I shall not attempt to legislate further
      about them.
    </p>
<p>
      Naturally enough, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The mere routine of administration may be omitted by us.</span>
      Well, and about the business of the agora, and the ordinary dealings
      between man and man, or again about agreements <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage425D">D</a></span>with artisans; about insult
      and injury, or the commencement of actions, and the appointment of juries,
      what would you say? there may also arise questions about any impositions
      and exactions of market and harbour dues which may be required, and in
      general about the regulations of markets, police, harbours, and the like.
      But, oh heavens! shall we condescend to legislate on any of these
      particulars?
    </p>
<p>
      I think, he said, that there is no need to impose laws about <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage425E">E</a></span>them on good
      men; what regulations are necessary they will find out soon enough for
      themselves.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, my friend, if God will only preserve to them the laws which
      we have given them.
    </p>
<p>
      And without divine help, said Adeimantus, they will go on for ever making
      and mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining
      perfection.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Illustration of reformers of the law taken from invalids who are always doctoring themselves, but will never listen to the truth.</span>
      You would compare them, I said, to those invalids who, having no
      self-restraint, will not leave off their habits of intemperance?
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage426A">426</a></span>
      Yes, I said; and what a delightful life they lead! they are always
      doctoring and increasing and complicating their disorders, and always
      fancying that they will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises them
      to try. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page115"></a>115</span>
</p>
<p>
      Such cases are very common, he said, with invalids of this sort.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I replied; and the charming thing is that they deem him their worst
      enemy who tells them the truth, which is simply that, unless they give up
      eating and drinking and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage426B">B</a></span>wenching and idling, neither drug nor cautery nor
      spell nor amulet nor any other remedy will avail.
    </p>
<p>
      Charming! he replied. I see nothing charming in going into a passion with
      a man who tells you what is right.
    </p>
<p>
      These gentlemen, I said, do not seem to be in your good graces.
    </p>
<p>
      Assuredly not.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor would you praise the behaviour of States which act like the men whom I
      was just now describing. For are there not ill-ordered States in which the
      citizens are forbidden <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage426C">C</a></span>under pain of death to alter the constitution; and
      yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under this regime and
      indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in anticipating and
      gratifying their humours is held to be a great and good statesman—do
      not these States resemble the persons whom I was describing?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; the States are as bad as the men; and I am very far from
      praising them.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage426D">D</a></span>
      But do you not admire, I said, the coolness and dexterity of these ready
      ministers of political corruption?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Demagogues trying their hands at legislation may be excused for their ignorance of the world.</span>
      Yes, he said, I do; but not of all of them, for there are some whom the
      applause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they are really
      statesmen, and these are not much to be admired.
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean? I said; you should have more feeling for them. When a
      man cannot measure, and a great many <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage426E">E</a></span>others who cannot measure declare
      that he is four cubits high, can he help believing what they say?
    </p>
<p>
      Nay, he said, certainly not in that case.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, then, do not be angry with them; for are they not as good as a play,
      trying their hand at paltry reforms such as I was describing; they are
      always fancying that by legislation they will make an end of frauds in
      contracts, and the other rascalities which I was mentioning, not knowing
      that they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page116"></a>116</span>
</p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage427A">427</a></span>
      Yes, he said; that is just what they are doing.
    </p>
<p>
      I conceive, I said, that the true legislator will not trouble himself with
      this class of enactments whether concerning laws or the constitution
      either in an ill-ordered or in a well-ordered State; for in the former
      they are quite useless, and in the latter there will be no difficulty in
      devising them; and many of them will naturally flow out of our previous
      regulations.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage427B">B</a></span>
      What, then, he said, is still remaining to us of the work of legislation?
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing to us, I replied; but to Apollo, the God of Delphi, there remains
      the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of all.
    </p>
<p>
      Which are they? he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Religion to be left to the God of Delphi.</span>
      The institution of temples and sacrifices, and the entire service of gods,
      demigods, and heroes; also the ordering of the repositories of the dead,
      and the rites which have to be observed by him who would propitiate the
      inhabitants of the world below. These are matters of which we are ignorant
      ourselves, and as founders of a city we should be <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage427C">C</a></span>unwise in trusting them
      to any interpreter but our ancestral deity. He is the god who sits in the
      centre, on the navel of the earth, and he is the interpreter of religion
      to all mankind.
    </p>
<p>
      You are right, and we will do as you propose.
    </p>
<p>
      But where, amid all this, is justice? son of Ariston, tell me where. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage427D">D</a></span>Now
      that our city has been made habitable, light a candle and search, and get
      your brother and Polemarchus and the rest of our friends to help, and let
      us see where in it we can discover justice and where injustice, and in
      what they differ from one another, and which of them the man who would be
      happy should have for his portion, whether seen or unseen by gods and men.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, G<span class="smcap">LAUCON</span>.</span>
      Nonsense, said Glaucon: did you not promise to search <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage427E">E</a></span>yourself, saying
      that for you not to help justice in her need would be an impiety?
    </p>
<p>
      I do not deny that I said so, and as you remind me, I will be as good as
      my word; but you must join.
    </p>
<p>
      We will, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, then, I hope to make the discovery in this way: <span class="pagenum"><a id="page117"></a>117</span> I mean to begin with
      the assumption that our State, if rightly ordered, is perfect.
    </p>
<p>
      That is most certain.
    </p>
<p>
      And being perfect, is therefore wise and valiant and temperate and just.
    </p>
<p>
      That is likewise clear.
    </p>
<p>
      And whichever of these qualities we find in the State, the one which is
      not found will be the residue?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage428A">428</a></span>
      Very good.
    </p>
<p>
      If there were four things, and we were searching for one of them, wherever
      it might be, the one sought for might be known to us from the first, and
      there would be no further trouble; or we might know the other three first,
      and then the fourth would clearly be the one left.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues, which are
      also four in number?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The place of the virtues in the State: (1) The wisdom of the statesman advises, not about particular arts or pursuits,</span>
      First among the virtues found in the State, wisdom comes <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage428B">B</a></span>into view, and in
      this I detect a certain peculiarity.
    </p>
<p>
      What is that?
    </p>
<p>
      The State which we have been describing is said to be wise as being good
      in counsel?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance, but
      by knowledge, do men counsel well?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      And the kinds of knowledge in a State are many and diverse?
    </p>
<p>
      Of course.
    </p>
<p>
      There is the knowledge of the carpenter; but is that the sort of knowledge
      which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage428C">C</a></span>
      Certainly not; that would only give a city the reputation of skill in
      carpentering.
    </p>
<p>
      Then a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge which
      counsels for the best about wooden implements?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen <span class="pagenum"><a id="page118"></a>118</span> pots, I said, nor
      as possessing any other similar knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      Not by reason of any of them, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth; that would
      give the city the name of agricultural?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">but about the whole State.</span>
      Well, I said, and is there any knowledge in our recently-founded State
      among any of the citizens which advises, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage428D">D</a></span>not about any particular thing in
      the State, but about the whole, and considers how a State can best deal
      with itself and with other States?
    </p>
<p>
      There certainly is.
    </p>
<p>
      And what is this knowledge, and among whom is it found? I asked.
    </p>
<p>
      It is the knowledge of the guardians, he replied, and is found among those
      whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians.
    </p>
<p>
      And what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this
      sort of knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      The name of good in counsel and truly wise.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage428E">E</a></span><span class="sidenote">The statesmen or guardians are the smallest of all classes in the State.</span>
      And will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more smiths?
    </p>
<p>
      The smiths, he replied, will be far more numerous.
    </p>
<p>
      Will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a
      name from the profession of some kind of knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      Much the smallest.
    </p>
<p>
      And so by reason of the smallest part or class, and of the knowledge which
      resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself, the whole State,
      being thus constituted according to <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage429A">429</a></span>nature, will be wise; and this, which
      has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom, has been ordained by
      nature to be of all classes the least.
    </p>
<p>
      Most true.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus, then, I said, the nature and place in the State of one of the four
      virtues has somehow or other been discovered.
    </p>
<p>
      And, in my humble opinion, very satisfactorily discovered, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Again, I said, there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page119"></a>119</span> courage, and
      in what part that quality resides which gives the name of courageous to
      the State.
    </p>
<p>
      How do you mean?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage429B">B</a></span><span class="sidenote">(2) The courage which makes the city courageous is found chiefly in the soldier.</span>
      Why, I said, every one who calls any State courageous or cowardly, will be
      thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the State’s
      behalf.
    </p>
<p>
      No one, he replied, would ever think of any other.
    </p>
<p>
      The rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly, but their
      courage or cowardice will not, as I conceive, have the effect of making
      the city either the one or the other.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">It is the quality which preserves right opinion about things to be feared and not to be feared.</span>
      The city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself which
      preserves under all circumstances that opinion <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage429C">C</a></span>about the nature of things
      to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator educated them;
      and this is what you term courage.
    </p>
<p>
      I should like to hear what you are saying once more, for I do not think
      that I perfectly understand you.
    </p>
<p>
      I mean that courage is a kind of salvation.
    </p>
<p>
      Salvation of what?
    </p>
<p>
      Of the opinion respecting things to be feared, what they are and of what
      nature, which the law implants through education; and I mean by the words
      ‘under all circumstances’ <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage429D">D</a></span>to intimate that in pleasure or in pain, or
      under the influence of desire or fear, a man preserves, and does not lose
      this opinion. Shall I give you an illustration?
    </p>
<p>
      If you please.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Illustration from the art of dyeing.</span>
      You know, I said, that dyers, when they want to dye wool for making the
      true sea-purple, begin by selecting their white colour first; this they
      prepare and dress with much care and pains, in order that the white ground
      may take the purple hue in full perfection. The dyeing then proceeds; and
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage429E">E</a></span>whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast colour, and no washing
      either with lyes or without them can take away the bloom. But, when the
      ground has not been duly prepared, you will have noticed how poor is the
      look either of purple or of any other colour.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; I know that they have a washed-out and ridiculous
      appearance. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page120"></a>120</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Our soldiers must take the dye of the laws.</span>
      Then now, I said, you will understand what our object was <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage430A">430</a></span>in selecting our
      soldiers, and educating them in music and gymnastic; we were contriving
      influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the laws in
      perfection, and the colour of their opinion about dangers and of every
      other opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture and training, not
      to be washed away by such potent lyes as pleasure—mightier agent far
      in washing the soul than any soda or lye; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage430B">B</a></span>or by sorrow, fear, and desire,
      the mightiest of all other solvents. And this sort of universal saving
      power of true opinion in conformity with law about real and false dangers
      I call and maintain to be courage, unless you disagree.
    </p>
<p>
      But I agree, he replied; for I suppose that you mean to exclude mere
      uninstructed courage, such as that of a wild beast or of a slave—this,
      in your opinion, is not the courage which the law ordains, and ought to
      have another name.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage430C">C</a></span>
      Most certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Then I may infer courage to be such as you describe?
    </p>
<p>
      Why, yes, said I, you may, and if you add the words ‘of a citizen,’ you
      will not be far wrong;—hereafter, if you like, we will carry the
      examination further, but at present we are seeking not for courage but
      justice; and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough.
    </p>
<p>
      You are right, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Two other virtues, temperance and justice, which must be considered in their proper order.</span>
      Two virtues remain to be discovered in the State—first, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage430D">D</a></span>temperance,
      and then justice which is the end of our search.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      Now, can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance?
    </p>
<p>
      I do not know how that can be accomplished, he said, nor do I desire that
      justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of; and
      therefore I wish that you would do me the favour of considering temperance
      first.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage430E">E</a></span>
      Certainly, I replied, I should not be justified in refusing your request.
    </p>
<p>
      Then consider, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I replied; I will; and as far as I can at present see, the virtue of
      temperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than the
      preceding.
    </p>
<p>
      How so? he asked. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page121"></a>121</span>
</p>
<p>
      Temperance, I replied, is the ordering or controlling of certain pleasures
      and desires; this is curiously enough implied in the saying of ‘a man
      being his own master;’ and other traces of the same notion may be found in
      language.
    </p>
<p>
      No doubt, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The temperate is master of himself, but the same person, when intemperate, is also the slave of himself.</span>
      There is something ridiculous in the expression ‘master of himself;’ <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage431A">431</a></span>for
      the master is also the servant and the servant the master; and in all
      these modes of speaking the same person is denoted.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      The meaning is, I believe, that in the human soul there is a better and
      also a worse principle; and when the better has the worse under control,
      then a man is said to be master of himself; and this is a term of praise:
      but when, owing to evil education or association, the better principle,
      which is also the smaller, is overwhelmed by the greater mass of the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage431B">B</a></span>worse—in
      this case he is blamed and is called the slave of self and unprincipled.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, there is reason in that.
    </p>
<p>
      And now, I said, look at our newly-created State, and there you will find
      one of these two conditions realized; for the State, as you will
      acknowledge, may be justly called master of itself, if the words
      ‘temperance’ and ‘self-mastery’ truly express the rule of the better part
      over the worse.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, I see that what you say is true.
    </p>
<p>
      Let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage431C">C</a></span>and desires
      and pains are generally found in children and women and servants, and in
      the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous class.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Whereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason, and are under
      the guidance of mind and true opinion, are to be found only in a few, and
      those the best born and best educated.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The State which has the passions and desires of the many controlled by the few may be rightly called temperate.</span>
      These two, as you may perceive, have a place in our State; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage431D">D</a></span>and the meaner
      desires of the many are held down by the virtuous desires and wisdom of
      the few.
    </p>
<p>
      That I perceive, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then if there be any city which may be described as <span class="pagenum"><a id="page122"></a>122</span> master of its own
      pleasures and desires, and master of itself, ours may claim such a
      designation?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      It may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And if there be any State in which rulers and subjects will <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage431E">E</a></span>be agreed as
      to the question who are to rule, that again will be our State?
    </p>
<p>
      Undoubtedly.
    </p>
<p>
      And the citizens being thus agreed among themselves, in which class will
      temperance be found—in the rulers or in the subjects?
    </p>
<p>
      In both, as I should imagine, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance was
      a sort of harmony?
    </p>
<p>
      Why so?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Temperance resides in the whole State.</span>
      Why, because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom, each of which
      resides in a part only, the one making the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage432A">432</a></span>State wise and the other
      valiant; not so temperance, which extends to the whole, and runs through
      all the notes of the scale, and produces a harmony of the weaker and the
      stronger and the middle class, whether you suppose them to be stronger or
      weaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth, or anything else. Most
      truly then may we deem temperance to be the agreement of the naturally
      superior and inferior, as to the right to rule of either, both in states
      and individuals.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage432B">B</a></span>
      I entirely agree with you.
    </p>
<p>
      And so, I said, we may consider three out of the four virtues to have been
      discovered in our State. The last of those qualities which make a state
      virtuous must be justice, if we only knew what that was.
    </p>
<p>
      The inference is obvious.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Justice is not far off.</span>
      The time then has arrived, Glaucon, when, like huntsmen, we should
      surround the cover, and look sharp that justice does not steal away, and
      pass out of sight and escape us; for <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage432C">C</a></span>beyond a doubt she is somewhere in
      this country: watch therefore and strive to catch a sight of her, and if
      you see her first, let me know.
    </p>
<p>
      Would that I could! but you should regard me rather as <span class="pagenum"><a id="page123"></a>123</span> a follower who has
      just eyes enough to see what you show him—that is about as much as I
      am good for.
    </p>
<p>
      Offer up a prayer with me and follow.
    </p>
<p>
      I will, but you must show me the way.
    </p>
<p>
      Here is no path, I said, and the wood is dark and perplexing; still we
      must push on.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage432D">D</a></span>
      Let us push on.
    </p>
<p>
      Here I saw something: Halloo! I said, I begin to perceive a track, and I
      believe that the quarry will not escape.
    </p>
<p>
      Good news, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Truly, I said, we are stupid fellows.
    </p>
<p>
      Why so?
    </p>
<p>
      Why, my good sir, at the beginning of our enquiry, ages ago, there was
      justice tumbling out at our feet, and we never saw her; nothing could be
      more ridiculous. Like people who go about looking for what they have in
      their hands—<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage432E">E</a></span>that was the way with us—we looked not at what we
      were seeking, but at what was far off in the distance; and therefore, I
      suppose, we missed her.
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      I mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been talking of
      justice, and have failed to recognise her.
    </p>
<p>
      I grow impatient at the length of your exordium.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage433A">433</a></span><span class="sidenote">We had already found her when we spoke of one man doing one thing only.</span>
      Well then, tell me, I said, whether I am right or not: You remember the
      original principle which we were always laying down at the foundation of
      the State, that one man should practise one thing only, the thing to which
      his nature was best adapted;—now justice is this principle or a part
      of it.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, we often said that one man should do one thing only.
    </p>
<p>
      Further, we affirmed that justice was doing one’s own business, and not
      being a busybody; we said so again and again, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage433B">B</a></span>and many others have said
      the same to us.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, we said so.
    </p>
<p>
      Then to do one’s own business in a certain way may be assumed to be
      justice. Can you tell me whence I derive this inference?
    </p>
<p>
      I cannot, but I should like to be told.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">From another point of view Justice is the residue of the three others.</span>
      Because I think that this is the only virtue which remains in the State
      when the other virtues of temperance and courage and wisdom are
      abstracted; and, that this is the ultimate <span class="pagenum"><a id="page124"></a>124</span> cause and condition of the
      existence of all of them, and while remaining in them is also their
      preservative; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage433C">C</a></span>and we were saying that if the three were discovered by us,
      justice would be the fourth or remaining one.
    </p>
<p>
      That follows of necessity.
    </p>
<p>
      If we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its presence
      contributes most to the excellence of the State, whether the agreement of
      rulers and subjects, or the preservation in the soldiers of the opinion
      which the law ordains about the true nature of dangers, or wisdom and
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage433D">D</a></span>watchfulness in the rulers, or whether this other which I am mentioning,
      and which is found in children and women, slave and freeman, artisan,
      ruler, subject,—the quality, I mean, of every one doing his own
      work, and not being a busybody, would claim the palm—the question is
      not so easily answered.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he replied, there would be a difficulty in saying which.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the power of each individual in the State to do his own work appears
      to compete with the other political virtues, wisdom, temperance, courage.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And the virtue which enters into this competition is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage433E">E</a></span>justice?
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Our idea is confirmed by the administration of justice in lawsuits. No man is to have what is not his own.</span>
      Let us look at the question from another point of view: Are not the rulers
      in a State those to whom you would entrust the office of determining suits
      at law?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither take
      what is another’s, nor be deprived of what is his own?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes; that is their principle.
    </p>
<p>
      Which is a just principle?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Then on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having and doing
      what is a man’s own, and belongs to him?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage434A">434</a></span>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Illustration: Classes, like individuals, should not meddle with one another’s occupations.</span>
      Think, now, and say whether you agree with me or not. Suppose a carpenter
      to be doing the business of a cobbler, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page125"></a>125</span> or a cobbler of a carpenter; and
      suppose them to exchange their implements or their duties, or the same
      person to be doing the work of both, or whatever be the change; do you
      think that any great harm would result to the State?
    </p>
<p>
      Not much.
    </p>
<p>
      But when the cobbler or any other man whom nature <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage434B">B</a></span>designed to be a trader,
      having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number of his
      followers, or any like advantage, attempts to force his way into the class
      of warriors, or a warrior into that of legislators and guardians, for
      which he is unfitted, and either to take the implements or the duties of
      the other; or when one man is trader, legislator, and warrior all in one,
      then I think you will agree with me in saying that this interchange and
      this meddling of one with another is the ruin of the State.
    </p>
<p>
      Most true.
    </p>
<p>
      Seeing then, I said, that there are three distinct classes, any meddling
      of one with another, or the change of one into <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage434C">C</a></span>another, is the greatest
      harm to the State, and may be most justly termed evil-doing?
    </p>
<p>
      Precisely.
    </p>
<p>
      And the greatest degree of evil-doing to one’s own city would be termed by
      you injustice?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      This then is injustice; and on the other hand when the trader, the
      auxiliary, and the guardian each do their own business, that is justice,
      and will make the city just.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage434D">D</a></span>
      I agree with you.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">From the larger example of the State we will now return to the individual.</span>
      We will not, I said, be over-positive as yet; but if, on trial, this
      conception of justice be verified in the individual as well as in the
      State, there will be no longer any room for doubt; if it be not verified,
      we must have a fresh enquiry. First let us complete the old investigation,
      which we began, as you remember, under the impression that, if we could
      previously examine justice on the larger scale, there would be less
      difficulty in discerning her in the individual. That larger <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage434E">E</a></span>example
      appeared to be the State, and accordingly we constructed as good a one as
      we could, knowing well that in the good State justice would be found. Let
      the discovery which we made be now applied to the individual—if they
      agree, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page126"></a>126</span> we shall be satisfied; or, if there be a difference in the
      individual, we will come back to the State and have another <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage435A">435</a></span>trial of the
      theory. The friction of the two when rubbed together may possibly strike a
      light in which justice will shine forth, and the vision which is then
      revealed we will fix in our souls.
    </p>
<p>
      That will be in regular course; let us do as you say.
    </p>
<p>
      I proceeded to ask: When two things, a greater and less, are called by the
      same name, are they like or unlike in so far as they are called the same?
    </p>
<p>
      Like, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage435B">B</a></span>
      The just man then, if we regard the idea of justice only, will be like the
      just State?
    </p>
<p>
      He will.
    </p>
<p>
      And a State was thought by us to be just when the three classes in the
      State severally did their own business; and also thought to be temperate
      and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections and qualities
      of these same classes?
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And so of the individual; we may assume that he has the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage435C">C</a></span>same three
      principles in his own soul which are found in the State; and he may be
      rightly described in the same terms, because he is affected in the same
      manner?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">How can we decide whether or no the soul has three distinct principles?</span>
      Once more then, O my friend, we have alighted upon an easy question—whether
      the soul has these three principles or not?
    </p>
<p>
      An easy question! Nay, rather, Socrates, the proverb holds that hard is
      the good.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, I said; and I do not think that the method <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage435D">D</a></span>which we are
      employing is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question;
      <span class="sidenote">Our method is inadequate, and for a better and longer one we have not at present time.</span>the true method is another and a longer one. Still we may arrive at a
      solution not below the level of the previous enquiry.
    </p>
<p>
      May we not be satisfied with that? he said;—under the circumstances,
      I am quite content.
    </p>
<p>
      I too, I replied, shall be extremely well satisfied.
    </p>
<p>
      Then faint not in pursuing the speculation, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage435E">E</a></span>
      Must we not acknowledge, I said, that in each of us there <span class="pagenum"><a id="page127"></a>127</span> are the same
      principles and habits which there are in the State; and that from the
      individual they pass into the State?—how else can they come there?
      Take the quality of passion or spirit;—it would be ridiculous to
      imagine that this quality, when found in States, is not derived from the
      individuals who are supposed to possess it, e.g. the Thracians, Scythians,
      and in general the northern nations; and the same may be said of the love
      of knowledge, which is the special characteristic of our part of the
      world, or of the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage436A">436</a></span>love of money, which may, with equal truth, be attributed
      to the Phoenicians and Egyptians.
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly so, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      There is no difficulty in understanding this.
    </p>
<p>
      None whatever.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">A digression in which an attempt is made to attain logical clearness.</span>
      But the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether these
      principles are three or one; whether, that is to say, we learn with one
      part of our nature, are angry with another, and with a third part desire
      the satisfaction <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage436B">B</a></span>of our natural appetites; or whether the whole soul comes
      into play in each sort of action—to determine that is the
      difficulty.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; there lies the difficulty.
    </p>
<p>
      Then let us now try and determine whether they are the same or different.
    </p>
<p>
      How can we? he asked.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The criterion of truth: Nothing can be and not be at the same time in the same relation.</span>
      I replied as follows: The same thing clearly cannot act or be acted upon
      in the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same time, in
      contrary ways; and therefore whenever this contradiction occurs in things
      apparently the same, we know that they are really not the same, but
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage436C">C</a></span>different.
    </p>
<p>
      Good.
    </p>
<p>
      For example, I said, can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the
      same time in the same part?
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      Still, I said, let us have a more precise statement of terms, lest we
      should hereafter fall out by the way. Imagine the case of a man who is
      standing and also moving his hands and his head, and suppose a person to
      say that one and the same person is in motion and at rest at the same
      moment<span class="pagenum"><a id="page128"></a>128</span>—to such a mode of speech we should object, and should <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage436D">D</a></span>rather
      say that one part of him is in motion while another is at rest.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Anticipation of objections to this ‘law of thought.’</span>
      And suppose the objector to refine still further, and to draw the nice
      distinction that not only parts of tops, but whole tops, when they spin
      round with their pegs fixed on the spot, are at rest and in motion at the
      same time (and he may say the same of anything which revolves in the same
      spot), his objection would not be admitted by us, because <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage436E">E</a></span>in such cases
      things are not at rest and in motion in the same parts of themselves; we
      should rather say that they have both an axis and a circumference, and
      that the axis stands still, for there is no deviation from the
      perpendicular; and that the circumference goes round. But if, while
      revolving, the axis inclines either to the right or left, forwards or
      backwards, then in no point of view can they be at rest.
    </p>
<p>
      That is the correct mode of describing them, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Then none of these objections will confuse us, or incline us to believe
      that the same thing at the same time, in the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage437A">437</a></span>same part or in relation to
      the same thing, can act or be acted upon in contrary ways.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not, according to my way of thinking.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet, I said, that we may not be compelled to examine all such objections,
      and prove at length that they are untrue, let us assume their absurdity,
      and go forward on the understanding that hereafter, if this assumption
      turn out to be untrue, all the consequences which follow shall be
      withdrawn.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that will be the best way.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage437B">B</a></span><span class="sidenote">Likes and dislikes exist in many forms.</span>
      Well, I said, would you not allow that assent and dissent, desire and
      aversion, attraction and repulsion, are all of them opposites, whether
      they are regarded as active or passive (for that makes no difference in
      the fact of their opposition)?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, they are opposites.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, I said, and hunger and thirst, and the desires in general, and again
      willing and wishing,—all these you would <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage437C">C</a></span>refer to the classes
      already mentioned. You would say—would you not?—that the soul
      of him who desires is seeking <span class="pagenum"><a id="page129"></a>129</span> after the object of his desire; or that he
      is drawing to himself the thing which he wishes to possess: or again, when
      a person wants anything to be given him, his mind, longing for the
      realization of his desire, intimates his wish to have it by a nod of
      assent, as if he had been asked a question?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence of
      desire; should not these be referred to the opposite class of repulsion
      and rejection?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage437D">D</a></span>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Admitting this to be true of desire generally, let us suppose a particular
      class of desires, and out of these we will select hunger and thirst, as
      they are termed, which are the most obvious of them?
    </p>
<p>
      Let us take that class, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      The object of one is food, and of the other drink?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">There may be simple thirst or qualified thirst, having respectively a simple or a qualified object.</span>
      And here comes the point: is not thirst the desire which the soul has of
      drink, and of drink only; not of drink qualified by anything else; for
      example, warm or cold, or much or little, or, in a word, drink of any
      particular sort: but if the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage437E">E</a></span>thirst be accompanied by heat, then the desire
      is of cold drink; or, if accompanied by cold, then of warm drink; or, if
      the thirst be excessive, then the drink which is desired will be
      excessive; or, if not great, the quantity of drink will also be small: but
      thirst pure and simple will desire drink pure and simple, which is the
      natural satisfaction of thirst, as food is of hunger?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; the simple desire is, as you say, in every case of the
      simple object, and the qualified desire of the qualified object.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage438A">438</a></span><span class="sidenote">Exception: The term good expresses, not a particular, but an universal relation.</span>
      But here a confusion may arise; and I should wish to guard against an
      opponent starting up and saying that no man desires drink only, but good
      drink, or food only, but good food; for good is the universal object of
      desire, and thirst being a desire, will necessarily be thirst after good
      drink; and the same is true of every other desire.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he replied, the opponent might have something to say.
    </p>
<p>
      Nevertheless I should still maintain, that of relatives some <span class="pagenum"><a id="page130"></a>130</span> <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage438B">B</a></span>have a
      quality attached to either term of the relation; others are simple and
      have their correlatives simple.
    </p>
<p>
      I do not know what you mean.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Illustration of the argument from the use of language about correlative terms.</span>
      Well, you know of course that the greater is relative to the less?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And the much greater to the much less?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And the sometime greater to the sometime less, and the greater that is to
      be to the less that is to be?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage438C">C</a></span>
      And so of more and less, and of other correlative terms, such as the
      double and the half, or again, the heavier and the lighter, the swifter
      and the slower; and of hot and cold, and of any other relatives;—is
      not this true of all of them?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And does not the same principle hold in the sciences? The object of
      science is knowledge (assuming that to be the true definition), but the
      object of a particular science is a <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage438D">D</a></span>particular kind of knowledge; I mean,
      for example, that the science of house-building is a kind of knowledge
      which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and is therefore
      termed architecture.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Because it has a particular quality which no other has?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And it has this particular quality because it has an object of a
      particular kind; and this is true of the other arts and sciences?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Recapitulation</span>
      Now, then, if I have made myself clear, you will understand my original
      meaning in what I said about relatives. My meaning was, that if one term
      of a relation is taken alone, the other is taken alone; if one term is
      qualified, the other is also qualified. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage438E">E</a></span><span class="sidenote">Anticipation of a possible confusion.</span>I do not mean to say that
      relatives may not be disparate, or that the science of health is healthy,
      or of disease necessarily diseased, or that the sciences of good and evil
      are therefore good and evil; but only that, when the term science is no
      longer used absolutely, but has a qualified object which in this case is
      the nature of health and disease, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page131"></a>131</span> it becomes defined, and is hence called
      not merely science, but the science of medicine.
    </p>
<p>
      I quite understand, and I think as you do.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage439A">439</a></span>
      Would you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative terms,
      having clearly a relation—
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, thirst is relative to drink.
    </p>
<p>
      And a certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of drink; but
      thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little, nor of good nor bad, nor
      of any particular kind of drink, but of drink only?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the soul of the thirsty one, in so far as he is thirsty, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage439B">B</a></span>desires only
      drink; for this he yearns and tries to obtain it?
    </p>
<p>
      That is plain.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The law of contradiction.</span>
      And if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from drink,
      that must be different from the thirsty principle which draws him like a
      beast to drink; for, as we were saying, the same thing cannot at the same
      time with the same part of itself act in contrary ways about the same.
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      No more than you can say that the hands of the archer push and pull the
      bow at the same time, but what you say is that one hand pushes and the
      other pulls.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage439C">C</a></span>
      Exactly so, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, it constantly happens.
    </p>
<p>
      And in such a case what is one to say? Would you not say that there was
      something in the soul bidding a man to drink, and something else
      forbidding him, which is other and stronger than the principle which bids
      him?
    </p>
<p>
      I should say so.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage439D">D</a></span><span class="sidenote">The opposition of desire and reason.</span>
      And the forbidding principle is derived from reason, and that which bids
      and attracts proceeds from passion and disease?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      Then we may fairly assume that they are two, and that they differ from one
      another; the one with which a man reasons, we may call the rational
      principle of the soul, the other, with which he loves and hungers and
      thirsts and feels the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page132"></a>132</span> flutterings of any other desire, may be termed the
      irrational or appetitive, the ally of sundry pleasures and satisfactions?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage439E">E</a></span>
      Yes, he said, we may fairly assume them to be different.
    </p>
<p>
      Then let us finally determine that there are two principles existing in
      the soul. And what of passion, or spirit? Is it a third, or akin to one of
      the preceding?
    </p>
<p>
      I should be inclined to say—akin to desire.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The third principle of spirit or passion illustrated by an example.</span>
      Well, I said, there is a story which I remember to have heard, and in
      which I put faith. The story is, that Leontius, the son of Aglaion, coming
      up one day from the Piraeus, under the north wall on the outside, observed
      some dead bodies lying on the ground at the place of execution. He felt a
      desire to see them, and also a dread and abhorrence of them; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage440A">440</a></span>for a time he
      struggled and covered his eyes, but at length the desire got the better of
      him; and forcing them open, he ran up to the dead bodies, saying, Look, ye
      wretches, take your fill of the fair sight.
    </p>
<p>
      I have heard the story myself, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      The moral of the tale is, that anger at times goes to war with desire, as
      though they were two distinct things.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes; that is the meaning, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And are there not many other cases in which we observe <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage440B">B</a></span>that when a man’s
      desires violently prevail over his reason, he reviles himself, and is
      angry at the violence within him, and that in this struggle, which is like
      the struggle of factions in a State, his spirit is on the side of his
      reason;—<span class="sidenote">Passion never takes part with desire against reason.</span>but for the passionate or spirited element to take part with
      the desires when reason decides that she should not be opposed<a href="#Footnotebook43" id="FnAnchorbook43" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">3</span></a>, is a sort
      of thing which I believe that you never observed occurring in yourself,
      nor, as I should imagine, in any one else?
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook43"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook43" class="pginternal">3</a></span> Reading <span class="transl" title="mê\ dei=n a)ntipra/tein">μὴ δεῖν ἀντιπράτειν</span>, without a comma after <span class="transl" title="dei=n">δεῖν</span>.</p></div>
<p>
      Certainly not.

<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage440C">C</a></span><span class="sidenote">Righteous indignation never felt by a person of noble character when he deservedly suffers.</span>
      Suppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another, the nobler he is
      the less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering, such as hunger, or
      cold, or any other pain which the injured person may inflict upon him—these
      he deems to be just, and, as I say, his anger refuses to be excited by
      them.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      But when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page133"></a>133</span> then he boils and
      chafes, and is on the side of what he believes to be justice; and because
      he suffers hunger or cold <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage440D">D</a></span>or other pain he is only the more determined to
      persevere and conquer. His noble spirit will not be quelled until he
      either slays or is slain; or until he hears the voice of the shepherd,
      that is, reason, bidding his dog bark no more.
    </p>
<p>
      The illustration is perfect, he replied; and in our State, as we were
      saying, the auxiliaries were to be dogs, and to hear the voice of the
      rulers, who are their shepherds.
    </p>
<p>
      I perceive, I said, that you quite understand me; there is, however, a
      further point which I wish you to consider.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage440E">E</a></span>
      What point?
    </p>
<p>
      You remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a kind
      of desire, but now we should say quite the contrary; for in the conflict
      of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational principle.
    </p>
<p>
      Most assuredly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Not two, but three principles in the soul, as in the State.</span>
      But a further question arises: Is passion different from reason also, or
      only a kind of reason; in which latter case, instead of three principles
      in the soul, there will only be two, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage441A">441</a></span>the rational and the concupiscent; or
      rather, as the State was composed of three classes, traders, auxiliaries,
      counsellors, so may there not be in the individual soul a third element
      which is passion or spirit, and when not corrupted by bad education is the
      natural auxiliary of reason?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, there must be a third.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I replied, if passion, which has already been shown to be different
      from desire, turn out also to be different from reason.
    </p>
<p>
      But that is easily proved:—We may observe even in young children
      that they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born, whereas some
      of them never seem to attain to <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage441B">B</a></span>the use of reason, and most of them late
      enough.
    </p>
<p>
      Excellent, I said, and you may see passion equally in brute animals, which
      is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying. <span class="sidenote">Appeal to Homer.</span>And we may once

      And so, after much tossing, we have reached land, and are fairly agreed

      individual, and that they are three in number.
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p>
      Must we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way, and in
      virtue of the same quality which makes the State wise?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage441D">D</a></span>
      Also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the State
      constitutes courage in the individual, and that both the State and the
      individual bear the same relation to all the other virtues?
    </p>
<p>
      Assuredly.
    </p>
<p>
      And the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same way
      in which the State is just?
    </p>
<p>
      That follows, of course.
    </p>
<p>
      We cannot but remember that the justice of the State <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage441E">E</a></span> consisted in each of
      the three classes doing the work of its own class?
    </p>
<p>
      We are not very likely to have forgotten, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      We must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of his
      nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own work?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, we must remember that too.
    </p>
<p>
      And ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care of
      the whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle to be

      instances will satisfy us of the truth of what I am saying.
    </p>
<p>
      What sort of instances do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      If the case is put to us, must we not admit that the just <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage443A">443</a></span>State, or the
      man who is trained in the principles of such a State, will be less likely
      than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver? Would any
      one deny this?
    </p>
<p>
      No one, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Will the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft, or
      treachery either to his friends or to his country?
    </p>
<p>
      Never.
    </p>
<p>
      Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or
      agreements?
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      No one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his father
      and mother, or to fail in his religious duties?
    </p>
<p>
      No one.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage443B">B</a></span>
      And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business, whether
      in ruling or being ruled?
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly so.
    </p>
<p>
      Are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such
      states is justice, or do you hope to discover some other?
    </p>
<p>
      Not I, indeed.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">We have realized the hope entertained in the first construction of the State.</span>
      Then our dream has been realized; and the suspicion which we entertained
      at the beginning of our work of construction, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage443C">C</a></span>that some divine power must
      have conducted us to a primary form of justice, has now been verified?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And the division of labour which required the carpenter and the shoemaker
      and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business, and not
      another’s, was a shadow of justice, and for that reason it was of use?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The three principles harmonize in one.</span>
      But in reality justice was such as we were describing, being concerned
      however, not with the outward man, but <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage443D">D</a></span>with the inward, which is the true
      self and concernment of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page137"></a>137</span> man: for the just man does not permit the several
      elements within him to interfere with one another, or any of them to do
      the work of others,—he sets in order his own inner life, and is his
      own master and his own law, and at peace with himself; <span class="sidenote">The harmony of human life.</span>and when he has
      bound together the three principles within him, which may be compared to
      the higher, lower, and middle notes of the scale, and the intermediate
      intervals—when he has bound all these together, and is no longer
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage443E">E</a></span>many, but has become one entirely temperate and perfectly adjusted nature,
      then he proceeds to act, if he has to act, whether in a matter of
      property, or in the treatment of the body, or in some affair of politics
      or private business; always thinking and calling that which preserves and
      co-operates with this harmonious condition, just and good action, and the
      knowledge which presides over it, wisdom, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage444A">444</a></span>and that which at any time
      impairs this condition, he will call unjust action, and the opinion which
      presides over it ignorance.
    </p>
<p>
      You have said the exact truth, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      Very good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man
      and the just State, and the nature of justice in each of them, we should
      not be telling a falsehood?
    </p>
<p>
      Most certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      May we say so, then?
    </p>
<p>
      Let us say so.
    </p>
<p>
      And now, I said, injustice has to be considered.
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage444B">B</a></span><span class="sidenote">Injustice the opposite of justice.</span>
      Must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three principles—a
      meddlesomeness, and interference, and rising up of a part of the soul
      against the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority, which is made by a
      rebellious subject against a true prince, of whom he is the natural
      vassal,—what is all this confusion and delusion but injustice, and
      intemperance and cowardice and ignorance, and every form of vice?
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly so.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage444C">C</a></span>
      And if the nature of justice and injustice be known, then the meaning of
      acting unjustly and being unjust, or, again, of acting justly, will also
      be perfectly clear?
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean? he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Analogy of body and soul.</span>
      Why, I said, they are like disease and health; being in the soul just what
      disease and health are in the body. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page138"></a>138</span>
</p>
<p>
      How so? he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Why, I said, that which is healthy causes health, and that which is
      unhealthy causes disease.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage444D">D</a></span>
      And just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause injustice?
    </p>
<p>
      That is certain.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Health : disease :: justice : injustice.</span>
      And the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and
      government of one by another in the parts of the body; and the creation of
      disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this
      natural order?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order and
      government of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the creation of
      injustice the production of a state of things at variance with the natural
      order?
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly so, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then virtue is the health and beauty and well-being of the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage444E">E</a></span>soul, and vice
      the disease and weakness and deformity of the same?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to vice?
    </p>
<p>
      Assuredly.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage445A">445</a></span><span class="sidenote">The old question, whether the just or the unjust is the happier, has become ridiculous.</span>
      Still our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and
      injustice has not been answered: Which is the more profitable, to be just
      and act justly and practise virtue, whether seen or unseen of gods and
      men, or to be unjust and act unjustly, if only unpunished and unreformed?
    </p>
<p>
      In my judgment, Socrates, the question has now become ridiculous. We know
      that, when the bodily constitution is gone, life is no longer endurable,
      though pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks, and having all wealth
      and all power; and shall we be told that when the very essence of the
      vital principle is undermined and corrupted, life is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage445B">B</a></span>still worth having to
      a man, if only he be allowed to do whatever he likes with the single
      exception that he is not to acquire justice and virtue, or to escape from
      injustice and vice; assuming them both to be such as we have described?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, the question is, as you say, ridiculous. Still, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page139"></a>139</span> as we are
      near the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner with
      our own eyes, let us not faint by the way.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage445C">C</a></span>
      Come up hither, I said, and behold the various forms of vice, those of
      them, I mean, which are worth looking at.
    </p>
<p>
      I am following you, he replied: proceed.
    </p>
<p>
      I said, The argument seems to have reached a height from which, as from
      some tower of speculation, a man may look down and see that virtue is one,
      but that the forms of vice are innumerable; there being four special ones
      which are deserving of note.
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean? he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">As many forms of the soul as of the State.</span>
      I mean, I replied, that there appear to be as many forms of the soul as
      there are distinct forms of the State.
    </p>
<p>
      How many?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage445D">D</a></span>
      There are five of the State, and five of the soul, I said.
    </p>
<p>
      What are they?
    </p>
<p>
      The first, I said, is that which we have been describing, and which may be
      said to have two names, monarchy and aristocracy, accordingly as rule is
      exercised by one distinguished man or by many.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      But I regard the two names as describing one form only; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage445E">E</a></span>for whether the
      government is in the hands of one or many, if the governors have been
      trained in the manner which we have supposed, the fundamental laws of the
      State will be maintained.
    </p>
<p>
      That is true, he replied.

      regulation of the individual soul, and is exhibited in four forms.

<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage449"></a></span><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage449B">B</a></span>
      I was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil  forms appeared
      to me to succeed one another, when Polemarchus, who was sitting a little
      way off, just beyond Adeimantus, began to whisper to him: stretching forth
      his hand, he took hold of the upper part of his coat by the shoulder, and
      drew him towards him, leaning forward himself so as to be quite close and
      saying something in his ear, of which I only caught the words, ‘Shall we
      let him off, or what shall we do?’
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not, said Adeimantus, raising his voice.
    </p>
<p>
      Who is it, I said, whom you are refusing to let off?
    </p>
<p>
      You, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage449C">C</a></span>
      I repeated<a href="#Footnotebook51" id="FnAnchorbook51" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">1</span></a>, Why am I especially not to be let off?

<p><span class="sidenote"> The saying ‘Friends have all things in common’ is an insufficient solution of the problem.</span>
      Why, he said, we think that you are lazy, and mean to cheat us out of a
      whole chapter which is a very important part of the story; and you fancy
      that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding; as if it were
      self-evident to everybody, that in the matter of women and children
      ‘friends have all things in common.’
    </p>
<p>
      And was I not right, Adeimantus?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; but what is right in this particular case, like everything
      else, requires to be explained; for community may be of many kinds.
      Please, therefore, to say what sort <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage449D">D</a></span>of community you mean. We have been
      long <span class="pagenum"><a id="page141"></a>141</span> expecting that you would tell us something about the family life of
      your citizens—how they will bring children into the world, and rear
      them when they have arrived, and, in general, what is the nature of this
      community of women and children—for we are of opinion that the right
      or wrong management of such matters will have a great and paramount
      influence on the State for good or for evil. And now, since the question
      is still undetermined, and you are taking in hand another <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage450A">450</a></span>State, we have
      resolved, as you heard, not to let you go until you give an account of all
      this.
    </p>
<p>
      To that resolution, said Glaucon, you may regard me as saying Agreed.
    </p>
<p>
<span class="sidenote">S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, T<span class="smcap">HRASYMACHUS</span>.</span>

      And without more ado, said Thrasymachus, you may consider us all to be
      equally agreed.
    </p>
<p>
      I said, You know not what you are doing in thus assailing me: What an
      argument are you raising about the State! <span class="sidenote"> The feigned surprise of Socrates.</span>Just as I thought that I had
      finished, and was only too glad that I had laid this question to sleep,
      and was reflecting how fortunate I was in your acceptance of what I then
      said, you ask me to begin again at the very foundation, ignorant of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage450B">B</a></span>what a
      hornet’s nest of words you are stirring. Now I foresaw this gathering
      trouble, and avoided it.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The good-humour of Thrasymachus.</span>
      For what purpose do you conceive that we have come here, said
      Thrasymachus,—to look for gold, or to hear discourse?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, but discourse should have a limit.
    </p><p>
<span class="sidenote"> S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, G<span class="smcap">LAUCON</span>.</span>

      Yes, Socrates, said Glaucon, and the whole of life is the only limit which
      wise men assign to the hearing of such discourses. But never mind about
      us; take heart yourself <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage450C">C</a></span> and answer the question in your own way: What sort
      of community of women and children is this which is to prevail among our
      guardians? and how shall we manage the period between birth and education,
      which seems to require the greatest care? Tell us how these things will
      be.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, my simple friend, but the answer is the reverse of easy; many more
      doubts arise about this than about our previous conclusions. For the
      practicability of what is said may be doubted; and looked at in another
      point of view, whether the scheme, if ever so practicable, would be for
      the best, is also doubtful. Hence I feel a reluctance to approach <span class="pagenum"><a id="page142"></a>142</span> the
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage450D">D</a></span>subject, lest our aspiration, my dear friend, should turn out to be a
      dream only.
    </p>
<p>
      Fear not, he replied, for your audience will not be hard upon you; they
      are not sceptical or hostile.
    </p>
<p>
      I said: My good friend, I suppose that you mean to encourage me by these
      words.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> A friendly audience is more dangerous than a hostile one.</span>
      Then let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse; the
      encouragement which you offer would have been all very well had I myself
      believed that I knew what I was talking about: to declare the truth about
      matters of high <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage450E">E</a></span>interest which a man honours and loves among wise men who
      love him need occasion no fear or faltering in his mind; but to carry on
      an argument when you are yourself only <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage451A">451</a></span>a hesitating enquirer, which is my
      condition, is a dangerous and slippery thing; and the danger is not that I
      shall be laughed at (of which the fear would be childish), but that I
      shall miss the truth where I have most need to be sure of my footing, and
      drag my friends after me in my fall. And I pray Nemesis not to visit upon
      me the words which I am going to utter. For I do indeed believe that to be
      an involuntary homicide is a less crime than to be a deceiver about beauty
      or goodness or justice in the matter of laws<a href="#Footnotebook52" id="FnAnchorbook52" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">2</span></a>. And that is a risk which I
      would rather run among enemies than among friends, and therefore you do
      well to encourage <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage451B">B</a></span>me<a href="#Footnotebook53" id="FnAnchorbook53" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">3</span></a>.
    </p>

<p>
      Glaucon laughed and said: Well then, Socrates, in case you and your
      argument do us any serious injury you shall be acquitted beforehand of the
      homicide, and shall not be held to be a deceiver; take courage then and
      speak.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, I said, the law says that when a man is acquitted he is free from
      guilt, and what holds at law may hold in argument.
    </p>
<p>
      Then why should you mind?
    </p>
<p>
      Well, I replied, I suppose that I must retrace my steps <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage451C">C</a></span>and say what I
      perhaps ought to have said before in the proper place. The part of the men
      has been played out, and now properly enough comes the turn of the women.
      Of them I will proceed to speak, and the more readily since I am invited
      by you. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page143"></a>143</span>
</p>
<p>
      For men born and educated like our citizens, the only way, in my opinion,
      of arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and use of women
      and children is to follow the path on which we originally started, when we
      said that the men were to be the guardians and watchdogs of the herd.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage451D">D</a></span>
      Let us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be subject
      to similar or nearly similar regulations; then we shall see whether the
      result accords with our design.
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> No distinction among the animals such as is made between men and women.</span>
      What I mean may be put into the form of a question, I said: Are dogs
      divided into hes and shes, or do they both share equally in hunting and in
      keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs? or do we entrust to the
      males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks, while we leave the
      females at home, under the idea that the bearing and suckling their
      puppies is labour enough for them?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage451E">E</a></span>
      No, he said, they share alike; the only difference between them is that
      the males are stronger and the females weaker.
    </p>
<p>
      But can you use different animals for the same purpose, unless they are
      bred and fed in the same way?
    </p>
<p>
      You cannot.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, if women are to have the same duties as men, they <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage452A">452</a></span>must have the same
      nurture and education?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      The education which was assigned to the men was music and gymnastic.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Women must be taught music, gymnastic, and military exercises
equally with men.</span>
      Then women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art of war,
      which they must practise like the men?
    </p>
<p>
      That is the inference, I suppose.
    </p>
<p>
      I should rather expect, I said, that several of our proposals, if they are
      carried out, being unusual, may appear ridiculous.
    </p>
<p>
      No doubt of it.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women naked
      in the palaestra, exercising with the men, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage452B">B</a></span>especially when they are no
      longer young; they certainly will not be a vision of beauty, any more than
      the enthusiastic <span class="pagenum"><a id="page144"></a>144</span> old men who in spite of wrinkles and ugliness continue to
      frequent the gymnasia.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, indeed, he said: according to present notions the proposal would be
      thought ridiculous.
    </p>
<p>
      But then, I said, as we have determined to speak our minds, we must not
      fear the jests of the wits which will be directed against this sort of
      innovation; how they will talk of women’s <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage452C">C</a></span>attainments both in music and
      gymnastic, and above all about their wearing armour and riding upon
      horseback!
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Convention should not be permitted to stand in the way of a higher good.</span>
      Yet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law; at the
      same time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life to be serious.
      Not long ago, as we shall remind them, the Hellenes were of the opinion,
      which is still generally received among the barbarians, that the sight of
      a naked man was ridiculous and improper; and when first the Cretans and
      then the Lacedaemonians introduced the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage452D">D</a></span>custom, the wits of that day might
      equally have ridiculed the innovation.
    </p>
<p>
      No doubt.
    </p>
<p>
      But when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was far
      better than to cover them up, and the ludicrous effect to the outward eye
      vanished before the better principle which reason asserted, then the man
      was perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of his ridicule at any
      other <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage452E">E</a></span>sight but that of folly and vice, or seriously inclines to weigh the
      beautiful by any other standard but that of the good<a href="#Footnotebook54" id="FnAnchorbook54" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">4</span></a>.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook54"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook54" class="pginternal">4</a></span> Reading with Paris A. <span class="transl" title="kai\ kalou= ...">καὶ καλοῦ …</span></p></div>
<p>
      Very true, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      First, then, whether the question is to be put in jest or in <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage453A">453</a></span>earnest, let
      us come to an understanding about the nature of woman: Is she capable of
      sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men, or not at all?
      And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share?
      That will be the best way of commencing the enquiry, and will probably
      lead to the fairest conclusion.
    </p>
<p>
      That will be much the best way.
    </p>
<p>
      Shall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against ourselves;
      in this manner the adversary’s position will not be undefended. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page145"></a>145</span>
</p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage453B">B</a></span>
      Why not? he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Objection: We were saying that every one should do his own work: Have not women and men severally a work of their own?</span>
      Then let us put a speech into the mouths of our opponents. They will say:
      ‘Socrates and Glaucon, no adversary need convict you, for you yourselves,
      at the first foundation of the State, admitted the principle that
      everybody was to do the one work suited to his own nature.’ And certainly,
      if I am not mistaken, such an admission was made by us. ‘And do not the
      natures of men and women differ very much indeed?’ And we shall reply: Of
      course they do. Then we shall be asked, ‘Whether the tasks assigned to men
      and to women should not be different, and such as are agreeable to their
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage453C">C</a></span>different natures?’ Certainly they should. ‘But if so, have you not fallen
      into a serious inconsistency in saying that men and women, whose natures
      are so entirely different, ought to perform the same actions?’—What
      defence will you make for us, my good Sir, against any one who offers
      these objections?
    </p>
<p>
      That is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly; and I shall
      and I do beg of you to draw out the case on our side.
    </p>
<p>
      These are the objections, Glaucon, and there are many <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage453D">D</a></span>others of a like
      kind, which I foresaw long ago; they made me afraid and reluctant to take
      in hand any law about the possession and nurture of women and children.
    </p>
<p>
      By Zeus, he said, the problem to be solved is anything but easy.
    </p>
<p>
      Why yes, I said, but the fact is that when a man is out of his depth,
      whether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into mid ocean, he
      has to swim all the same.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And must not we swim and try to reach the shore: we will hope that Arion’s
      dolphin or some other miraculous help may save us?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage453E">E</a></span>
      I suppose so, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Well then, let us see if any way of escape can be found. We acknowledged—did
      we not? that different natures ought to have different pursuits, and that
      men’s and women’s natures are different. And now what are we saying?—that
      different natures ought to have the same pursuits,—this is the
      inconsistency which is charged upon us. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page146"></a>146</span>
</p>
<p>
      Precisely.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage454A">454</a></span>
      Verily, Glaucon, I said, glorious is the power of the art of
      contradiction!
    </p>
<p>
      Why do you say so?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The seeming inconsistency arises out of a verbal opposition.</span>
      Because I think that many a man falls into the practice against his will.
      When he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing, just because
      he cannot define and divide, and so know that of which he is speaking; and
      he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit of contention and
      not of fair discussion.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he replied, such is very often the case; but what has that to do with
      us and our argument?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage454B">B</a></span>
      A great deal; for there is certainly a danger of our getting
      unintentionally into a verbal opposition.
    </p>
<p>
      In what way?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> When we assigned to different natures different pursuits, we meant only those differences of nature which affected the pursuits.</span>
      Why we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth, that
      different natures ought to have different pursuits, but we never
      considered at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of
      nature, or why we distinguished them when we assigned different pursuits
      to different natures and the same to the same natures.
    </p>
<p>
      Why, no, he said, that was never considered by us.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage454C">C</a></span>
      I said: Suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the question
      whether there is not an opposition in nature between bald men and hairy
      men; and if this is admitted by us, then, if bald men are cobblers, we
      should forbid the hairy men to be cobblers, and conversely?
    </p>
<p>
      That would be a jest, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, a jest; and why? because we never meant when we constructed
      the State, that the opposition of natures should extend to every
      difference, but only to those <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage454D">D</a></span>differences which affected the pursuit in
      which the individual is engaged; we should have argued, for example, that
      a physician and one who is in mind a physician<a href="#Footnotebook55" id="FnAnchorbook55" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">5</span></a> may be said to have the
      same nature.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook55"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook55" class="pginternal">5</a></span> Reading <span class="transl" title="i)atro\n me\n kai\ i)atriko\n tê\n psuchê\n o)/nta">ἰατρὸν μὲν καὶ ἰατρικὸν τὴν ψυχὴν ὄντα</span>.</p></div>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      Whereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page147"></a>147</span>
</p>
<p>
      And if, I said, the male and female sex appear to differ in their fitness
      for any art or pursuit, we should say that such pursuit or art ought to be
      assigned to one or the other of them; but if the difference consists only
      in women bearing <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage454E">E</a></span>and men begetting children, this does not amount to a
      proof that a woman differs from a man in respect of the sort of education
      she should receive; and we shall therefore continue to maintain that our
      guardians and their wives ought to have the same pursuits.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Next, we shall ask our opponent how, in reference to any <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage455A">455</a></span>of the pursuits
      or arts of civic life, the nature of a woman differs from that of a man?
    </p>
<p>
      That will be quite fair.
    </p>
<p>
      And perhaps he, like yourself, will reply that to give a sufficient answer
      on the instant is not easy; but after a little reflection there is no
      difficulty.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, perhaps.
    </p>
<p>
      Suppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage455B">B</a></span>argument, and then
      we may hope to show him that there is nothing peculiar in the constitution
      of women which would affect them in the administration of the State.
    </p>
<p>
      By all means.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The same natural gifts are found in both sexes, but they are possessed in a higher degree by men than women.</span>
      Let us say to him: Come now, and we will ask you a question:—when
      you spoke of a nature gifted or not gifted in any respect, did you mean to
      say that one man will acquire a thing easily, another with difficulty; a
      little learning will lead the one to discover a great deal; whereas the
      other, after much study and application, no sooner learns than he forgets;
      or again, did you mean, that the one has a body which is a good servant to
      his mind, while the body of the other is a hindrance to him?—would
      not these be the sort <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage455C">C</a></span>of differences which distinguish the man gifted by
      nature from the one who is ungifted?
    </p>
<p>
      No one will deny that.
    </p>
<p>
      And can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has not
      all these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female? Need I
      waste time in speaking of the art of weaving, and the management of
      pancakes and preserves, in which womankind does really appear to be <span class="pagenum"><a id="page148"></a>148</span> great,
      and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage455D">D</a></span>things the most
      absurd?
    </p>
<p>
      You are quite right, he replied, in maintaining the general inferiority of
      the female sex: although many women are in many things superior to many
      men, yet on the whole what you say is true.
    </p>
<p>
      And if so, my friend, I said, there is no special faculty of
      administration in a state which a woman has because she is a woman, or
      which a man has by virtue of his sex, but the gifts of nature are alike
      diffused in both; all the pursuits of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage455E">E</a></span>men are the pursuits of women also,
      but in all of them a woman is inferior to a man.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Men and women are to be governed by the same laws and to have the same pursuits.</span>
      Then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on women?
    </p>
<p>
      That will never do.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage456A">456</a></span>
      One woman has a gift of healing, another not; one is a musician, and
      another has no music in her nature?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises, and another
      is unwarlike and hates gymnastics?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And one woman is a philosopher, and another is an enemy of philosophy; one
      has spirit, and another is without spirit?
    </p>
<p>
      That is also true.
    </p>
<p>
      Then one woman will have the temper of a guardian, and another not. Was
      not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of this
      sort?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Men and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian; they
      differ only in their comparative strength or weakness.
    </p>
<p>
      Obviously.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage456B">B</a></span>
      And those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the
      companions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom they
      resemble in capacity and in character?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?
    </p>
<p>
      They ought.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, as we were saying before, there is nothing unnatural <span class="pagenum"><a id="page149"></a>149</span> in assigning
      music and gymnastic to the wives of the guardians—to that point we
      come round again.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      The law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage456C">C</a></span>and therefore not
      an impossibility or mere aspiration; and the contrary practice, which
      prevails at present, is in reality a violation of nature.
    </p>
<p>
      That appears to be true.
    </p>
<p>
      We had to consider, first, whether our proposals were possible, and
      secondly whether they were the most beneficial?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And the possibility has been acknowledged?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      The very great benefit has next to be established?
    </p>
<p>
      Quite so.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> There are different degrees of goodness both in women and in men.</span>
      You will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian
      will make a woman a good guardian; for <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage456D">D</a></span>their original nature is the same?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      I should like to ask you a question.
    </p>
<p>
      What is it?
    </p>
<p>
      Would you say that all men are equal in excellence, or is one man better
      than another?
    </p>
<p>
      The latter.
    </p>
<p>
      And in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the
      guardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more perfect
      men, or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling?
    </p>
<p>
      What a ridiculous question!
    </p>
<p>
      You have answered me, I replied: Well, and may we not <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage456E">E</a></span>further say that our
      guardians are the best of our citizens?
    </p>
<p>
      By far the best.
    </p>
<p>
      And will not their wives be the best women?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, by far the best.
    </p>
<p>
      And can there be anything better for the interests of the State than that
      the men and women of a State should be as good as possible?
    </p>
<p>
      There can be nothing better.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage457A">457</a></span>
      And this is what the arts of music and gymnastic, when present in such
      manner as we have described, will accomplish? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page150"></a>150</span>
</p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Then we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest degree
      beneficial to the State?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      Then let the wives of our guardians strip, for their virtue will be their
      robe, and let them share in the toils of war and the defence of their
      country; only in the distribution of labours the lighter are to be
      assigned to the women, who are the weaker natures, but in other respects
      their duties are to be the same. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage457B">B</a></span>And as for the man who laughs at naked

      noble and the hurtful is the base.</em>
</p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      Here, then, is one difficulty in our law about women, which we may say
      that we have now escaped; the wave has not swallowed us up alive for
      enacting that the guardians of either sex should have all their pursuits
      in common; to the utility <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage457C">C</a></span>and also to the possibility of this arrangement
      the consistency of the argument with itself bears witness.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, that was a mighty wave which you have escaped.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The second and greater wave.</span>
      Yes, I said, but a greater is coming; you will not think much of this when
      you see the next.
    </p>
<p>
      Go on; let me see.
    </p>
<p>
      The law, I said, which is the sequel of this and of all that has preceded,
      is to the following effect,—‘that the wives of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage457D">D</a></span>our guardians are to
      be common, and their children are to be common, and no parent is to know
      his own child, nor any child his parent.’
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that is a much greater wave than the other; and the
      possibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more
      questionable.
    </p>
<p>
      I do not think, I said, that there can be any dispute about the very great
      utility of having wives and children in common; the possibility is quite
      another matter, and will be very much disputed. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page151"></a>151</span>
</p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage457E">E</a></span>
      I think that a good many doubts may be raised about both.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The utility and possibility of a community of wives and children.</span>
      You imply that the two questions must be combined, I replied. Now I meant
      that you should admit the utility; and in this way, as I thought, I should
      escape from one of them, and then there would remain only the possibility.
    </p>
<p>
      But that little attempt is detected, and therefore you will please to give
      a defence of both.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, I said, I submit to my fate. Yet grant me a little <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage458A">458</a></span>favour: let me
      feast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of feasting
      themselves when they are walking alone; for before they have discovered
      any means of effecting their wishes—that is a matter which never
      troubles them—they would rather not tire themselves by thinking
      about possibilities; but assuming that what they desire is already granted
      to them, they proceed with their plan, and delight in detailing what they
      mean to do when their wish has come true—that is a way which they
      have of not doing much good <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage458B">B</a></span>to a capacity which was never good for much.
      <span class="sidenote"> The utility to be considered first, the possibility afterwards.</span>Now I myself am beginning to lose heart, and I should like, with your
      permission, to pass over the question of possibility at present. Assuming
      therefore the possibility of the proposal, I shall now proceed to enquire
      how the rulers will carry out these arrangements, and I shall demonstrate
      that our plan, if executed, will be of the greatest benefit to the State
      and to the guardians. First of all, then, if you have no objection, I will
      endeavour with your help to consider the advantages of the measure; and
      hereafter the question of possibility.
    </p>
<p>
      I have no objection; proceed.
    </p>
<p>
      First, I think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage458C">C</a></span>be worthy
      of the name which they bear, there must be willingness to obey in the one
      and the power of command in the other; the guardians must themselves obey
      the laws, and they must also imitate the spirit of them in any details
      which are entrusted to their care.
    </p>
<p>
      That is right, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The legislator will select guardians male and female, who will meet at common meals and exercises, and will be drawn to one another by an irresistible necessity.</span>
      You, I said, who are their legislator, having selected the men, will now
      select the women and give them to them;—they must be as far as
      possible of like natures with them; and they must live in common houses
      and meet at common meals. None of them will have anything specially his or
      her own; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page152"></a>152</span> <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage458D">D</a></span>they will be together, and will be brought up together, and will
      associate at gymnastic exercises. And so they will be drawn by a necessity
      of their natures to have intercourse with each other—necessity is
      not too strong a word, I think?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said;—necessity, not geometrical, but another sort of
      necessity which lovers know, and which is far more convincing and
      constraining to the mass of mankind.
    </p>
<p>
      True, I said; and this, Glaucon, like all the rest, must proceed after an
      orderly fashion; in a city of the blessed, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage458E">E</a></span>licentiousness is an unholy
      thing which the rulers will forbid.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, and it ought not to be permitted.
    </p>
<p>
      Then clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the
      highest degree, and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage459A">459</a></span>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The breeding of human beings, as of animals, to be from the best and from those who are of a ripe age.</span>
      And how can marriages be made most beneficial?—that is a question
      which I put to you, because I see in your house dogs for hunting, and of
      the nobler sort of birds not a few. Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have
      you ever attended to their pairing and breeding?
    </p>
<p>
      In what particulars?
    </p>
<p>
      Why, in the first place, although they are all of a good sort, are not
      some better than others?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And do you breed from them all indifferently, or do you take care to breed
      from the best only?
    </p>
<p>
      From the best.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage459B">B</a></span>
      And do you take the oldest or the youngest, or only those of ripe age?
    </p>
<p>
      I choose only those of ripe age.
    </p>
<p>
      And if care was not taken in the breeding, your dogs and birds would
      greatly deteriorate?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And the same of horses and animals in general?
    </p>
<p>
      Undoubtedly.
    </p>
<p>
      Good heavens! my dear friend, I said, what consummate skill will our
      rulers need if the same principle holds of the human species!
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage459C">C</a></span>
      Certainly, the same principle holds; but why does this involve any
      particular skill? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page153"></a>153</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Useful lies ‘very honest knaveries.’</span>
      Because, I said, our rulers will often have to practise upon the body
      corporate with medicines. Now you know that when patients do not require
      medicines, but have only to be put under a regimen, the inferior sort of
      practitioner is deemed to be good enough; but when medicine has to be
      given, then the doctor should be more of a man.
    </p>
<p>
      That is quite true, he said; but to what are you alluding?
    </p>
<p>
      I mean, I replied, that our rulers will find a considerable dose of
      falsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects: <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage459D">D</a></span>we were
      saying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines might be of
      advantage.
    </p>
<p>
      And we were very right.
    </p>
<p>
      And this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the
      regulations of marriages and births.
    </p>
<p>
      How so?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Arrangements for the improvement of the breed;</span>
      Why, I said, the principle has been already laid down that the best of
      either sex should be united with the best as often, and the inferior with
      the inferior, as seldom as possible; and that they should rear the
      offspring of the one sort of union, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage459E">E</a></span>but not of the other, if the flock is
      to be maintained in first-rate condition. Now these goings on must be a
      secret which the rulers only know, or there will be a further danger of
      our herd, as the guardians may be termed, breaking out into rebellion.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> and for the regulation of population.</span>
      Had we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring
      together the brides and bridegrooms, and sacrifices <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage460A">460</a></span>will be offered and
      suitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets: the number of weddings is a
      matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers, whose aim will
      be to preserve the average of population? There are many other things
      which they will have to consider, such as the effects of wars and diseases
      and any similar agencies, in order as far as this is possible to prevent
      the State from becoming either too large or too small.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Pairing by lot.</span>
      We shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less worthy
      may draw on each occasion of our bringing them together, and then they
      will accuse their own ill-luck and not the rulers. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page154"></a>154</span>
</p>
<p>
      To be sure, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage460B">B</a></span><span class="sidenote"> The brave deserve the fair.</span>
      And I think that our braver and better youth, besides their other honours
      and rewards, might have greater facilities of intercourse with women given
      them; their bravery will be a reason, and such fathers ought to have as
      many sons as possible.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And the proper officers, whether male or female or both, for offices are
      to be held by women as well as by men—
    </p>
<p>
      Yes—
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage460C">C</a></span><span class="sidenote"> What is to be done with the children?</span>
      The proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to the pen
      or fold, and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who dwell in
      a separate quarter; but the offspring of the inferior, or of the better
      when they chance to be deformed, will be put away in some mysterious,
      unknown place, as they should be.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to be
      kept pure.
    </p>
<p>
      They will provide for their nurture, and will bring the mothers to the
      fold when they are full of milk, taking the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage460D">D</a></span>greatest possible care that no
      mother recognises her own child; and other wet-nurses may be engaged if
      more are required. Care will also be taken that the process of suckling
      shall not be protracted too long; and the mothers will have no getting up
      at night or other trouble, but will hand over all this sort of thing to
      the nurses and attendants.
    </p>
<p>
      You suppose the wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time of it when
      they are having children.
    </p>
<p>
      Why, said I, and so they ought. Let us, however, proceed with our scheme.
      We were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage460E">E</a></span>
      And what is the prime of life? May it not be defined as a period of about
      twenty years in a woman’s life, and thirty in a man’s?
    </p>
<p>
      Which years do you mean to include?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> A woman to bear children from twenty to forty; a man to beget them from twenty-five to fifty-five.</span>
      A woman, I said, at twenty years of age may begin to bear children to the
      State, and continue to bear them until forty; a man may begin at
      five-and-twenty, when he has passed the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page155"></a>155</span> point at which the pulse of life
      beats quickest, and continue to beget children until he be fifty-five.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage461A">461</a></span>
      Certainly, he said, both in men and women those years are the prime of
      physical as well as of intellectual vigour.
    </p>
<p>
      Any one above or below the prescribed ages who takes part in the public
      hymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing; the
      child of which he is the father, if it steals into life, will have been
      conceived under auspices very unlike the sacrifices and prayers, which at
      each hymeneal priestesses and priest and the whole city will offer, that
      the new generation may be better and more useful than their <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage461B">B</a></span>good and
      useful parents, whereas his child will be the offspring of darkness and
      strange lust.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And the same law will apply to any one of those within the prescribed age
      who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without the
      sanction of the rulers; for we shall say that he is raising up a bastard
      to the State, uncertified and unconsecrated.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> After the
prescribed age has been passed, more licence is allowed: but all who
were born after certain hymeneal festivals at which their parents or
grandparents came together must be kept separate.</span>
      This applies, however, only to those who are within the specified age:
      after that we allow them to range at will, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage461C">C</a></span>except that a man may not marry
      his daughter or his daughter’s daughter, or his mother or his mother’s
      mother; and women, on the other hand, are prohibited from marrying their
      sons or fathers, or son’s son or father’s father, and so on in either
      direction. And we grant all this, accompanying the permission with strict
      orders to prevent any embryo which may come into being from seeing the
      light; and if any force a way to the birth, the parents must understand
      that the offspring of such an union cannot be maintained, and arrange
      accordingly.
    </p>
<p>
      That also, he said, is a reasonable proposition. But how <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage461D">D</a></span>will they know
      who are fathers and daughters, and so on?
    </p>
<p>
      They will never know. The way will be this:—dating from the day of
      the hymeneal, the bridegroom who was then married will call all the male
      children who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards his sons,
      and the female children his daughters, and they will call him father, and
      he will call their children his grandchildren, and they <span class="pagenum"><a id="page156"></a>156</span> will call the
      elder generation grandfathers and grandmothers. All who were begotten at
      the time when their fathers and mothers came together will be called their
      brothers and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage461E">E</a></span>sisters, and these, as I was saying, will be forbidden to
      inter-marry. This, however, is not to be understood as an absolute
      prohibition of the marriage of brothers and sisters; if the lot favours
      them, and they receive the sanction of the Pythian oracle, the law will
      allow them.
    </p>
<p>
      Quite right, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Such is the scheme, Glaucon, according to which the guardians of our State
      are to have their wives and families in common. And now you would have the
      argument show that this community is consistent with the rest of our
      polity, and also that nothing can be better—would you not?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage462A">462</a></span>
      Yes, certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Shall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought to
      be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the organization
      of a State,—what is the greatest good, and what is the greatest
      evil, and then consider whether our previous description has the stamp of
      the good or of the evil?
    </p>
<p>
      By all means.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The greatest good of States, unity; the greatest evil, discord. The one the result of public, the other of private feelings.</span>
      Can there be any greater evil than discord and distraction <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage462B">B</a></span>and plurality
      where unity ought to reign? or any greater good than the bond of unity?
    </p>
<p>
      There cannot.
    </p>
<p>
      And there is unity where there is community of pleasures and pains—where
      all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions of joy and
      sorrow?
    </p>
<p>
      No doubt.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes; and where there is no common but only private feeling a State is
      disorganized—when you have one half of the world triumphing and the
      other plunged in grief at <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage462C">C</a></span>the same events happening to the city or the
      citizens?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Such differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use of the
      terms ‘mine’ and ‘not mine,’ ‘his’ and ‘not his.’
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly so.
    </p>
<p>
      And is not that the best-ordered State in which the greatest <span class="pagenum"><a id="page157"></a>157</span> number of
      persons apply the terms ‘mine’ and ‘not mine’ in the same way to the same
      thing?
    </p>
<p>
      Quite true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The State like a living being which feels altogether when hurt in any part.</span>
      Or that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the
      individual—as in the body, when but a finger of one of us is hurt,
      the whole frame, drawn towards the soul as a centre and forming one
      kingdom under the ruling power <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage462D">D</a></span>therein, feels the hurt and sympathizes all
      together with the part affected, and we say that the man has a pain in his
      finger; and the same expression is used about any other part of the body,
      which has a sensation of pain at suffering or of pleasure at the
      alleviation of suffering.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he replied; and I agree with you that in the best-ordered State
      there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you describe.
    </p>
<p>
      Then when any one of the citizens experiences any good <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage462E">E</a></span>or evil, the whole
      State will make his case their own, and will either rejoice or sorrow with
      him?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that is what will happen in a well-ordered State.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> How different are the terms which are applied to the rulers in other States and in our own!</span>
      It will now be time, I said, for us to return to our State and see whether
      this or some other form is most in accordance with these fundamental
      principles.
    </p>
<p>
      Very good.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage463A">463</a></span>
      Our State like every other has rulers and subjects?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      All of whom will call one another citizens?
    </p>
<p>
      Of course.
    </p>
<p>
      But is there not another name which people give to their rulers in other
      States?
    </p>
<p>
      Generally they call them masters, but in democratic States they simply
      call them rulers.
    </p>
<p>
      And in our State what other name besides that of citizens do the people
      give the rulers?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage463B">B</a></span>
      They are called saviours and helpers, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And what do the rulers call the people?
    </p>
<p>
      Their maintainers and foster-fathers.
    </p>
<p>
      And what do they call them in other States?
    </p>
<p>
      Slaves.
    </p>
<p>
      And what do the rulers call one another in other States? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page158"></a>158</span>
</p>
<p>
      Fellow-rulers.
    </p>
<p>
      And what in ours?
    </p>
<p>
      Fellow-guardians.
    </p>
<p>
      Did you ever know an example in any other State of a ruler who would speak
      of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not being his
      friend?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, very often.
    </p>
<p>
      And the friend he regards and describes as one in whom <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage463C">C</a></span>he has an interest,
      and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p>
      But would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as a
      stranger?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly he would not; for every one whom they meet will be regarded by
      them either as a brother or sister, or father or mother, or son or
      daughter, or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected with
      him.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The State one family.</span>
      Capital, I said; but let me ask you once more: Shall they <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage463D">D</a></span>be a family in
      name only; or shall they in all their actions be true to the name? For
      example, in the use of the word ‘father,’ would the care of a father be
      implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to him which the
      law commands; and is the violator of these duties to be regarded as an
      impious and unrighteous person who is not likely to receive much good
      either at the hands of God or of man? Are these to be or not to be the
      strains which the children will hear repeated in their ears by all the
      citizens about those who are intimated to them to be their parents and the
      rest of their kinsfolk?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage463E">E</a></span><span class="sidenote"> Using the same
terms, they will have the same modes of thinking and acting, and this is
 to be attributed mainly to the community of women and children.</span>
      These, he said, and none other; for what can be more ridiculous than for
      them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and not to act
      in the spirit of them?
    </p>
<p>
      Then in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more often
      heard than in any other. As I was describing before, when any one is well
      or ill, the universal word will be ‘with me it is well’ or ‘it is ill.’
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage464A">464</a></span>
      Most true.
    </p>
<p>
      And agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking, were we not saying
      that they will have their pleasures and pains in common? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page159"></a>159</span>
</p>
<p>
      Yes, and so they will.
    </p>
<p>
      And they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will
      alike call ‘my own,’ and having this common interest they will have a
      common feeling of pleasure and pain?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, far more so than in other States.
    </p>
<p>
      And the reason of this, over and above the general constitution of the
      State, will be that the guardians will have a community of women and
      children?
    </p>
<p>
      That will be the chief reason.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage464B">B</a></span>
      And this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good, as was
      implied in our own comparison of a well-ordered State to the relation of
      the body and the members, when affected by pleasure or pain?
    </p>
<p>
      That we acknowledged, and very rightly.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly the
      source of the greatest good to the State?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And this agrees with the other principle which we were affirming,—that
      the guardians were not to have houses or <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage464C">C</a></span>lands or any other property;
      their pay was to be their food, which they were to receive from the other
      citizens, and they were to have no private expenses; for we intended them
      to preserve their true character of guardians.
    </p>
<p>
      Right, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> There will be no private interests among them, and therefore no lawsuits or trials for assault or violence to elders.</span>
      Both the community of property and the community of families, as I am
      saying, tend to make them more truly guardians; they will not tear the
      city in pieces by differing about ‘mine’ and ‘not mine;’ each man dragging
      any <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage464D">D</a></span>acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his own, where
      he has a separate wife and children and private pleasures and pains; but
      all will be affected as far as may be by the same pleasures and pains
      because they are all of one opinion about what is near and dear to them,
      and therefore they all tend towards a common end.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their own,
      suits and complaints will have no existence <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage464E">E</a></span>among them; they will be
      delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children or relations
      are the occasion. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page160"></a>160</span>
</p>
<p>
      Of course they will.
    </p>
<p>
      Neither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur among
      them. For that equals should defend themselves against equals we shall
      maintain to be honourable and right; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage465A">465</a></span>we shall make the protection of the
      person a matter of necessity.
    </p>
<p>
      That is good, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes; and there is a further good in the law; viz. that if a man has a
      quarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there, and
      not proceed to more dangerous lengths.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      To the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising the
      younger.
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      Nor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do any other
      violence to an elder, unless the magistrates command him; nor will he
      slight him in any way. For there are two guardians, shame and fear, mighty
      to prevent him: shame, which makes men refrain from laying hands on <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage465B">B</a></span>those
      who are to them in the relation of parents; fear, that the injured one
      will be succoured by the others who are his brothers, sons, fathers.
    </p>
<p>
      That is true, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace with
      one another?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, there will be no want of peace.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> From how many other evils will our citizens be delivered!</span>
      And as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will be no
      danger of the rest of the city being divided either against them or
      against one another.
    </p>
<p>
      None whatever.
    </p>
<p>
      I hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage465C">C</a></span> which they will be
      rid, for they are beneath notice: such, for example, as the flattery of
      the rich by the poor, and all the pains and pangs which men experience in
      bringing up a family, and in finding money to buy necessaries for their
      household, borrowing and then repudiating, getting how they can, and
      giving the money into the hands of women and slaves to keep—the many
      evils of so many kinds which people suffer in this way are mean enough and
      obvious enough, and not worth speaking of. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page161"></a>161</span>
</p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage465D">D</a></span>
      Yes, he said, a man has no need of eyes in order to perceive that.
    </p>
<p>
      And from all these evils they will be delivered, and their life will be
      blessed as the life of Olympic victors and yet more blessed.
    </p>
<p>
      How so?
    </p>
<p>
      The Olympic victor, I said, is deemed happy in receiving a part only of
      the blessedness which is secured to our citizens, who have won a more
      glorious victory and have a more complete maintenance at the public cost.
      For the victory which they have won is the salvation of the whole State;
      and the crown with which they and their children are crowned is the
      fulness of all that life needs; they receive <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage465E">E</a></span>rewards from the hands of
      their country while living, and after death have an honourable burial.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, and glorious rewards they are.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Answer to the charge of Adeimantus that we made our citizens unhappy for their own good.</span>
      Do you remember, I said, how in the course of the previous <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage466A">466</a></span>discussion<a href="#Footnotebook56" id="FnAnchorbook56" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">6</span></a> some
      one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians unhappy—they
      had nothing and might have possessed all things—to whom we replied
      that, if an occasion offered, we might perhaps hereafter consider this
      question, but that, as at present advised, we would make our guardians
      truly guardians, and that we were fashioning the State with a view to the
      greatest happiness, not of any particular class, but of the whole?
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook56"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook56" class="pginternal">6</a></span> Pages <a href="#stpage419E" class="pginternal">419</a>, <a href="#stpage420A" class="pginternal">420</a> ff.</p></div>
<p>
      Yes, I remember.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Their life not to be compared with that of citizens in ordinary States.</span>
      And what do you say, now that the life of our protectors is made out to be
      far better and nobler than that of Olympic <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage466B">B</a></span>victors—is the life of
      shoemakers, or any other artisans, or of husbandmen, to be compared with
      it?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> He who seeks to be more than a guardian is naught.</span>
      At the same time I ought here to repeat what I have said elsewhere, that
      if any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner that he
      will cease to be a guardian, and is not content with this safe and
      harmonious life, which, in our judgment, is of all lives the best, but
      infatuated by some youthful conceit of happiness which gets up into his
      head <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage466C">C</a></span>shall seek to appropriate the whole state to himself, then he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page162"></a>162</span> will
      have to learn how wisely Hesiod spoke, when he said, ‘half is more than
      the whole.’
    </p>
<p>
      If he were to consult me, I should say to him: Stay where you are, when
      you have the offer of such a life.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The common way of life includes common education, common children, common services and duties of men and women.</span>
      You agree then, I said, that men and women are to have a common way of
      life such as we have described—common education, common children;
      and they are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding in the
      city or going out to war; they are to keep watch together, and to hunt
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage466D">D</a></span>together like dogs; and always and in all things, as far as they are able,
      women are to share with the men? And in so doing they will do what is
      best, and will not violate, but preserve the natural relation of the
      sexes.
    </p>
<p>
      I agree with you, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      The enquiry, I said, has yet to be made, whether such a community be found
      possible—as among other animals, so also among men—and if
      possible, in what way possible?
    </p>
<p>
      You have anticipated the question which I was about to suggest.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage466E">E</a></span>
      There is no difficulty, I said, in seeing how war will be carried on by
      them.
    </p>
<p>
      How?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The children to accompany their parents on military expeditions;</span>
      Why, of course they will go on expeditions together; and will take with
      them any of their children who are strong enough, that, after the manner
      of the artisan’s child, they may look on at the work which they will have
      to do when they are grown up; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage467A">467</a></span>and besides looking on they will have to
      help and be of use in war, and to wait upon their fathers and mothers. Did
      you never observe in the arts how the potters’ boys look on and help, long
      before they touch the wheel?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I have.
    </p>
<p>
      And shall potters be more careful in educating their children and in
      giving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties than our
      guardians will be?
    </p>
<p>
      The idea is ridiculous, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      There is also the effect on the parents, with whom, as with <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage467B">B</a></span>other animals,
      the presence of their young ones will be the greatest incentive to valour.
    </p>
<p>
      That is quite true, Socrates; and yet if they are defeated, which may
      often happen in war, how great the danger is! <span class="pagenum"><a id="page163"></a>163</span> the children will be lost as
      well as their parents, and the State will never recover.
    </p>
<p>
      True, I said; but would you never allow them to run any risk?
    </p>
<p>
      I am far from saying that.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some
      occasion when, if they escape disaster, they will be the better for it?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage467C">C</a></span><span class="sidenote"> but care must be taken that they do not run any serious risk.</span>
      Whether the future soldiers do or do not see war in the days of their
      youth is a very important matter, for the sake of which some risk may
      fairly be incurred.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, very important.
    </p>
<p>
      This then must be our first step,—to make our children spectators of
      war; but we must also contrive that they shall be secured against danger;
      then all will be well.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      Their parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of war, but to
      know, as far as human foresight can, what <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage467D">D</a></span>expeditions are safe and what
      dangerous?
    </p>
<p>
      That may be assumed.
    </p>
<p>
      And they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about the
      dangerous ones?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who
      will be their leaders and teachers?
    </p>
<p>
      Very properly.
    </p>
<p>
      Still, the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen; there is a good deal
      of chance about them?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      Then against such chances the children must be at once furnished with
      wings, in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage467E">E</a></span>
      What do you mean? he said.
    </p>
<p>
      I mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest youth, and when
      they have learnt to ride, take them on horseback to see war: the horses
      must not be spirited and warlike, but the most tractable and yet the
      swiftest that can be had. In this way they will get an excellent view of
      what is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage468A">468</a></span>hereafter to be their own business; and if there is danger they
      have only to follow their elder leaders and escape. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page164"></a>164</span>
</p>
<p>
      I believe that you are right, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The coward is to be degraded into a lower rank.</span>
      Next, as to war; what are to be the relations of your soldiers to one
      another and to their enemies? I should be inclined to propose that the
      soldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms, or is guilty of any
      other act of cowardice, should be degraded into the rank of a husbandman
      or artisan. What do you think?
    </p>
<p>
      By all means, I should say.
    </p>
<p>
      And he who allows himself to be taken prisoner may as well be made a
      present of to his enemies; he is their lawful prey, and let them do what
      they like with him.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage468B">B</a></span>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The hero to receive honour from his comrades and favour from his beloved,</span>
      But the hero who has distinguished himself, what shall be done to him? In
      the first place, he shall receive honour in the army from his youthful
      comrades; every one of them in succession shall crown him. What do you
      say?
    </p>
<p>
      I approve.
    </p>
<p>
      And what do you say to his receiving the right hand of fellowship?
    </p>
<p>
      To that too, I agree.
    </p>
<p>
      But you will hardly agree to my next proposal.
    </p>
<p>
      What is your proposal?
    </p>
<p>
      That he should kiss and be kissed by them.
    </p>
<p>
      Most certainly, and I should be disposed to go further, and say: <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage468C">C</a></span>Let no
      one whom he has a mind to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while the
      expedition lasts. So that if there be a lover in the army, whether his
      love be youth or maiden, he may be more eager to win the prize of valour.
    </p>
<p>
      Capital, I said. That the brave man is to have more wives than others has
      been already determined: and he is to have first choices in such matters
      more than others, in order that he may have as many children as possible?
    </p>
<p>
      Agreed.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> and to have precedence, and a larger share of meats and drinks;</span>
      Again, there is another manner in which, according to <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage468D">D</a></span>Homer, brave youths
      should be honoured; for he tells how Ajax<a href="#Footnotebook57" id="FnAnchorbook57" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">7</span></a>, after he had distinguished
      himself in battle, was rewarded with long chines, which seems to be a
      compliment appropriate to a hero in the flower of his age, being not only
      a tribute of honour but also a very strengthening thing. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page165"></a>165</span>
</p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook57"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook57" class="pginternal">7</a></span> Iliad, vii. 321.</p></div>
<p>
      Most true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then in this, I said, Homer shall be our teacher; and we too, at
      sacrifices and on the like occasions, will honour the brave according to
      the measure of their valour, whether men or women, with hymns and those
      other distinctions which we were mentioning; also with
    </p>
<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">

<p>
      That, he replied, is excellent.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said; and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say, in
      the first place, that he is of the golden race?
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> also to be worshipped after death.</span>

<p>
      Yes; and we accept his authority.
    </p>
<p>
      We must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine and
      heroic personages, and what is to be their special distinction; and we
      must do as he bids?
    </p>
<p>
      By all means.
    </p>
<p>
      And in ages to come we will reverence them and kneel <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage469B">B</a></span>before their
      sepulchres as at the graves of heroes. And not only they but any who are
      deemed pre-eminently good, whether they die from age, or in any other way,
      shall be admitted to the same honours.
    </p>
<p>
      That is very right, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Behaviour to enemies.</span>
      Next, how shall our soldiers treat their enemies? What about this?
    </p>
<p>
      In what respect do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      First of all, in regard to slavery? Do you think it right that Hellenes
      should enslave Hellenic States, or allow others to enslave them, if they
      can help? Should not their custom be to spare them, considering the danger
      which there is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage469C">C</a></span>that the whole race may one day fall under the yoke of the
      barbarians?
    </p>
<p>
      To spare them is infinitely better. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page166"></a>166</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> No Hellene shall be made a slave.</span>
      Then no Hellene should be owned by them as a slave; that is a rule which
      they will observe and advise the other Hellenes to observe.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said; they will in this way be united against the barbarians
      and will keep their hands off one another.
    </p>
<p>
      Next as to the slain; ought the conquerors, I said, to take anything but
      their armour? Does not the practice of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage469D">D</a></span>despoiling an enemy afford an
      excuse for not facing the battle? Cowards skulk about the dead, pretending
      that they are fulfilling a duty, and many an army before now has been lost
      from this love of plunder.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Those who fall in battle are not to be despoiled.</span>
      And is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse, and also a
      degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the dead body
      when the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting gear behind
      him,—is not this <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage469E">E</a></span>rather like a dog who cannot get at his assailant,
      quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead?
    </p>
<p>
      Very like a dog, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he replied, we most certainly must.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The arms of Hellenes are not to be offered at temples;</span>
      Neither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage470A">470</a></span>least of all
      the arms of Hellenes, if we care to maintain good feeling with other
      Hellenes; and, indeed, we have reason to fear that the offering of spoils
      taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the god himself?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      Again, as to the devastation of Hellenic territory or the burning of
      houses, what is to be the practice?
    </p>
<p>
      May I have the pleasure, he said, of hearing your opinion?
    </p>
<p>
      Both should be forbidden, in my judgment; I would take the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage470B">B</a></span>annual produce
      and no more. Shall I tell you why?
    </p>
<p>
      Pray do.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> nor Hellenic territory devastated.</span>
      Why, you see, there is a difference in the names ‘discord’ and ‘war,’ and
      I imagine that there is also a difference in their natures; the one is
      expressive of what is internal and domestic, the other of what is external
      and foreign; and the first of the two is termed discord, and only the
      second, war. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page167"></a>167</span>
</p>
<p>
      That is a very proper distinction, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage470C">C</a></span>
      And may I not observe with equal propriety that the Hellenic race is all
      united together by ties of blood and friendship, and alien and strange to
      the barbarians?
    </p>
<p>
      Very good, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And therefore when Hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians with
      Hellenes, they will be described by us as being at war when they fight,
      and by nature enemies, and this kind of antagonism should be called war;
      <span class="sidenote"> Hellenic warfare is only a kind of discord not intended to be lasting.</span>but when Hellenes fight with one another we shall say that Hellas is then
      in a state of disorder and discord, they being by nature friends; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage470D">D</a></span>and such
      enmity is to be called discord.
    </p>
<p>
      I agree.
    </p>
<p>
      Consider then, I said, when that which we have acknowledged to be discord
      occurs, and a city is divided, if both parties destroy the lands and burn
      the houses of one another, how wicked does the strife appear! No true
      lover of his country would bring himself to tear in pieces his own nurse
      and mother: There might be reason in the conqueror depriving the conquered
      of their harvest, but still they would <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage470E">E</a></span>have the idea of peace in their
      hearts and would not mean to go on fighting for ever.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that is a better temper than the other.
    </p>
<p>
      And will not the city, which you are founding, be an Hellenic city?
    </p>
<p>
      It ought to be, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Then will not the citizens be good and civilized?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, very civilized.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The lover of his own city will also be a lover of Hellas.</span>
      And will they not be lovers of Hellas, and think of Hellas as their own
      land, and share in the common temples?
    </p>
<p>
      Most certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And any difference which arises among them will be <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage471A">471</a></span>regarded by them as
      discord only—a quarrel among friends, which is not to be called a
      war?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      Then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      They will use friendly correction, but will not enslave or destroy their
      opponents; they will be correctors, not enemies? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page168"></a>168</span>
</p>
<p>
      Just so.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Hellenes should deal mildly with Hellenes; and with barbarians as Hellenes now deal with one another.</span>
      And as they are Hellenes themselves they will not devastate Hellas, nor
      will they burn houses, nor ever suppose that the whole population of a
      city—men, women, and children—are equally their enemies, for
      they know that the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons and
      that the many are their friends. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage471B">B</a></span>And for all these reasons they will be
      unwilling to waste their lands and rase their houses; their enmity to them
      will only last until the many innocent sufferers have compelled the guilty
      few to give satisfaction?
    </p>
<p>
      I agree, he said, that our citizens should thus deal with their Hellenic
      enemies; and with barbarians as the Hellenes now deal with one another.
    </p>
<p>
      Then let us enact this law also for our guardians:—that they are
      neither to devastate the lands of Hellenes nor to <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage471C">C</a></span>burn their houses.
    </p>
<p>
      Agreed; and we may agree also in thinking that these, like all our
      previous enactments, are very good.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The complaint of Glaucon respecting the hesitation of Socrates.</span>
      But still I must say, Socrates, that if you are allowed to go on in this
      way you will entirely forget the other question which at the commencement
      of this discussion you thrust aside:—Is such an order of things
      possible, and how, if at all? For I am quite ready to acknowledge that the
      plan which you propose, if only feasible, would do all sorts of good to
      the State. I will add, what you have omitted, that your <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage471D">D</a></span>citizens will be
      the bravest of warriors, and will never leave their ranks, for they will
      all know one another, and each will call the other father, brother, son;
      and if you suppose the women to join their armies, whether in the same
      rank or in the rear, either as a terror to the enemy, or as auxiliaries in
      case of need, I know that they will then be absolutely invincible; and
      there are many domestic advantages which might also be mentioned and which
      I also fully acknowledge: <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage471E">E</a></span>but, as I admit all these advantages and as many
      more as you please, if only this State of yours were to come into
      existence, we need say no more about them; assuming then the existence of
      the State, let us now turn to the question of possibility and ways and
      means—the rest may be left. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page169"></a>169</span>

<p>
      The more appeals of this sort which you make, he said, the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage472B">B</a></span>more determined
      are we that you shall tell us how such a State is possible: speak out and
      at once.
    </p>
<p>
      Let me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the search
      after justice and injustice.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he replied; but what of that?
    </p>
<p>
      I was only going to ask whether, if we have discovered them, we are to
      require that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice; or
      may we be satisfied with an approximation, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage472C">C</a></span>and the attainment in him of a
      higher degree of justice than is to be found in other men?
    </p>
<p>
      The approximation will be enough.
    </p>
<p>
      We were enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the
      character of the perfectly just, and into injustice and the perfectly
      unjust, that we might have an ideal. <span class="sidenote"> (1) The ideal is a standard only which can never be perfectly realized;</span>We were to look at these in order
      that we might judge of our own happiness and unhappiness according to the
      standard <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage472D">D</a></span>which they exhibited and the degree in which we resembled them,
      but not with any view of showing that they could exist in fact.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Would a painter be any the worse because, after having delineated with
      consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man, he was unable to
      show that any such man could ever have existed?
    </p>
<p>
      He would be none the worse.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage472E">E</a></span>
      Well, and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect State?
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> (2) but is none the worse for this.</span>
      And is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page170"></a>170</span> prove the
      possibility of a city being ordered in the manner described?
    </p>
<p>
      Surely not, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      That is the truth, I said. But if, at your request, I am to try and show
      how and under what conditions the possibility is highest, I must ask you,
      having this in view, to repeat your former admissions.
    </p>
<p>
      What admissions?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage473A">473</a></span>
      I want to know whether ideals are ever fully realized in language? Does
      not the word express more than the fact, and must not the actual, whatever
      a man may think, always, in the nature of things, fall short of the truth?
      What do you say?
    </p>
<p>
      I agree.
    </p>
<p>
      Then you must not insist on my proving that the actual State will in every
      respect coincide with the ideal: if we are only able to discover how a
      city may be governed nearly as we proposed, you will admit that we have
      discovered the possibility which you demand; and will be contented. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage473B">B</a></span>I am
      sure that I should be contented—will not you?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I will.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> (3) Although the ideal cannot be realized, one or two changes, or rather a single change, might revolutionize a State.</span>
      Let me next endeavour to show what is that fault in States which is the
      cause of their present maladministration, and what is the least change
      which will enable a State to pass into the truer form; and let the change,
      if possible, be of one thing only, or, if not, of two; at any rate, let
      the changes be as few and slight as possible.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage473C">C</a></span>
      Certainly, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      I think, I said, that there might be a reform of the State if only one
      change were made, which is not a slight or easy though still a possible
      one.
    </p>
<p>
      What is it? he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Socrates goes forth to meet the wave.</span>
      Now then, I said, I go to meet that which I liken to the greatest of the
      waves; yet shall the word be spoken, even though the wave break and drown
      me in laughter and dishonour; and do you mark my words.
    </p>
<p>
      Proceed.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> ‘Cities will never cease from ill until they are governed by philosophers.’</span>
      I said: <em>Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this
      world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage473D">D</a></span>political greatness and
      wisdom meet in one, and those</em> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page171"></a>171</span> <em>commoner natures who pursue either to the
      exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities will never
      have rest from their evils,—nor the human race, as I believe,—and
      then only will this <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage473E">E</a></span>our State have a possibility of life and behold the
      light of day.</em> Such was the thought, my dear Glaucon, which I would fain
      have uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant; for to be convinced
      that in no other State can there be happiness private or public is indeed
      a hard thing.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> What will the world say to this?</span>
      Socrates, what do you mean? I would have you consider that the word which
      you have uttered is one at which numerous persons, and very respectable
      persons too, in <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage474A">474</a></span>a figure pulling off their coats all in a moment, and
      seizing any weapon that comes to hand, will run at you might and main,
      before you know where you are, intending to do heaven knows what; and if
      you don’t prepare an answer, and put yourself in motion, you will be
      ‘pared by their fine wits,’ and no mistake.
    </p>
<p>
      You got me into the scrape, I said.
    </p>
<p>
      And I was quite right; however, I will do all I can to get you out of it;
      but I can only give you good-will and good advice, and, perhaps, I may be
      able to fit answers to your questions better than another—that is
      all. And now, having <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage474B">B</a></span>such an auxiliary, you must do your best to show the
      unbelievers that you are right.
    </p>
<p>
      I ought to try, I said, since you offer me such invaluable assistance. And
      I think that, if there is to be a chance of our escaping, <span class="sidenote"> But who is a philosopher?</span>we must explain
      to them whom we mean when we say that philosophers are to rule in the
      State; then we shall be able to defend ourselves: There will be discovered
      to be some natures who ought to study philosophy and to be <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage474C">C</a></span>leaders in the
      State; and others who are not born to be philosophers, and are meant to be
      followers rather than leaders.
    </p>
<p>
      Then now for a definition, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Follow me, I said, and I hope that I may in some way or other be able to
      give you a satisfactory explanation.
    </p>
<p>
      Proceed.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Parallel of the lover.</span>
      I dare say that you remember, and therefore I need not remind you, that a
      lover, if he is worthy of the name, ought to show his love, not to some
      one part of that which he loves, but to the whole. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page172"></a>172</span>
</p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage474D">D</a></span>
      I really do not understand, and therefore beg of you to assist my memory.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The lover of the fair loves them all;</span>
      Another person, I said, might fairly reply as you do; but a man of
      pleasure like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower of
      youth do somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a lover’s breast, and
      are thought by him to be worthy of his affectionate regards. Is not this a
      way which you have with the fair: one has a snub nose, and you praise his
      charming face; the hook-nose of another has, you say, a royal look; while
      he who is neither snub nor hooked has <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage474E">E</a></span>the grace of regularity: the dark
      visage is manly, the fair are children of the gods; and as to the sweet
      ‘honey pale,’ as they are called, what is the very name but the invention
      of a lover who talks in diminutives, and is not averse to paleness if
      appearing on the cheek of youth? In a word, there is no <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage475A">475</a></span>excuse which you
      will not make, and nothing which you will not say, in order not to lose a
      single flower that blooms in the spring-time of youth.
    </p>
<p>
      If you make me an authority in matters of love, for the sake of the
      argument, I assent.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> the lover of wines all wines;</span>
      And what do you say of lovers of wine? Do you not see them doing the same?
      They are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine.
    </p>
<p>
      Very good.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> the lover of honour all honour;</span>
      And the same is true of ambitious men; if they cannot command an army,
      they are willing to command a file; and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage475B">B</a></span>if they cannot be honoured by
      really great and important persons, they are glad to be honoured by lesser
      and meaner people,—but honour of some kind they must have.
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p>
      Once more let me ask: Does he who desires any class of goods, desire the
      whole class or a part only?
    </p>
<p>
      The whole.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> the philosopher, or lover of wisdom, all knowledge.</span>
      And may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover, not of a part of
      wisdom only, but of the whole?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, of the whole.
    </p>
<p>
      And he who dislikes learning, especially in youth, when <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage475C">C</a></span>he has no power of
      judging what is good and what is not, such an one we maintain not to be a
      philosopher or a lover of knowledge, just as he who refuses his food is
      not hungry, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page173"></a>173</span> and may be said to have a bad appetite and not a good one?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Whereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is curious
      to learn and is never satisfied, may be justly termed a philosopher? Am I
      not right?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage475D">D</a></span><span class="sidenote"> Under knowledge,
however, are not to be included sights and sounds, or under the lovers
of knowledge, musical amateurs and the like.</span>
      Glaucon said: If curiosity makes a philosopher, you will find many a
      strange being will have a title to the name. All the lovers of sights have
      a delight in learning, and must therefore be included. Musical amateurs,
      too, are a folk strangely out of place among philosophers, for they are
      the last persons in the world who would come to anything like a
      philosophical discussion, if they could help, while they run about at the
      Dionysiac festivals as if they had let out their ears to hear every
      chorus; whether the performance is in town or country—that makes no
      difference—they are there. Now are we <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage475E">E</a></span> to maintain that all these and
      any who have similar tastes, as well as the professors of quite minor
      arts, are philosophers?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not, I replied; they are only an imitation.
    </p>
<p>
      He said: Who then are the true philosophers?
    </p>
<p>
      Those, I said, who are lovers of the vision of truth.
    </p>
<p>
      That is also good, he said; but I should like to know what you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      To another, I replied, I might have a difficulty in explaining; but I am
      sure that you will admit a proposition which I am about to make.
    </p>
<p>
      What is the proposition?
    </p>
<p>
      That since beauty is the opposite of ugliness, they are two?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage476A">476</a></span>
      And inasmuch as they are two, each of them is one?
    </p>
<p>
      True again.
    </p>
<p>
      And of just and unjust, good and evil, and of every other class, the same
      remark holds: taken singly, each of them is one; but from the various
      combinations of them with actions and things and with one another, they
      are seen in all sorts of lights and appear many?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And this is the distinction which I draw between the sight-<span class="pagenum"><a id="page174"></a>174</span>loving,
      art-loving, practical class and those of whom I am <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage476B">B</a></span>speaking, and who are
      alone worthy of the name of philosophers.
    </p>
<p>
      How do you distinguish them? he said.
    </p>
<p>
      The lovers of sounds and sights, I replied, are, as I conceive, fond of
      fine tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products that are
      made out of them, but their mind is incapable of seeing or loving absolute
      beauty.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Few are they who are able to attain to the sight of this.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage476C">C</a></span>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And he who, having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute
      beauty, or who, if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is
      unable to follow—of such an one I ask, Is he awake or in a dream
      only? Reflect: is not the dreamer, sleeping or waking, one who likens
      dissimilar things, who puts the copy in the place of the real object?
    </p>
<p>
      I should certainly say that such an one was dreaming.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> True knowledge is
the ability to distinguish between the one and many, between the idea
and the objects which partake of the idea.</span>
      But take the case of the other, who recognises the existence <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage476D">D</a></span>of absolute
      beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects which
      participate in the idea, neither putting the objects in the place of the
      idea nor the idea in the place of the objects—is he a dreamer, or is
      he awake?
    </p>
<p>
      He is wide awake.
    </p>
<p>
      And may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge, and
      that the mind of the other, who opines only, has opinion?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      But suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our
      statement, can we administer any soothing <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage476E">E</a></span>cordial or advice to him,
      without revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits?
    </p>
<p>
      We must certainly offer him some good advice, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Come, then, and let us think of something to say to him. Shall we begin by
      assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have, and
      that we are rejoiced at his having it? But we should like to ask him a
      question: Does he who has knowledge know something or nothing? (You must
      answer for him.)
    </p>
<p>
      I answer that he knows something. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page175"></a>175</span>
</p>
<p>
      Something that is or is not?
    </p>
<p>
      Something that is; for how can that which is not ever be known?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage477A">477</a></span><span class="sidenote"> There is an
intermediate between being and not being, and a corresponding
intermediate between ignorance and knowledge. This intermediate is a
faculty termed opinion.</span>
      And are we assured, after looking at the matter from many points of view,
      that absolute being is or may be absolutely known, but that the utterly
      non-existent is utterly unknown?
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing can be more certain.
    </p>
<p>
      Good. But if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and not
      to be, that will have a place intermediate between pure being and the
      absolute negation of being?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, between them.
    </p>
<p>
      And, as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to
      not-being, for that intermediate between being and not-being there has to
      be discovered a corresponding <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage477B">B</a></span>intermediate between ignorance and
      knowledge, if there be such?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Do we admit the existence of opinion?
    </p>
<p>
      Undoubtedly.
    </p>
<p>
      As being the same with knowledge, or another faculty?
    </p>
<p>
      Another faculty.
    </p>
<p>
      Then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter
      corresponding to this difference of faculties?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And knowledge is relative to being and knows being. But before I proceed
      further I will make a division.
    </p>
<p>
      What division?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage477C">C</a></span>
      I will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves: they are
      powers in us, and in all other things, by which we do as we do. Sight and
      hearing, for example, I should call faculties. Have I clearly explained
      the class which I mean?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I quite understand.
    </p>
<p>
      Then let me tell you my view about them. I do not see them, and therefore
      the distinctions of figure, colour, and the like, which enable me to
      discern the differences of some things, do not apply to them. In speaking
      of a faculty I think <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage477D">D</a></span>only of its sphere and its result; and that which has
      the same sphere and the same result I call the same faculty, but that
      which has another sphere and another result I call different. Would that
      be your way of speaking? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page176"></a>176</span>
</p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And will you be so very good as to answer one more question? Would you say
      that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly knowledge is a faculty, and the mightiest of all faculties.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage477E">E</a></span>
      And is opinion also a faculty?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said; for opinion is that with which we are able to form an
      opinion.
    </p>
<p>
      And yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not
      the same as opinion?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Opinion differs from knowledge because the one errs and the other is unerring.</span>
      Why, yes, he said: how can any reasonable being ever identify that which
      is infallible with that which errs?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage478A">478</a></span>
      An excellent answer, proving, I said, that we are quite conscious of a
      distinction between them.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Then knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct
      spheres or subject-matters?
    </p>
<p>
      That is certain.
    </p>
<p>
      Being is the sphere or subject-matter of knowledge, and knowledge is to
      know the nature of being?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And opinion is to have an opinion?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And do we know what we opine? or is the subject-matter of opinion the same
      as the subject-matter of knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      Nay, he replied, that has been already disproven; if difference in faculty
      implies difference in the sphere or <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage478B">B</a></span>subject-matter, and if, as we were
      saying, opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties, then the sphere of
      knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same.
    </p>
<p>
      Then if being is the subject-matter of knowledge, something else must be
      the subject-matter of opinion?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, something else.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> It also differs from ignorance, which is concerned with nothing.</span>
      Well then, is not-being the subject-matter of opinion? or, rather, how can
      there be an opinion at all about not-being? Reflect: when a man has an
      opinion, has he not an opinion about something? Can he have an opinion
      which is an opinion about nothing?
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page177"></a>177</span>
</p>
<p>
      He who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And not-being is not one thing but, properly speaking, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage478C">C</a></span>nothing?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      Of not-being, ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative; of
      being, knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then opinion is not concerned either with being or with not-being?
    </p>
<p>
      Not with either.
    </p>
<p>
      And can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      That seems to be true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Its place is not to be sought without or beyond knowledge or ignorance, but between them.</span>
      But is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them, in a
      greater clearness than knowledge, or in a greater darkness than ignorance?
    </p>
<p>
      In neither.
    </p>
<p>
      Then I suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge,
      but lighter than ignorance?
    </p>
<p>
      Both; and in no small degree.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage478D">D</a></span>
      And also to be within and between them?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Then you would infer that opinion is intermediate?
    </p>
<p>
      No question.
    </p>
<p>
      But were we not saying before, that if anything appeared to be of a sort
      which is and is not at the same time, that sort of thing would appear also
      to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute not-being; and that
      the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor ignorance, but will be
      found in the interval between them?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And in that interval there has now been discovered something which we call
      opinion?
    </p>
<p>
      There has.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage478E">E</a></span>
      Then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally of
      the nature of being and not-being, and cannot rightly be termed either,
      pure and simple; this unknown term, when discovered, we may truly call the
      subject of opinion, and assign each to their proper faculty,—<span class="pagenum"><a id="page178"></a>178</span>the
      extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to the faculty of
      the mean.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage479A">479</a></span><span class="sidenote"> The absoluteness of the one and the relativeness of the many.</span>
      This being premised, I would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that
      there is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty—in whose opinion
      the beautiful is the manifold—he, I say, your lover of beautiful
      sights, who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one, and the just
      is one, or that anything is one—to him I would appeal, saying, Will
      you be so very kind, sir, as to tell us whether, of all these beautiful
      things, there is one which will not be found ugly; or of the just, which
      will not be found unjust; or of the holy, which will not also be unholy?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage479B">B</a></span>
      No, he replied; the beautiful will in some point of view be found ugly;
      and the same is true of the rest.
    </p>
<p>
      And may not the many which are doubles be also halves?—doubles, that
      is, of one thing, and halves of another?
    </p>
<p>
      Quite true.
    </p>
<p>
      And things great and small, heavy and light, as they are termed, will not
      be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names?
    </p>
<p>
      True; both these and the opposite names will always attach to all of them.
    </p>
<p>
      And can any one of those many things which are called by particular names
      be said to be this rather than not to be this?
    </p>
<p>
      He replied: They are like the punning riddles which are <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage479C">C</a></span>asked at feasts or
      the children’s puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat, with what he hit
      him, as they say in the puzzle, and upon what the bat was sitting. The
      individual objects of which I am speaking are also a riddle, and have a
      double sense: nor can you fix them in your mind, either as being or
      not-being, or both, or neither.
    </p>
<p>
      Then what will you do with them? I said. Can they have a better place than
      between being and not-being? For they are clearly not in greater darkness
      or negation than not-being, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage479D">D</a></span>or more full of light and existence than
      being.
    </p>
<p>
      That is quite true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the
      multitude entertain about the beautiful and about <span class="pagenum"><a id="page179"></a>179</span> all other things are
      tossing about in some region which is half-way between pure being and pure
      not-being?
    </p>
<p>
      We have.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes; and we had before agreed that anything of this kind which we might
      find was to be described as matter of opinion, and not as matter of
      knowledge; being the intermediate flux which is caught and detained by the
      intermediate faculty.
    </p>
<p>
      Quite true.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage479E">E</a></span><span class="sidenote"> Opinion is the knowledge, not of the absolute, but of the many.</span>
      Then those who see the many beautiful, and who yet neither see absolute
      beauty, nor can follow any guide who points the way thither; who see the
      many just, and not absolute justice, and the like,—such persons may
      be said to have opinion but not knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      That is certain.
    </p>
<p>
      But those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to
      know, and not to have opinion only?
    </p>
<p>
      Neither can that be denied.
    </p>
<p>
      The one love and embrace the subjects of knowledge, the other those of
      opinion? The latter are the same, as I dare say <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage480A">480</a></span>you will remember, who
      listened to sweet sounds and gazed upon fair colours, but would not
      tolerate the existence of absolute beauty.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I remember.
    </p>
<p>
      Shall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers of
      opinion rather than lovers of wisdom, and will they be very angry with us
      for thus describing them?
    </p>
<p>
      I shall tell them not to be angry; no man should be angry at what is true.
    </p>
<p>
      But those who love the truth in each thing are to be called lovers of
      wisdom and not lovers of opinion.
    </p>
<p>
      Assuredly.

      A<span class="smcap">ND</span> thus, Glaucon, after the argument has gone a weary way, the true and
      the false philosophers have at length appeared in view.
    </p>
<p>
      I do not think, he said, that the way could have been shortened.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> If we had time, we might have a nearer view of the true and false philosopher.</span>
      I suppose not, I said; and yet I believe that we might have had a better
      view of both of them if the discussion could have been confined to this
      one subject and if there were not many other questions awaiting us, which
      he who desires to see in what respect the life of the just differs <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage484B">B</a></span>from
      that of the unjust must consider.
    </p>
<p>
      And what is the next question? he asked.
    </p>
<p>
      Surely, I said, the one which follows next in order. Inasmuch as
      philosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable, and
      those who wander in the region of the many and variable are not
      philosophers, I must ask you which of the two classes should be the rulers
      of our State?
    </p>
<p>
      And how can we rightly answer that question?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Which of them shall be our guardians?</span>
      Whichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage484C">C</a></span>institutions of
      our State—let them be our guardians.
    </p>
<p>
      Very good.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> A question hardly to be asked.</span>
      Neither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to
      keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?
    </p>
<p>
      There can be no question of that.
    </p>
<p>
      And are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge of
      the true being of each thing, and who have in their souls no clear
      pattern, and are unable as with a painter’s eye to look at the absolute
      truth and to that original <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage484D">D</a></span>to repair, and having perfect vision of the
      other world to order the laws about beauty, goodness, justice in this, if
      not <span class="pagenum"><a id="page181"></a>181</span> already ordered, and to guard and preserve the order of them—are
      not such persons, I ask, simply blind?
    </p>
<p>
      Truly, he replied, they are much in that condition.
    </p>
<p>
      And shall they be our guardians when there are others who, besides being
      their equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular of
      virtue, also know the very truth of each thing?
    </p>
<p>
      There can be no reason, he said, for rejecting those who have this
      greatest of all great qualities; they must always have the first place
      unless they fail in some other respect.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage485A">485</a></span>
      Suppose then, I said, that we determine how far they can unite this and
      the other excellences.
    </p>
<p>
      By all means.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The philosopher is a lover of truth and of all true being.</span>
      In the first place, as we began by observing, the nature of the
      philosopher has to be ascertained. We must come to an understanding about
      him, and, when we have done so, then, if I am not mistaken, we shall also
      acknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible, and that those in
      whom they are united, and those only, should be rulers in the State.
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      Let us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage485B">B</a></span>of a sort
      which shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and
      corruption.
    </p>
<p>
      Agreed.
    </p>
<p>
      And further, I said, let us agree that they are lovers of all true being;
      there is no part whether greater or less, or more or less honourable,
      which they are willing to renounce; as we said before of the lover and the
      man of ambition.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And if they are to be what we were describing, is there <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage485C">C</a></span>not another
      quality which they should also possess?
    </p>
<p>
      What quality?
    </p>
<p>
      Truthfulness: they will never intentionally receive into their mind
      falsehood, which is their detestation, and they will love the truth.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, that may be safely affirmed of them.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘May be,’ my friend, I replied, is not the word; say rather ‘must be
      affirmed:’ for he whose nature is amorous of anything cannot help loving
      all that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page182"></a>182</span>
</p>
<p>
      Right, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth?
    </p>
<p>
      How can there be?
    </p>
<p>
      Can the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage485D">D</a></span>falsehood?
    </p>
<p>
      Never.
    </p>
<p>
      The true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth, as far as in
      him lies, desire all truth?
    </p>
<p>
      Assuredly.
    </p>
<p>
      But then again, as we know by experience, he whose desires are strong in
      one direction will have them weaker in others; they will be like a stream
      which has been drawn off into another channel.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> He will be absorbed in the pleasures of the soul, and therefore temperate and the reverse of covetous or mean.</span>
      He whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be
      absorbed in the pleasures of the soul, and will hardly feel bodily
      pleasure—I mean, if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage485E">E</a></span>
      That is most certain.
    </p>
<p>
      Such an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous; for the
      motives which make another man desirous of having and spending, have no
      place in his character.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage486A">486</a></span>
      Another criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be considered.
    </p>
<p>
      What is that?
    </p>
<p>
      There should be no secret corner of illiberality; nothing can be more
      antagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the whole
      of things both divine and human.
    </p>
<p>
      Most true, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> In the magnificence of his contemplations he will not think much of human life.</span>
      Then how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of all
      time and all existence, think much of human life?
    </p>
<p>
      He cannot.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage486B">B</a></span>
      Or can such an one account death fearful?
    </p>
<p>
      No indeed.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page183"></a>183</span>
</p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      Or again: can he who is harmoniously constituted, who is not covetous or
      mean, or a boaster, or a coward—can he, I say, ever be unjust or
      hard in his dealings?
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> He will be of a gentle, sociable, harmonious nature; a lover of learning, having a good
memory and moving spontaneously in the world of being.</span>
      Then you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle, or rude and
      unsociable; these are the signs which distinguish even in youth the
      philosophical nature from the unphilosophical.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage486C">C</a></span>
      There is another point which should be remarked.
    </p>
<p>
      What point?
    </p>
<p>
      Whether he has or has not a pleasure in learning; for no one will love
      that which gives him pain, and in which after much toil he makes little
      progress.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      And again, if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns, will
      he not be an empty vessel?
    </p>
<p>
      That is certain.
    </p>
<p>
      Labouring in vain, he must end in hating himself and his fruitless
      occupation? Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage486D">D</a></span>
      Then a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic
      natures; we must insist that the philosopher should have a good memory?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And once more, the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend to
      disproportion?
    </p>
<p>
      Undoubtedly.
    </p>
<p>
      And do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion?
    </p>
<p>
      To proportion.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, besides other qualities, we must try to find a naturally
      well-proportioned and gracious mind, which will move spontaneously towards
      the true being of everything.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage486E">E</a></span>
      Well, and do not all these qualities, which we have been enumerating, go
      together, and are they not, in a manner, necessary to a soul, which is to
      have a full and perfect participation of being? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page184"></a>184</span>
</p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage487A">487</a></span>
      They are absolutely necessary, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Conclusion: What a blameless study then is philosophy!</span>
      And must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who has
      the gift of a good memory, and is quick to learn,—noble, gracious,
      the friend of truth, justice, courage, temperance, who are his kindred?
    </p>
<p>
      The god of jealousy himself, he said, could find no fault with such a
      study.
    </p>
<p>
      And to men like him, I said, when perfected by years and education, and to
      these only you will entrust the State.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage487B">B</a></span><span class="sidenote"> S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, A<span class="smcap">DEIMANTUS</span>.</span><span class="sidenote"> Nay, says Adeimantus, you can prove anything, but your hearers are unconvinced all the same.</span>
      Here Adeimantus interposed and said: To these statements, Socrates, no one
      can offer a reply; but when you talk in this way, a strange feeling passes
      over the minds of your hearers: They fancy that they are led astray a
      little at each step in the argument, owing to their own want of skill in
      asking and answering questions; these littles accumulate, and at the end
      of the discussion they are found to have sustained a mighty overthrow and
      all their former notions appear to be turned upside down. And as unskilful
      players of draughts are at last shut up by their more skilful adversaries
      and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage487C">C</a></span>have no piece to move, so they too find themselves shut up at last;
      for they have nothing to say in this new game of which words are the
      counters; and yet all the time they are in the right. The observation is
      suggested to me by what is now occurring. For any one of us might say,
      that although in words he is not able to meet you at each step of the
      argument, he sees as a fact that the votaries of philosophy, <span class="sidenote"> Common opinion declares philosophers to be either rogues or useless.</span>when they
      carry on the study, not only in youth as a part of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage487D">D</a></span>education, but as the
      pursuit of their maturer years, most of them become strange monsters, not
      to say utter rogues, and that those who may be considered the best of them
      are made useless to the world by the very study which you extol.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, and do you think that those who say so are wrong?
    </p>
<p>
      I cannot tell, he replied; but I should like to know what is your opinion.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Socrates, instead of denying this statement, admits the truth of it.</span>
      Hear my answer; I am of opinion that they are quite right.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage487E">E</a></span>
      Then how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease from
      evil until philosophers rule in them, when philosophers are acknowledged
      by us to be of no use to them?
    </p>
<p>
      You ask a question, I said, to which a reply can only be given in a
      parable. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page185"></a>185</span>
</p>
<p>
      Yes, Socrates; and that is a way of speaking to which you are not at all
      accustomed, I suppose.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> A parable.</span>
      I perceive, I said, that you are vastly amused at having plunged me into
      such a hopeless discussion; but now hear <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage488A">488</a></span>the parable, and then you will be
      still more amused at the meagreness of my imagination: for the manner in
      which the best men are treated in their own States is so grievous that no
      single thing on earth is comparable to it; and therefore, if I am to plead
      their cause, I must have recourse to fiction, and put together a figure
      made up of many things, like the fabulous unions of goats and stags which
      are found in pictures. <span class="sidenote"> The noble captain
whose senses are rather dull (the people in their better mind); the
mutinous crew (the mob of politicians); and the pilot (the true
philosopher).</span>Imagine then a fleet or a ship in which there is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage488B">B</a></span>a
      captain who is taller and stronger than any of the crew, but he is a
      little deaf and has a similar infirmity in sight, and his knowledge of
      navigation is not much better. The sailors are quarrelling with one
      another about the steering—every one is of opinion that he has a
      right to steer, though he has never learned the art of navigation and
      cannot tell who taught him or when he learned, and will further assert
      that it cannot be taught, and they are ready to cut in pieces any <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage488C">C</a></span>one who
      says the contrary. They throng about the captain, begging and praying him
      to commit the helm to them; and if at any time they do not prevail, but
      others are preferred to them, they kill the others or throw them
      overboard, and having first chained up the noble captain’s senses with
      drink or some narcotic drug, they mutiny and take possession of the ship
      and make free with the stores; thus, eating and drinking, they proceed on
      their voyage in such manner as <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage488D">D</a></span>might be expected of them. Him who is their
      partisan and cleverly aids them in their plot for getting the ship out of
      the captain’s hands into their own whether by force or persuasion, they
      compliment with the name of sailor, pilot, able seaman, and abuse the
      other sort of man, whom they call a good-for-nothing; but that the true
      pilot must pay attention to the year and seasons and sky and stars and
      winds, and whatever else belongs to his art, if he intends to be really
      qualified for the command of a ship, and that he must and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage488E">E</a></span>will be the
      steerer, whether other people like or not—the possibility of this
      union of authority with the steerer’s art has never seriously entered into
      their thoughts or been made <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage489A">489</a></span>part <span class="pagenum"><a id="page186"></a>186</span> of their calling<a href="#Footnotebook61" id="FnAnchorbook61" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">1</span></a>. Now in vessels which
      are in a state of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers, how will the
      true pilot be regarded? Will he not be called by them a prater, a
      star-gazer, a good-for-nothing?
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook61"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook61" class="pginternal">1</a></span> Or, applying <span class="transl" title="o(/pôs de\ kubernê/sei">ὅπως δὲ κυβερνήσει</span> to the mutineers,
‘But only understanding (<span class="transl" title="e)pai+/ontas">ἐπαΐοντας</span>) that he (the mutinous pilot)
must rule in spite of other people, never considering that there is an art
of command which may be practised in combination with the pilot’s art.’</p></div>
<p>
      Of course, said Adeimantus.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The interpretation.</span>
      Then you will hardly need, I said, to hear the interpretation of the
      figure, which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the State;
      for you understand already.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Then suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman who is surprised
      at finding that philosophers have no honour in their cities; explain it to
      him and try to convince him that <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage489B">B</a></span>their having honour would be far more
      extraordinary.
    </p>
<p>
      I will.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The uselessness of philosophers arises out of the unwillingness of mankind to make use of them.</span>
      Say to him, that, in deeming the best votaries of philosophy to be useless
      to the rest of the world, he is right; but also tell him to attribute
      their uselessness to the fault of those who will not use them, and not to
      themselves. The pilot should not humbly beg the sailors to be commanded by
      him—that is not the order of nature; neither are ‘the wise to go to
      the doors of the rich’—the ingenious author of this saying told a
      lie—but the truth is, that, when a man is ill, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage489C">C</a></span>whether he be rich or
      poor, to the physician he must go, and he who wants to be governed, to him
      who is able to govern. The ruler who is good for anything ought not to beg
      his subjects to be ruled by him; although the present governors of mankind
      are of a different stamp; they may be justly compared to the mutinous
      sailors, and the true helmsmen to those who are called by them
      good-for-nothings and star-gazers.
    </p>
<p>
      Precisely so, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The real enemies of philosophy her professing followers.</span>
      For these reasons, and among men like these, philosophy, the noblest
      pursuit of all, is not likely to be much esteemed <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage489D">D</a></span>by those of the opposite
      faction; not that the greatest and most lasting injury is done to her by
      her opponents, but by her own professing followers, the same of whom you
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page187"></a>187</span> suppose the accuser to say, that the greater number of them are arrant
      rogues, and the best are useless; in which opinion I agreed.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And the reason why the good are useless has now been explained?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The corruption of philosophy due to many causes.</span>
      Then shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority is also
      unavoidable, and that this is not to be laid to <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage489E">E</a></span>the charge of philosophy
      any more than the other?
    </p>
<p>
      By all means.
    </p>
<p>
      And let us ask and answer in turn, first going back to the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage490A">490</a></span>description of
      the gentle and noble nature. Truth, as you will remember, was his leader,
      whom he followed always and in all things; failing in this, he was an
      impostor, and had no part or lot in true philosophy.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, that was said.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, and is not this one quality, to mention no others, greatly at
      variance with present notions of him?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> But before considering this, let us re-enumerate the qualities of the philosopher:</span>
      And have we not a right to say in his defence, that the true lover of
      knowledge is always striving after being—that is his nature; he will
      not rest in the multiplicity of individuals <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage490B">B</a></span> which is an appearance only,
      but will go on—the keen edge will not be blunted, nor the force of
      his desire abate until he have attained the knowledge of the true nature
      of every essence by a sympathetic and kindred power in the soul, and by
      that power drawing near and mingling and becoming incorporate with very
      being, having begotten mind and truth, he will have knowledge and will
      live and grow truly, and then, and not till then, will he cease from his
      travail.
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing, he said, can be more just than such a description of him.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> his love of essence, of truth, of justice, besides his other virtues and natural gifts.</span>
      And will the love of a lie be any part of a philosopher’s nature? Will he
      not utterly hate a lie?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage490C">C</a></span>
      He will.
    </p>
<p>
      And when truth is the captain, we cannot suspect any evil of the band
      which he leads?
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page188"></a>188</span>
</p>
<p>
      Justice and health of mind will be of the company, and temperance will
      follow after?
    </p>
<p>
      True, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Neither is there any reason why I should again set in array the
      philosopher’s virtues, as you will doubtless remember that courage,
      magnificence, apprehension, memory, were his natural gifts. And you
      objected that, although no one could <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage490D">D</a></span>deny what I then said, still, if you
      leave words and look at facts, the persons who are thus described are some
      of them manifestly useless, and the greater number utterly depraved; we
      were then led to enquire into the grounds of these accusations, and have
      now arrived at the point of asking why are the majority bad, which
      question of necessity brought us back to the examination and definition of
      the true philosopher.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage490E">E</a></span>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The reasons why philosophical natures so easily deteriorate.</span>
      And we have next to consider the corruptions of the philosophic nature,
      why so many are spoiled and so few escape spoiling—I am speaking of
      those who were said to be <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage491A">491</a></span>useless but not wicked—and, when we have
      done with them, we will speak of the imitators of philosophy, what manner
      of men are they who aspire after a profession which is above them and of
      which they are unworthy, and then, by their manifold inconsistencies,
      bring upon philosophy, and upon all philosophers, that universal
      reprobation of which we speak.
    </p>
<p>
      What are these corruptions? he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> (1) There are but a few of them;</span>
      I will see if I can explain them to you. Every one will admit that a
      nature having in perfection all the qualities <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage491B">B</a></span>which we required in a
      philosopher, is a rare plant which is seldom seen among men.
    </p>
<p>
      Rare indeed.
    </p>
<p>
      And what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare
      natures!
    </p>
<p>
      What causes?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> (2) and they may be distracted from philosophy by their own virtues;</span>
      In the first place there are their own virtues, their courage, temperance,
      and the rest of them, every one of which praiseworthy qualities (and this
      is a most singular circumstance) destroys and distracts from philosophy
      the soul which is the possessor of them.
    </p>
<p>
      That is very singular, he replied. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page189"></a>189</span>
</p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage491C">C</a></span>
      Then there are all the ordinary goods of life—beauty, wealth,
      strength, rank, and great connections in the State—you understand
      <span class="sidenote"> and also, (3), by the ordinary goods of life.</span>the sort of things—these also have a corrupting and distracting
      effect.
    </p>
<p>
      I understand; but I should like to know more precisely what you mean about
      them.
    </p>
<p>
      Grasp the truth as a whole, I said, and in the right way; you will then
      have no difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks, and they will no
      longer appear strange to you.
    </p>
<p>
      And how am I to do so? he asked.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage491D">D</a></span>
      Why, I said, we know that all germs or seeds, whether vegetable or animal,
      when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or soil, in
      proportion to their vigour, are all the more sensitive to the want of a
      suitable environment, for evil is a greater enemy to what is good than to
      what is not.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> (4) The finer natures more liable to injury than the inferior.</span>
      There is reason in supposing that the finest natures, when under alien
      conditions, receive more injury than the inferior, because the contrast is
      greater.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage491E">E</a></span>
      And may we not say, Adeimantus, that the most gifted minds, when they are
      ill-educated, become pre-eminently bad? Do not great crimes and the spirit
      of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by education rather
      than from any inferiority, whereas weak natures are scarcely capable of
      any very great good or very great evil?
    </p>
<p>
      There I think that you are right.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage492A">492</a></span><span class="sidenote"> (5) They are not
corrupted by private sophists, but compelled by the opinion of the world
 meeting in the assembly or in some other place of resort.</span>
      And our philosopher follows the same analogy—he is like a plant
      which, having proper nurture, must necessarily grow and mature into all
      virtue, but, if sown and planted in an alien soil, becomes the most
      noxious of all weeds, unless he be preserved by some divine power. Do you
      really think, as people so often say, that our youth are corrupted by
      Sophists, or that private teachers of the art corrupt them in any degree
      worth speaking of? Are not the public who say these things <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage492B">B</a></span>the greatest of
      all Sophists? And do they not educate to perfection young and old, men and
      women alike, and fashion them after their own hearts?
    </p>
<p>
      When is this accomplished? he said. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page190"></a>190</span>
</p>
<p>
      When they meet together, and the world sits down at an assembly, or in a
      court of law, or a theatre, or a camp, or in any other popular resort, and
      there is a great uproar, and they praise some things which are being said
      or done, and blame other things, equally exaggerating both, shouting and
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage492C">C</a></span>clapping their hands, and the echo of the rocks and the place in which
      they are assembled redoubles the sound of the praise or blame—at
      such a time will not a young man’s heart, as they say, leap within him?
      Will any private training enable him to stand firm against the
      overwhelming flood of popular opinion? or will he be carried away by the
      stream? Will he not have the notions of good and evil which the public in
      general have—he will do as they do, and as they are, such will he
      be?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage492D">D</a></span>
      Yes, Socrates; necessity will compel him.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> (6) The other compulsion of violence and death.</span>
      And yet, I said, there is a still greater necessity, which has not been
      mentioned.
    </p>
<p>
      What is that?
    </p>
<p>
      The gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death, which, as you are
      aware, these new Sophists and educators, who are the public, apply when
      their words are powerless.
    </p>
<p>
      Indeed they do; and in right good earnest.
    </p>
<p>
      Now what opinion of any other Sophist, or of any private person, can be
      expected to overcome in such an unequal contest?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage492E">E</a></span>
      None, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> They must be saved, if at all, by the power of God.</span>
      No, indeed, I said, even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly;
      there neither is, nor has been, nor is ever likely to be, any different
      type of character which has had no other training in virtue but that which
      is supplied by public opinion<a href="#Footnotebook62" id="FnAnchorbook62" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">2</span></a>—I speak, my friend, of human virtue
      only; what is more than human, as the proverb says, is not included: for I
      would not have you ignorant that, in the present evil state of
      governments, whatever is saved and comes to good is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage493A">493</a></span>saved by the power of
      God, as we may truly say.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook62"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook62" class="pginternal">2</a></span> Or, taking <span class="transl" title="para\">παρὰ</span> in another sense, ‘trained to virtue on their principles.’</p></div>
<p>
      I quite assent, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Then let me crave your assent also to a further observation.
    </p>
<p>
      What are you going to say?

<p>
      Why, that all those mercenary individuals, whom the many <span class="pagenum"><a id="page191"></a>191</span> call Sophists and
      whom they deem to be their adversaries, do, in fact, teach nothing but the
      opinion of the many, that is to say, the opinions of their assemblies; and
      this is their wisdom. <span class="sidenote"> The great brute; his behaviour and temper (the people looked at from their worse side).</span>I might compare them to a man who should study the
      tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast who is fed <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage493B">B</a></span>by him—he
      would learn how to approach and handle him, also at what times and from
      what causes he is dangerous or the reverse, and what is the meaning of his
      several cries, and by what sounds, when another utters them, he is soothed
      or infuriated; and you may suppose further, that when, by continually
      attending upon him, he has become perfect in all this, he calls his
      knowledge wisdom, and makes of it a system or art, which he proceeds to
      teach, although he has no real notion of what he means by the principles
      or passions of which he is speaking, but calls this honourable and that
      dishonourable, or good or evil, or just or unjust, all in accordance <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage493C">C</a></span>with
      the tastes and tempers of the great brute. Good he pronounces to be that
      in which the beast delights and evil to be that which he dislikes; and he
      can give no other account of them except that the just and noble are the
      necessary, having never himself seen, and having no power of explaining to
      others the nature of either, or the difference between them, which is
      immense. By heaven, would not such an one be a rare educator?
    </p>
<p>
      Indeed he would.
    </p>
<p>
      And in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage493D">D</a></span>the discernment of the
      tempers and tastes of the motley multitude, whether in painting or music,
      or, finally, in politics, differ from him whom I have been describing? <span class="sidenote"> He who associates with the people will conform to their tastes and will produce only what pleases them.</span>For
      when a man consorts with the many, and exhibits to them his poem or other
      work of art or the service which he has done the State, making them his
      judges<a href="#Footnotebook63" id="FnAnchorbook63" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">3</span></a> when he is not obliged, the so-called necessity of Diomede will
      oblige him to produce whatever they praise. And yet the reasons are
      utterly ludicrous which they give in confirmation of their own notions
      about the honourable and good. Did you ever hear any of them which were
      not?

<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage493E">E</a></span>
      No, nor am I likely to hear.
    </p>
<p>
      You recognise the truth of what I have been saying? Then <span class="pagenum"><a id="page192"></a>192</span> let me ask you to
      consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe in the
      existence of absolute <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage494A">494</a></span>beauty rather than of the many beautiful, or of the
      absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the world cannot possibly be a philosopher?
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      And therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure of the
      world?
    </p>
<p>
      They must.
    </p>
<p>
      And of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please them?
    </p>
<p>
      That is evident.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, do you see any way in which the philosopher can <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage494B">B</a></span>be preserved in his
      calling to the end? and remember what we were saying of him, that he was
      to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence—these were
      admitted by us to be the true philosopher’s gifts.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The youth who has great bodily and mental gifts will be flattered from his childhood,</span>
      Will not such an one from his early childhood be in all things first among
      all, especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental ones?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And his friends and fellow-citizens will want to use him as he gets older
      for their own purposes?
    </p>
<p>
      No question.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage494C">C</a></span>
      Falling at his feet, they will make requests to him and do him honour and
      flatter him, because they want to get into their hands now, the power
      which he will one day possess.
    </p>
<p>
      That often happens, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And what will a man such as he is be likely to do under such
      circumstances, especially if he be a citizen of a great city, rich and
      noble, and a tall proper youth? Will he not be full of boundless
      aspirations, and fancy himself able to manage the affairs of Hellenes and
      of barbarians, and having got such <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage494D">D</a></span>notions into his head will he not
      dilate and elevate himself in the fulness of vain pomp and senseless
      pride?
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure he will.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> and being incapable of having reason, will be easily drawn away from philosophy.</span>
      Now, when he is in this state of mind, if some one gently comes to him and
      tells him that he is a fool and must get <span class="pagenum"><a id="page193"></a>193</span> understanding, which can only be
      got by slaving for it, do you think that, under such adverse
      circumstances, he will be easily induced to listen?
    </p>
<p>
      Far otherwise.
    </p>
<p>
      And even if there be some one who through inherent <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage494E">E</a></span>goodness or natural
      reasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and taken
      captive by philosophy, how will his friends behave when they think that
      they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping to reap from
      his companionship? Will they not do and say anything to prevent him from
      yielding to his better nature and to render his teacher powerless, using
      to this end private intrigues as well as public prosecutions?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage495A">495</a></span>
      There can be no doubt of it.
    </p>
<p>
      And how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher?
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The very qualities which make a man a philosopher may also divert him from philosophy.</span>
      Then were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which make a
      man a philosopher may, if he be ill-educated, divert him from philosophy,
      no less than riches and their accompaniments and the other so-called goods
      of life?
    </p>
<p>
      We were quite right.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus, my excellent friend, is brought about all that ruin and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage495B">B</a></span>failure
      which I have been describing of the natures best adapted to the best of
      all pursuits; they are natures which we maintain to be rare at any time;
      this being the class out of which come the men who are the authors of the
      greatest evil to States and individuals; <span class="sidenote">Great natures alone are capable, either of great good, or great evil.</span>and also of the greatest good
      when the tide carries them in that direction; but a small man never was
      the doer of any great thing either to individuals or to States.
    </p>
<p>
      That is most true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And so philosophy is left desolate, with her marriage rite <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage495C">C</a></span>incomplete: for
      her own have fallen away and forsaken her, and while they are leading a
      false and unbecoming life, other unworthy persons, seeing that she has no
      kinsmen to be her protectors, enter in and dishonour her; and fasten upon
      her the reproaches which, as you say, her reprovers utter, who affirm of
      her votaries that some are good for nothing, and that the greater number
      deserve the severest punishment. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page194"></a>194</span>
</p>
<p>
      That is certainly what people say.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The attractiveness of philosophy to the vulgar.</span>
      Yes; and what else would you expect, I said, when you think of the puny
      creatures who, seeing this land open to <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage495D">D</a></span>them—a land well stocked
      with fair names and showy titles—like prisoners running out of
      prison into a sanctuary, take a leap out of their trades into philosophy;
      those who do so being probably the cleverest hands at their own miserable
      crafts? For, although philosophy be in this evil case, still there remains
      a dignity about her which is not to be found in the arts. And many are
      thus attracted by her whose <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage495E">E</a></span>natures are imperfect and whose souls are
      maimed and disfigured by their meannesses, as their bodies are by their
      trades and crafts. Is not this unavoidable?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Are they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got out of
      durance and come into a fortune; he takes a bath and puts on a new coat,
      and is decked out as a bridegroom going to marry his master’s daughter,
      who is left poor and desolate?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage496A">496</a></span>
      A most exact parallel.
    </p>
<p>
      What will be the issue of such marriages? Will they not be vile and
      bastard?
    </p>
<p>
      There can be no question of it.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The <i>mésalliance</i> of philosophy.</span>
      And when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy and
      make an alliance with her who is in a rank above them what sort of ideas
      and opinions are likely to be generated? <a href="#Footnotebook64" id="FnAnchorbook64" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">4</span></a>Will they not be sophisms
      captivating to the ear, having nothing in them genuine, or worthy of or

<p>
      No doubt, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Few are the worthy disciples:</span>
      Then, Adeimantus, I said, the worthy disciples of philosophy <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage496B">B</a></span>will be but a
      small remnant: perchance some noble and well-educated person, detained by
      exile in her service, who in the absence of corrupting influences remains
      devoted to her; or some lofty soul born in a mean city, the politics of
      which he contemns and neglects; and there may be a gifted few who leave
      the arts, which they justly despise, and come to her;—or
      peradventure there are some who are restrained <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage496C">C</a></span>by our friend Theages’
      bridle; for everything in the life of Theages <span class="pagenum"><a id="page195"></a>195</span> conspired to divert him from
      philosophy; but ill-health kept him away from politics. My own case of the
      internal sign is hardly worth mentioning, for rarely, if ever, has such a
      monitor been given to any other man. Those who belong to this small class
      have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy is,  <span class="sidenote"> and these are unable to resist the madness of the world;</span>and have
      also seen enough of the madness of the multitude; and they know <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage496D">D</a></span>that no
      politician is honest, nor is there any champion of justice at whose side
      they may fight and be saved.Such an one may be compared to a man who has
      fallen among wild beasts—he will not join in the wickedness of his
      fellows, but neither is he able singly to resist all their fierce natures,
      and therefore seeing that he would be of no use to the State or to his
      friends, and reflecting that he would have to throw away his life without
      doing any good either to himself or others, he holds his peace, and goes
      his own way. <span class="sidenote"> they therefore in order to escape the storm take shelter behind a wall and live their own life.</span>He is like one who, in the storm of dust and sleet which the
      driving wind hurries along, retires under the shelter of a wall; and
      seeing the rest of mankind full of wickedness, he is content, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage496E">E</a></span>if only he
      can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness, and depart
      in peace and good-will, with bright hopes.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, and he will have done a great work before he departs.
    </p>
<p>
      A great work—yes; but not the greatest, unless he find <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage497A">497</a></span>a State
      suitable to him; for in a State which is suitable to him, he will have a
      larger growth and be the saviour of his country, as well as of himself.
    </p>
<p>
      The causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been
      sufficiently explained: the injustice of the charges against her has been
      shown—is there anything more which you wish to say?
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing more on that subject, he replied; but I should like to know which
      of the governments now existing is in your opinion the one adapted to her.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage497B">B</a></span><span class="sidenote"> No existing State suited to philosophy.</span>
      Not any of them, I said; and that is precisely the accusation which I
      bring against them—not one of them is worthy of the philosophic
      nature, and hence that nature is warped and estranged;—as the exotic
      seed which is sown in a foreign land becomes denaturalized, and is wont to
      be overpowered and to lose itself in the new soil, even so this growth <span class="pagenum"><a id="page196"></a>196</span> of
      philosophy, instead of persisting, degenerates and receives another
      character. But if philosophy ever finds in the State <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage497C">C</a></span>that perfection which
      she herself is, then will be seen that she is in truth divine, and that
      all other things, whether natures of men or institutions, are but human;—and
      now, I know, that you are going to ask, What that State is:
    </p>
<p>
      No, he said; there you are wrong, for I was going to ask another question—whether
      it is the State of which we are the founders and inventors, or some other?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Even our own State requires the addition of the living authority.</span>
      Yes, I replied, ours in most respects; but you may remember my saying
      before, that some living authority would always be required in the State
      having the same idea of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage497D">D</a></span>the constitution which guided you when as
      legislator you were laying down the laws.
    </p>
<p>
      That was said, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, but not in a satisfactory manner; you frightened us by interposing
      objections, which certainly showed that the discussion would be long and
      difficult; and what still remains is the reverse of easy.
    </p>
<p>
      What is there remaining?
    </p>
<p>
      The question how the study of philosophy may be so ordered as not to be
      the ruin of the State: All great attempts are attended with risk; ‘hard is
      the good,’ as men say.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage497E">E</a></span>
      Still, he said, let the point be cleared up, and the enquiry will then be
      complete.
    </p>
<p>
      I shall not be hindered, I said, by any want of will, but, if at all, by a
      want of power: my zeal you may see for yourselves; and please to remark in
      what I am about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly I declare that States
      should pursue philosophy, not as they do now, but in a different spirit.
    </p>
<p>
      In what manner?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage498A">498</a></span><span class="sidenote"> The superficial study of philosophy which exists in the present day.</span>
      At present, I said, the students of philosophy are quite young; beginning
      when they are hardly past childhood, they devote only the time saved from
      moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits; and even those of them who
      are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit, when they come within
      sight of the great difficulty of the subject, I mean dialectic, take
      themselves off. In after life when invited by some one else, they may,
      perhaps, go and hear a lecture, and about this they make much ado, for
      philosophy is not considered <span class="pagenum"><a id="page197"></a>197</span> by them to be their proper business: at last,
      when they grow old, in most cases they are extinguished more <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage498B">B</a></span>truly than
      Heracleitus’ sun, inasmuch as they never light up again<a href="#Footnotebook65" id="FnAnchorbook65" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">5</span></a>.

    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook65"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook65" class="pginternal">5</a></span> Heraclitus said
      that the sun was extinguished every evening and relighted every morning.</p></div>
<p>
      But what ought to be their course?
    </p>
<p>
      Just the opposite. In childhood and youth their study, and what philosophy
      they learn, should be suited to their tender years: during this period
      while they are growing up towards manhood, the chief and special care
      should be given to their bodies that they may have them to use in the
      service of philosophy; as life advances and the intellect begins to
      mature, let them increase the gymnastics of the soul; but when the
      strength of our citizens fails and is past civil and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage498C">C</a></span>military duties, then
      let them range at will and engage in no serious labour, as we intend them
      to live happily here, and to crown this life with a similar happiness in
      another.
    </p>
<p>
      How truly in earnest you are, Socrates! he said; I am sure of that; and
      yet most of your hearers, if I am not mistaken, are likely to be still

<p>
      Do not make a quarrel, I said, between Thrasymachus and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage498D">D</a></span>me, who have
      recently become friends, although, indeed, we were never enemies; for I
      shall go on striving to the utmost until I either convert him and other
      men, or do something which may profit them against the day when they live
      again, and hold the like discourse in another state of existence.

<p>
      You are speaking of a time which is not very near.

<p><span class="sidenote"> The people hate philosophy because they have only known bad and conventional imitations of it.</span>
      Rather, I replied, of a time which is as nothing in comparison with
      eternity. Nevertheless, I do not wonder that the many refuse to believe;
      for they have never seen that of which we are now speaking realized; they
      have seen only <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage498E">E</a></span>a conventional imitation of philosophy, consisting of words
      artificially brought together, not like these of ours having a natural
      unity. But a human being who in word and work is perfectly moulded, as far
      as he can be, into the proportion and likeness of virtue—such a man
      ruling in a city which <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage499A">499</a></span>bears the same image, they have never yet seen,
      neither one nor many of them—do you think that they ever did? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page198"></a>198</span>
</p>
<p>
      No indeed.
    </p>
<p>
      No, my friend, and they have seldom, if ever, heard free and noble
      sentiments; such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every means
      in their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge, while they
      look coldly on the subtleties of controversy, of which the end is opinion
      and strife, whether they meet with them in the courts of law or in
      society.
    </p>
<p>
      They are strangers, he said, to the words of which you speak.
    </p>
<p>
      And this was what we foresaw, and this was the reason <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage499B">B</a></span>why truth forced us
      to admit, not without fear and hesitation, that neither cities nor States
      nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small class of
      philosophers whom we termed useless but not corrupt are providentially
      compelled, whether they will or not, to take care of the State, and until
      a like necessity be laid on the State to obey them<a href="#Footnotebook66" id="FnAnchorbook66" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">6</span></a>; or until kings, or if
      not kings, the sons of kings or princes, are divinely <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage499C">C</a></span>inspired with a true
      love of true philosophy. That either or both of these alternatives are
      impossible, I see no reason to affirm: if they were so, we might indeed be

<p>
      My opinion agrees with yours, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      But do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude?
    </p>
<p>
      I should imagine not, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      O my friend, I said, do not attack the multitude: they will <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage499E">E</a></span>change their
      minds, if, not in an aggressive spirit, but gently <span class="pagenum"><a id="page199"></a>199</span> and with the view of
      soothing them and removing their dislike of over-education, you show them
      your philosophers as they really are and describe as you were just now
      doing <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage500A">500</a></span>their character and profession, and then mankind will see that he of
      whom you are speaking is not such as they supposed—if they view him
      in this new light, they will surely change their notion of him, and answer
      in another strain<a href="#Footnotebook67" id="FnAnchorbook67" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">7</span></a>. Who can be at enmity with one who loves them, who that
      is himself gentle and free from envy will be jealous of one in whom there
      is no jealousy? Nay, let me answer for you, that in a few this harsh
      temper may be found but not in the majority of mankind.
    </p>

<p>
      I quite agree with you, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage500B">B</a></span><span class="sidenote"> The feeling against philosophy is really a feeling against pretended philosophers who are always talking about persons.</span>
      And do you not also think, as I do, that the harsh feeling which the many
      entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders, who rush in
      uninvited, and are always abusing them, and finding fault with them, who
      make persons instead of things the theme of their conversation? and
      nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than this.
    </p>
<p>
      It is most unbecoming.
    </p>
<p>
      For he, Adeimantus, whose mind is fixed upon true being, has surely no
      time to look down upon the affairs of earth, or <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage500C">C</a></span>to be filled with malice
      and envy, contending against men; his eye is ever directed towards things
      fixed and immutable, which he sees neither injuring nor injured by one
      another, but all in order moving according to reason; these he imitates,
      and to these he will, as far as he can, conform himself. <span class="sidenote"> The true philosopher, who has his eye fixed upon immutable principles, will fashion States after the heavenly image.</span>Can a man help
      imitating that with which he holds reverential converse?
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      And the philosopher holding converse with the divine order, becomes
      orderly and divine, as far as the nature of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage500D">D</a></span>man allows; but like every one
      else, he will suffer from detraction.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page200"></a>200</span>
</p>
<p>
      And if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning, not only himself, but
      human nature generally, whether in States or individuals, into that which
      he beholds elsewhere, will he, think you, be an unskilful artificer of
      justice, temperance, and every civil virtue?
    </p>
<p>
      Anything but unskilful.
    </p>
<p>
      And if the world perceives that what we are saying about <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage500E">E</a></span>him is the truth,
      will they be angry with philosophy? Will they disbelieve us, when we tell
      them that no State can be happy which is not designed by artists who
      imitate the heavenly pattern?
    </p>
<p>
      They will not be angry if they understand, he said. But <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage501A">501</a></span>how will they draw
      out the plan of which you are speaking?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> He will begin with a ‘tabula rasa’ and there inscribe his laws.</span>
      They will begin by taking the State and the manners of men, from which, as
      from a tablet, they will rub out the picture, and leave a clean surface.
      This is no easy task. But whether easy or not, herein will lie the
      difference between them and every other legislator,—they will have
      nothing to do either with individual or State, and will inscribe no laws,
      until they have either found, or themselves made, a clean surface.
    </p>
<p>
      They will be very right, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Having effected this, they will proceed to trace an outline of the
      constitution?
    </p>
<p>
      No doubt.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage501B">B</a></span>
      And when they are filling in the work, as I conceive, they will often turn
      their eyes upwards and downwards: I mean that they will first look at
      absolute justice and beauty and temperance, and again at the human copy;
      and will mingle and temper the various elements of life into the image of
      a man; and this they will conceive according to that other image, which,
      when existing among men, Homer calls the form and likeness of God.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And one feature they will erase, and another they will put <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage501C">C</a></span>in, until they
      have made the ways of men, as far as possible, agreeable to the ways of
      God?
    </p>
<p>
      Indeed, he said, in no way could they make a fairer picture.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The enemies of philosophy, when they hear the truth, are gradually propitiated,</span>
      And now, I said, are we beginning to persuade those whom <span class="pagenum"><a id="page201"></a>201</span> you described as
      rushing at us with might and main, that the painter of constitutions is
      such an one as we are praising; at whom they were so very indignant
      because to his hands we committed the State; and are they growing a little
      calmer at what they have just heard?
    </p>
<p>
      Much calmer, if there is any sense in them.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage501D">D</a></span>
      Why, where can they still find any ground for objection? Will they doubt
      that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being?
    </p>
<p>
      They would not be so unreasonable.
    </p>
<p>
      Or that his nature, being such as we have delineated, is akin to the
      highest good?
    </p>
<p>
      Neither can they doubt this.
    </p>
<p>
      But again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable
      circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was? Or
      will they prefer those whom we have rejected?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage501E">E</a></span>
      Surely not.
    </p>
<p>
      Then will they still be angry at our saying, that, until philosophers bear
      rule, States and individuals will have no rest from evil, nor will this
      our imaginary State ever be realized?
    </p>
<p>
      I think that they will be less angry.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> and at length become quite gentle.</span>
      Shall we assume that they are not only less angry but <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage502A">502</a></span>quite gentle, and
      that they have been converted and for very shame, if for no other reason,
      cannot refuse to come to terms?
    </p>
<p>
      By all means, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> There may have been one son of a king a philosopher who has remained uncorrupted and has a State obedient to his will.</span>
      Then let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected. Will any
      one deny the other point, that there may be sons of kings or princes who
      are by nature philosophers?
    </p>
<p>
      Surely no man, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And when they have come into being will any one say that they must of
      necessity be destroyed; that they can hardly <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage502B">B</a></span>be saved is not denied even
      by us; but that in the whole course of ages no single one of them can
      escape—who will venture to affirm this?
    </p>
<p>
      Who indeed!
    </p>
<p>
      But, said I, one is enough; let there be one man who has a city obedient
      to his will, and he might bring into existence the ideal polity about
      which the world is so incredulous.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, one is enough. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page202"></a>202</span>
</p>
<p>
      The ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been
      describing, and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And that others should approve, of what we approve, is no miracle or
      impossibility?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage502C">C</a></span>
      I think not.
    </p>
<p>
      But we have sufficiently shown, in what has preceded, that all this, if
      only possible, is assuredly for the best.
    </p>
<p>
      We have.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Our constitution then is not unattainable.</span>
      And now we say not only that our laws, if they could be enacted, would be
      for the best, but also that the enactment of them, though difficult, is
      not impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      Very good.
    </p>
<p>
      And so with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject, but more
      remains to be discussed;—how and by <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage502D">D</a></span>what studies and pursuits will
      the saviours of the constitution be created, and at what ages are they to
      apply themselves to their several studies?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Recapitulation.</span>
      I omitted the troublesome business of the possession of women, and the
      procreation of children, and the appointment of the rulers, because I knew
      that the perfect State would be eyed with jealousy and was difficult of
      attainment; but that piece of cleverness was not of much service to me,
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage502E">E</a></span>for I had to discuss them all the same. The women and children are now
      disposed of, but the other question of the rulers must be investigated
      from the very beginning. We were saying, as you will remember, that they
      were to be lovers <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage503A">503</a></span>of their country, tried by the test of pleasures and
      pains, and neither in hardships, nor in dangers, nor at any other critical
      moment were to lose their patriotism—he was to be rejected who
      failed, but he who always came forth pure, like gold tried in the
      refiner’s fire, was to be made a ruler, and to receive honours and rewards
      in life and after death. This was the sort of thing which was being said,
      and then the argument turned aside and veiled her face; not liking to <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage503B">B</a></span>stir
      the question which has now arisen.
    </p>
<p>
      I perfectly remember, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, my friend, I said, and I then shrank from hazarding <span class="pagenum"><a id="page203"></a>203</span> the bold word;
      but now let me dare to say—<span class="sidenote"> The guardian must be a philosopher, and a philosopher must be a person of rare gifts</span>that the perfect guardian must be a
      philosopher.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, let that be affirmed.
    </p>
<p>
      And do not suppose that there will be many of them; for the gifts which
      were deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together; they are mostly
      found in shreds and patches.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage503C">C</a></span>
      What do you mean? he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The contrast of the quick and solid temperaments.</span>
      You are aware, I replied, that quick intelligence, memory, sagacity,
      cleverness, and similar qualities, do not often grow together, and that
      persons who possess them and are at the same time high-spirited and
      magnanimous are not so constituted by nature as to live orderly and in a
      peaceful and settled manner; they are driven any way by their impulses,
      and all solid principle goes out of them.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      On the other hand, those steadfast natures which can <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage503D">D</a></span>better be depended
      upon, which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable, are equally
      immovable when there is anything to be learned; they are always in a
      torpid state, and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any intellectual
      toil.
    </p>
<p>
      Quite true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> They must be united.</span>
      And yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those to whom
      the higher education is to be imparted, and who are to share in any office
      or command.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And will they be a class which is rarely found?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, indeed.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage503E">E</a></span><span class="sidenote"> He who is to hold command must be tested in many kinds of knowledge.</span>
      Then the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours and dangers and
      pleasures which we mentioned before, but there is another kind of
      probation which we did not mention—he must be exercised also in many
      kinds of knowledge, to see whether the soul will be able to endure the
      highest of all, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage504A">504</a></span>or will faint under them, as in any other studies and
      exercises.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, you are quite right in testing him. But what do you mean by
      the highest of all knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      You may remember, I said, that we divided the soul into three parts; and
      distinguished the several natures of justice, temperance, courage, and
      wisdom?
    </p>
<p>
      Indeed, he said, if I had forgotten, I should not deserve to hear more. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page204"></a>204</span>
</p>
<p>
      And do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion of
      them<a href="#Footnotebook68" id="FnAnchorbook68" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">8</span></a>?
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook68"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook68" class="pginternal">8</a></span> Cp. IV. <a href="#stpage435D" class="pginternal">435 D</a>.</p></div>
<p>
      To what do you refer?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage504B">B</a></span><span class="sidenote"> The shorter exposition of education, which has been already given, inadequate.</span>
      We were saying, if I am not mistaken, that he who wanted to see them in
      their perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way, at the
      end of which they would appear; but that we could add on a popular
      exposition of them on a level with the discussion which had preceded. And
      you replied that such an exposition would be enough for you, and so the
      enquiry was continued in what to me seemed to be a very inaccurate manner;
      whether you were satisfied or not, it is for you to say.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, I thought and the others thought that you gave us a fair
      measure of truth.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage504C">C</a></span>
      But, my friend, I said, a measure of such things which in any degree falls
      short of the whole truth is not fair measure; for nothing imperfect is the
      measure of anything, although persons are too apt to be contented and
      think that they need search no further.
    </p>
<p>
      Not an uncommon case when people are indolent.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said; and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the
      State and of the laws.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The guardian must take the longer road of the higher learning,</span>
      The guardian then, I said, must be required to take the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage504D">D</a></span>longer circuit,
      and toil at learning as well as at gymnastics, or he will never reach the
      highest knowledge of all which, as we were just now saying, is his proper
      calling.
    </p>
<p>
      What, he said, is there a knowledge still higher than this—higher
      than justice and the other virtues?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, there is. And of the virtues too we must behold not the
      outline merely, as at present—nothing short of the most finished
      picture should satisfy us. When little <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage504E">E</a></span>things are elaborated with an
      infinity of pains, in order that they may appear in their full beauty and
      utmost clearness, how ridiculous that we should not think the highest
      truths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy!
    </p>
<p>
      A right noble thought<a href="#Footnotebook69" id="FnAnchorbook69" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">9</span></a>; but do you suppose that we <span class="pagenum"><a id="page205"></a>205</span> shall refrain from
      asking you what is this highest knowledge?
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook69"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook69" class="pginternal">9</a></span> Or, separating <span class="transl" title="kai\ ma/la">καὶ μάλα</span> from <span class="transl" title="a)/xion">ἄξιον</span>,

be a gloss.</p></div>
<p><span class="sidenote"> which leads upwards at last to the idea of good.</span>
      Nay, I said, ask if you will; but I am certain that you have heard the
      answer many times, and now you either do not understand me or, as I rather
      think, you are disposed to be <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage505A">505</a></span>troublesome; for you have often been told
      that the idea of good is the highest knowledge, and that all other things
      become useful and advantageous only by their use of this. You can hardly
      be ignorant that of this I was about to speak, concerning which, as you
      have often heard me say, we know so little; and, without which, any other
      knowledge <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage505B">B</a></span>or possession of any kind will profit us nothing. Do you think
      that the possession of all other things is of any value if we do not
      possess the good? or the knowledge of all other things if we have no
      knowledge of beauty and goodness?
    </p>
<p>
      Assuredly not.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> But what is the good? Some say pleasure, others knowledge, which they absurdly explain to mean knowledge of the good.</span>
      You are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good, but
      the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by
      knowledge, but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good?
    </p>
<p>
      How ridiculous!
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage505C">C</a></span>
      Yes, I said, that they should begin by reproaching us with our ignorance
      of the good, and then presume our knowledge of it—for the good they
      define to be knowledge of the good, just as if we understood them when
      they use the term ‘good’—this is of course ridiculous.
    </p>
<p>
      Most true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity; for they
      are compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as good.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage505D">D</a></span>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      There can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which this
      question is involved.
    </p>
<p>
      There can be none.
    </p>
<p>
      Further, do we not see that many are willing to do or to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page206"></a>206</span> have or to seem
      to be what is just and honourable without the reality; but no one is
      satisfied with the appearance of good—the reality is what they seek;
      in the case of the good, appearance is despised by every one.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Every man pursues the good, but without knowing the nature of it.</span>
      Of this then, which every soul of man pursues and makes <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage505E">E</a></span>the end of all his
      actions, having a presentiment that there is such an end, and yet
      hesitating because neither knowing <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage506A">506</a></span>the nature nor having the same
      assurance of this as of other things, and therefore losing whatever good
      there is in other things,—of a principle such and so great as this
      ought the best men in our State, to whom everything is entrusted, to be in
      the darkness of ignorance?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      I am sure, I said, that he who does not know how the beautiful and the
      just are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them; and I suspect
      that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true knowledge of
      them.
    </p>
<p>
      That, he said, is a shrewd suspicion of yours.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage506B">B</a></span>
      And if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our State will be
      perfectly ordered?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The guardian ought to know these things.</span>
      Of course, he replied; but I wish that you would tell me whether you
      conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure,
      or different from either?
    </p>
<p>
      Aye, I said, I knew all along that a fastidious gentleman<a href="#Footnotebook610" id="FnAnchorbook610" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">10</span></a> like you would
      not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these matters.
    </p>

<p>
      True, Socrates; but I must say that one who like you has passed a lifetime
      in the study of philosophy should not be <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage506C">C</a></span>always repeating the opinions of
      others, and never telling his own.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know?
    </p>
<p>
      Not, he said, with the assurance of positive certainty; he has no right to
      do that: but he may say what he thinks, as a matter of opinion.
    </p>
<p>
      And do you not know, I said, that all mere opinions are bad, and the best
      of them blind? You would not deny that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page207"></a>207</span> those who have any true notion
      without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way along the
      road?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage506D">D</a></span>base, when others
      will tell you of brightness and beauty?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, G<span class="smcap">LAUCON</span>.</span>
      Still, I must implore you, Socrates, said Glaucon, not to turn away just
      as you are reaching the goal; if you will only give such an explanation of
      the good as you have already given of justice and temperance and the other
      virtues, we shall be satisfied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> We can only attain to the things of mind through the things of sense. The ‘child’ of the good.</span>
      Yes, my friend, and I shall be at least equally satisfied, but I cannot
      help fearing that I shall fail, and that my indiscreet zeal will bring
      ridicule upon me. No, sweet sirs, let us not <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage506E">E</a></span>at present ask what is the
      actual nature of the good, for to reach what is now in my thoughts would
      be an effort too great for me. But of the child of the good who is likest
      him, I would fain speak, if I could be sure that you wished to hear—otherwise,
      not.
    </p>
<p>
      By all means, he said, tell us about the child, and you shall remain in
      our debt for the account of the parent.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage507A">507</a></span>
      I do indeed wish, I replied, that I could pay, and you receive, the
      account of the parent, and not, as now, of the offspring only; take,
      however, this latter by way of interest<a href="#Footnotebook611" id="FnAnchorbook611" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">11</span></a>, and at the same time have a care
      that I do not render a false account, although I have no intention of
      deceiving you.

<p>
      Yes, we will take all the care that we can: proceed.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, but I must first come to an understanding with you, and
      remind you of what I have mentioned in the course of this discussion, and
      at many other times.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage507B">B</a></span>
      What?
    </p>
<p>
      The old story, that there is a many beautiful and a many good, and so of
      other things which we describe and define; to all of them the term ‘many’
      is applied.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good, and of other things
      to which the term ‘many’ is applied there is an absolute; for they may be
      brought under a single idea, which is called the essence of each.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page208"></a>208</span>
</p>
<p>
      The many, as we say, are seen but not known, and the ideas are known but
      not seen.
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage507C">C</a></span>
      And what is the organ with which we see the visible things?
    </p>
<p>
      The sight, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And with the hearing, I said, we hear, and with the other senses perceive
      the other objects of sense?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Sight the most complex of the senses,</span>
      But have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex
      piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived?
    </p>
<p>
      No, I never have, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then reflect; has the ear or voice need of any third or <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage507D">D</a></span>additional nature
      in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be heard?
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing of the sort.
    </p>
<p>
      No, indeed, I replied; and the same is true of most, if not all, the other
      senses—you would not say that any of them requires such an addition?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      But you see that without the addition of some other nature there is no
      seeing or being seen?
    </p>
<p>
      How do you mean?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> and, unlike the other senses, requires the addition of a third nature before it can be used. This third nature is light.</span>
      Sight being, as I conceive, in the eyes, and he who has eyes wanting to
      see; colour being also present in them, still <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage507E">E</a></span>unless there be a third
      nature specially adapted to the purpose, the owner of the eyes will see
      nothing and the colours will be invisible.
    </p>
<p>
      Of what nature are you speaking?
    </p>
<p>
      Of that which you term light, I replied.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage508A">508</a></span>
      Noble, then, is the bond which links together sight and visibility, and
      great beyond other bonds by no small difference of nature; for light is
      their bond, and light is no ignoble thing?
    </p>
<p>
      Nay, he said, the reverse of ignoble.
    </p>
<p>
      And which, I said, of the gods in heaven would you say was the lord of
      this element? Whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly and
      the visible to appear? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page209"></a>209</span>
</p>
<p>
      You mean the sun, as you and all mankind say.
    </p>
<p>
      May not the relation of sight to this deity be described as follows?
    </p>
<p>
      How?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage508B">B</a></span>
      Neither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun?
    </p>
<p>
      No.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> The eye like the sun, but not the same with it.</span>
      Yet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the sun?
    </p>
<p>
      By far the most like.
    </p>
<p>
      And the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is
      dispensed from the sun?
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the sun is not sight, but the author of sight who is recognised by
      sight?
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And this is he whom I call the child of the good, whom the good begat in
      his own likeness, to be in the visible world, in <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage508C">C</a></span>relation to sight and the
      things of sight, what the good is in the intellectual world in relation to
      mind and the things of mind:
    </p>
<p>
      Will you be a little more explicit? he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Why, you know, I said, that the eyes, when a person directs them towards
      objects on which the light of day is no longer shining, but the moon and
      stars only, see dimly, and are nearly blind; they seem to have no
      clearness of vision in them?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage508D">D</a></span><span class="sidenote"> Visible objects are to be seen only when the sun shines upon them; truth is only known when illuminated by the idea of good.</span>
      But when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines, they
      see clearly and there is sight in them?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And the soul is like the eye: when resting upon that on which truth and
      being shine, the soul perceives and understands, and is radiant with
      intelligence; but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and
      perishing, then she has opinion only, and goes blinking about, and is
      first of one opinion and then of another, and seems to have no
      intelligence?
    </p>
<p>
      Just so.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage508E">E</a></span><span class="sidenote"> The idea of good higher than science or truth (the objective than the subjective).</span>
      Now, that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing to the
      knower is what I would have you term the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page210"></a>210</span> idea of good, and this you will
      deem to be the cause of science<a href="#Footnotebook612" id="FnAnchorbook612" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">12</span></a>, and of truth in so far as the latter
      becomes the subject of knowledge; beautiful too, as are both truth and
      knowledge, you will be right in esteeming this other nature <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage509A">509</a></span>as more
      beautiful than either; and, as in the previous instance, light and sight
      may be truly said to be like the sun, and yet not to be the sun, so in
      this other sphere, science and truth may be deemed to be like the good,
      but not the good; the good has a place of honour yet higher.
    </p>

<p>
      What a wonder of beauty that must be, he said, which is the author of
      science and truth, and yet surpasses them in beauty; for you surely cannot
      mean to say that pleasure is the good?
    </p>
<p>
      God forbid, I replied; but may I ask you to consider the image in another
      point of view?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage509B">B</a></span>
      In what point of view?
    </p>
<p>
      You would say, would you not, that the sun is not only the author of
      visibility in all visible things, but of generation and nourishment and
      growth, though he himself is not generation?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> As the sun is the cause of generation, so the good is the cause of being and essence.</span>
      In like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of knowledge
      to all things known, but of their being and essence, and yet the good is
      not essence, but far exceeds essence in dignity and power.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage509C">C</a></span>
      Glaucon said, with a ludicrous earnestness: By the light of heaven, how
      amazing!
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, and the exaggeration may be set down to you; for you made me
      utter my fancies.
    </p>
<p>
      And pray continue to utter them; at any rate let us hear if there is
      anything more to be said about the similitude of the sun.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, there is a great deal more.
    </p>
<p>
      Then omit nothing, however slight.
    </p>
<p>
      I will do my best, I said; but I should think that a great deal will have
      to be omitted.
    </p>
<p>
      I hope not, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage509D">D</a></span>
      You have to imagine, then, that there are two ruling <span class="pagenum"><a id="page211"></a>211</span> powers, and that one
      of them is set over the intellectual world, the other over the visible. I
      do not say heaven, lest you should fancy that I am playing upon the name
      (<span class="transl" title="ou)rano/s, o(rato/s">οὐρανός, ὁρατός</span>). May I suppose that you have this distinction of the
      visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?
    </p>
<p>
      I have.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The two spheres of sight and knowledge are represented by a line which is divided into two unequal parts.</span>
      Now take a line which has been cut into two unequal<a href="#Footnotebook613" id="FnAnchorbook613" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">13</span></a> parts, and divide each
      of them again in the same proportion, and suppose the two main divisions
      to answer, one to the visible and the other to the intelligible, and then
      compare the subdivisions in respect of their clearness and want of
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage509E">E</a></span>clearness, and you will find that the first section in the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage510A">510</a></span>sphere of the
      visible consists of images. And by images I mean, in the first place,
      shadows, and in the second place, reflections in water and in solid,
      smooth and polished bodies and the like: Do you understand?
    </p>

<p>
      Yes, I understand.
    </p>
<p>
      Imagine, now, the other section, of which this is only the resemblance, to
      include the animals which we see, and everything that grows or is made.
    </p>
<p>
      Very good.
    </p>
<p>
      Would you not admit that both the sections of this division have different
      degrees of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the sphere of
      opinion is to the sphere of knowledge?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage510B">B</a></span>
      Most undoubtedly.
    </p>
<p>
      Next proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the
      intellectual is to be divided.
    </p>
<p>
      In what manner?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Images and hypotheses.</span>
      Thus:—There are two subdivisions, in the lower of which the soul
      uses the figures given by the former division as images; the enquiry can
      only be hypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle descends
      to the other end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes out of
      hypotheses, and goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses, making
      no use of images<a href="#Footnotebook614" id="FnAnchorbook614" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">14</span></a> as in the former case, but proceeding only in and through
      the ideas themselves.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook614"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook614" class="pginternal">14</a></span> Reading <span class="transl" title="ô(=nper e)kei=no ei)ko/nôn">ὧνπερ ἐκεῖνο εἰκόνων</span>.</p></div>
<p>
      I do not quite understand your meaning, he said. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page212"></a>212</span>
</p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage510C">C</a></span><span class="sidenote"> The hypotheses of mathematics.</span>
      Then I will try again; you will understand me better when I have made some
      preliminary remarks. You are aware that students of geometry, arithmetic,
      and the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and the figures and
      three kinds of angles and the like in their several branches of science;
      these are their hypotheses, which they and every body are supposed to
      know, and therefore they do not deign to give any account of them either
      to themselves or others; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage510D">D</a></span>but they begin with them, and go on until they
      arrive at last, and in a consistent manner, at their conclusion?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, I know.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> In both spheres
hypotheses are used, in the lower taking the form of images, but in the
higher the soul ascends above hypotheses to the idea of good.</span>
      And do you not know also that although they make use of the visible forms
      and reason about them, they are thinking not of these, but of the ideals
      which they resemble; not of the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage510E">E</a></span> figures which they draw, but of the
      absolute square and the absolute diameter, and so on—the forms which
      they draw or make, and which have shadows and reflections in water of
      their own, are converted by them into images, but they are really seeking
      to behold the things themselves, which can only be seen with the eye of
      the mind?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage511A">511</a></span>
      That is true.
    </p>
<p>
      And of this kind I spoke as the intelligible, although in the search after
      it the soul is compelled to use hypotheses; not ascending to a first
      principle, because she is unable to rise above the region of hypothesis,
      but employing the objects of which the shadows below are resemblances in
      their turn as images, they having in relation to the shadows and
      reflections of them a greater distinctness, and therefore a higher value.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage511B">B</a></span>
      I understand, he said, that you are speaking of the province of geometry
      and the sister arts.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Dialectic by the help of hypotheses rises above hypotheses.</span>
      And when I speak of the other division of the intelligible, you will
      understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason
      herself attains by the power of dialectic, using the hypotheses not as
      first principles, but only as hypotheses—that is to say, as steps
      and points of departure into a world which is above hypotheses, in order
      that she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole; and
      clinging to this and then to that which depends on this, by successive
      steps she descends again without the aid of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page213"></a>213</span> <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage511C">C</a></span>any sensible object, from
      ideas, through ideas, and in ideas she ends.
    </p>
<p>
      I understand you, he replied; not perfectly, for you seem to me to be
      describing a task which is really tremendous; but, at any rate, I
      understand you to say that knowledge and being, which the science of
      dialectic contemplates, are clearer than the notions of the arts, as they
      are termed, which proceed from hypotheses only: these are also
      contemplated by the understanding, and not by the senses: yet, because
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage511D">D</a></span>they start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle, those who
      contemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher reason upon
      them, although when a first principle is added to them they are cognizable
      by the higher reason. <span class="sidenote"> Return to psychology.</span>And the habit which is concerned with geometry and
      the cognate sciences I suppose that you would term understanding and not
      reason, as being intermediate between opinion and reason.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote"> Four faculties: Reason, understanding, faith, perception of shadows.</span>
      You have quite conceived my meaning, I said; and now, corresponding to
      these four divisions, let there be four faculties in the soul—reason
      answering to the highest, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage511E">E</a></span>understanding to the second, faith (or
      conviction) to the third, and perception of shadows to the last—and
      let there be a scale of them, and let us suppose that the several
      faculties have clearness in the same degree that their objects have truth.
    </p>
<p>
      I understand, he replied, and give my assent, and accept your arrangement.

      A<span class="smcap">ND</span> now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened
      or unenlightened:—Behold! human beings living in a underground den,
      which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den;
      here they have been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks
      chained so that they cannot move, and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage514B">B</a></span>can only see before them, being
      prevented by the chains from turning round their heads. Above and behind
      them a fire is blazing at a distance, and between the fire and the
      prisoners there is a raised way; and you will see, if you look, a low wall
      built along the way, like the screen which marionette players have in
      front of them, over which they show the puppets.
    </p>
<p>
      I see.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">the low wall, and the moving figures of which the shadows are seen on the opposite wall of the den.</span>
      And do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage514C">C</a></span>all sorts of
      vessels, and statues and figures of animals <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage515A">515</a></span>made of wood and stone and
      various materials, which appear over the wall? Some of them are talking,
      others silent.
    </p>
<p>
      You have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners.
    </p>
<p>
      Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or the
      shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the
      cave?
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said; how could they see anything but the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage515B">B</a></span>shadows if they were
      never allowed to move their heads?
    </p>
<p>
      And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only
      see the shadows?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And if they were able to converse with one another, would they not suppose
      that they were naming what was actually before them<a href="#Footnotebook71" id="FnAnchorbook71" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">1</span></a>? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page215"></a>215</span>
</p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook71"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook71" class="pginternal">1</a></span> Reading <span class="transl" title="paro/nta">παρόντα</span>.</p></div>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The prisoners would mistake the shadows for realities.</span>
      And suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the other
      side, would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers-by spoke
      that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow?
    </p>
<p>
      No question, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage515C">C</a></span>
      To them, I said, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of
      the images.
    </p>
<p>
      That is certain.
    </p>
<p>
      And now look again, and see what will naturally follow if the prisoners
      are released and disabused of their error. At first, when any of them is
      liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and
      walk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains; the glare
      will distress him, and he will be unable to see the realities of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage515D">D</a></span>which in
      his former state he had seen the shadows; and then conceive some one
      saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but that now, when
      he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards more real
      existence, he has a clearer vision,—what will be his reply? <span class="sidenote">And when released, they would still persist in maintaining the superior truth of the shadows.</span>And you
      may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they
      pass and requiring him to name them,—will he not be perplexed? Will
      he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the
      objects which are now shown to him?
    </p>
<p>
      Far truer.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage515E">E</a></span>
      And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have a
      pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the
      objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in
      reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">When dragged upwards, they would be dazzled by excess of light.</span>
      And suppose once more, that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and
      rugged ascent, and held fast until he is forced into the presence of the
      sun himself, is he not likely to be <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage516A">516</a></span>pained and irritated? When he
      approaches the light his eyes will be dazzled, and he will not be able to
      see anything at all of what are now called realities.
    </p>
<p>
      Not all in a moment, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      He will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page216"></a>216</span> upper world. And
      first he will see the shadows best, next the reflections of men and other
      objects in the water, and then the objects themselves; then he will gaze
      upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled heaven; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage516B">B</a></span>and he
      will see the sky and the stars by night better than the sun or the light
      of the sun by day?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">At length they will see the sun and understand his nature.</span>
      Last of all he will be able to see the sun, and not mere reflections of
      him in the water, but he will see him in his own proper place, and not in
      another; and he will contemplate him as he is.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      He will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and the
      years, and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world, and in a
      certain way the cause of all <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage516C">C</a></span>things which he and his fellows have been
      accustomed to behold?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly, he said, he would first see the sun and then reason about him.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">They would then pity their old companions of the den.</span>
      And when he remembered his old habitation, and the wisdom of the den and
      his fellow-prisoners, do you not suppose that he would felicitate himself
      on the change, and pity them?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he would.
    </p>
<p>
      And if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves on
      those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark which
      of them went before, and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage516D">D</a></span>which followed after, and which were together;
      and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to the future, do
      you think that he would care for such honours and glories, or envy the
      possessors of them? Would he not say with Homer,
    </p>
<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="noind">
      ‘Better to be the poor servant of a poor master,’
    </p></div></div>
<p class="noind">
      and to endure anything, rather than think as they do and live after their
      manner?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage516E">E</a></span>
      Yes, he said, I think that he would rather suffer anything than entertain
      these false notions and live in this miserable manner.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">But when they returned to the den they would see much worse than those who had never left it.</span>
      Imagine once more, I said, such an one coming suddenly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page217"></a>217</span> out of the sun to
      be replaced in his old situation; would he not be certain to have his eyes
      full of darkness?
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring the
      shadows with the prisoners who had never <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage517A">517</a></span>moved out of the den, while his
      sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and the time
      which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very
      considerable), would he not be ridiculous? Men would say of him that up he
      went and down he came without his eyes; and that it was better not even to
      think of ascending; and if any one tried to loose another and lead him up
      to the light, let them only catch the offender, and they would put him to
      death.
    </p>
<p>
      No question, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The prison is the world of sight, the light of the fire is the sun.</span>
      This entire allegory, I said, you may now append, dear <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage517B">B</a></span>Glaucon, to the
      previous argument; the prison-house is the world of sight, the light of
      the fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret the
      journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual world
      according to my poor belief, which, at your desire, I have expressed—whether
      rightly or wrongly God knows. But, whether true or false, my opinion is
      that in the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all, and
      is seen <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage517C">C</a></span>only with an effort; and, when seen, is also inferred to be the
      universal author of all things beautiful and right, parent of light and of
      the lord of light in this visible world, and the immediate source of
      reason and truth in the intellectual; and that this is the power upon
      which he who would act rationally either in public or private life must
      have his eye fixed.
    </p>
<p>
      I agree, he said, as far as I am able to understand you.
    </p>
<p>
      Moreover, I said, you must not wonder that those who attain to this
      beatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs; for their souls
      are ever hastening into the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage517D">D</a></span>upper world where they desire to dwell; which
      desire of theirs is very natural, if our allegory may be trusted.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, very natural.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Nothing extraordinary in the philosopher being unable to see in the dark.</span>
      And is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine
      contemplations to the evil state of man, misbehaving <span class="pagenum"><a id="page218"></a>218</span> himself in a
      ridiculous manner; if, while his eyes are blinking and before he has
      become accustomed to the surrounding darkness, he is compelled to fight in
      courts of law, or in other places, about the images or the shadows of
      images <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage517E">E</a></span>of justice, and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those
      who have never yet seen absolute justice?
    </p>
<p>
      Anything but surprising, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage518A">518</a></span> <span class="sidenote">The eyes may be blinded in two ways, by excess or by defect of light.</span>
      Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the
      eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out
      of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind’s
      eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this when he
      sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too ready to
      laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the
      brighter life, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark, or
      having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage518B">B</a></span>And
      he will count the one happy in his condition and state of being, and he
      will pity the other; or, if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which
      comes from below into the light, there will be more reason in this than in
      the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of the light into
      the den.
    </p>
<p>
      That, he said, is a very just distinction.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The conversion of the soul is the turning round the eye from darkness to light.</span>
      But then, if I am right, certain professors of education must be wrong
      when they say that they can put a knowledge <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage518C">C</a></span>into the soul which was not
      there before, like sight into blind eyes.
    </p>
<p>
      They undoubtedly say this, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Whereas, our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning exists
      in the soul already; and that just as the eye was unable to turn from
      darkness to light without the whole body, so too the instrument of
      knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the
      world of becoming into that of being, and learn by degrees to endure the
      sight of being, and of the brightest and best of being, or <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage518D">D</a></span>in other words,
      of the good.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the easiest
      and quickest manner; not implanting <span class="pagenum"><a id="page219"></a>219</span> the faculty of sight, for that exists
      already, but has been turned in the wrong direction, and is looking away
      from the truth?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, such an art may be presumed.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The virtue of wisdom has a divine power which may be turned either towards good or towards evil.</span>
      And whereas the other so-called virtues of the soul seem to be akin to
      bodily qualities, for even when they are not <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage518E">E</a></span> originally innate they can be
      implanted later by habit and exercise, the virtue of wisdom more than
      anything else contains a divine element which always remains, and by this
      conversion is rendered useful and profitable; or, on the other hand,
      hurtful and useless. Did you never observe the narrow <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage519A">519</a></span>intelligence
      flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue—how eager he is, how
      clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end; he is the reverse of
      blind, but his keen eye-sight is forced into the service of evil, and he
      is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      But what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days of
      their youth; and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures, such
      as eating and drinking, which, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage519B">B</a></span>like leaden weights, were attached to them
      at their birth, and which drag them down and turn the vision of their
      souls upon the things that are below—if, I say, they had been
      released from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction, the
      very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as they see
      what their eyes are turned to now.
    </p>
<p>
      Very likely.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Neither the uneducated nor the overeducated will be good servants of the State.</span>
      Yes, I said; and there is another thing which is likely, or rather a
      necessary inference from what has preceded, that neither the uneducated
      and uninformed of the truth, nor <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage519C">C</a></span>yet those who never make an end of their
      education, will be able ministers of State; not the former, because they
      have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their actions, private
      as well as public; nor the latter, because they will not act at all except
      upon compulsion, fancying that they are already dwelling apart in the
      islands of the blest.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, I said, the business of us who are the founders of the State will be
      to compel the best minds to attain that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page220"></a>220</span> knowledge which we have already
      shown to be the greatest of all—they must continue to ascend until
      they arrive at the good; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage519D">D</a></span>but when they have ascended and seen enough we
      must not allow them to do as they do now.
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Men should ascend to the upper world, but they should also return to the lower.</span>
      I mean that they remain in the upper world: but this must not be allowed;
      they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the den, and
      partake of their labours and honours, whether they are worth having or
      not.
    </p>
<p>
      But is not this unjust? he said; ought we to give them a worse life, when
      they might have a better?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage519E">E</a></span>
      You have again forgotten, my friend, I said, the intention of the
      legislator, who did not aim at making any one class in the State happy
      above the rest; the happiness was to be in the whole State, and he held
      the citizens together by persuasion and necessity, making them benefactors
      of the State, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage520A">520</a></span>and therefore benefactors of one another; to this end he
      created them, not to please themselves, but to be his instruments in
      binding up the State.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said, I had forgotten.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The duties of philosophers.</span>
      Observe, Glaucon, that there will be no injustice in compelling our
      philosophers to have a care and providence of others; we shall explain to
      them that in other States, men <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage520B">B</a></span>of their class are not obliged to share in
      the toils of politics: and this is reasonable, for they grow up at their
      own sweet will, and the government would rather not have them. Being
      self-taught, they cannot be expected to show any gratitude for a culture
      which they have never received. But we have brought you into the world to
      be rulers of the hive, kings of yourselves and of the other citizens, and
      have educated you far better and more perfectly than they have been
      educated, and you are better able to share in the double duty. <span class="sidenote">Their obligations to their country will induce them to take part in her government.</span><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage520C">C</a></span>Wherefore
      each of you, when his turn comes, must go down to the general underground
      abode, and get the habit of seeing in the dark. When you have acquired the
      habit, you will see ten thousand times better than the inhabitants of the
      den, and you will know what the several images are, and what they
      represent, because you have seen the beautiful and just and good in their
      truth. And thus our State, which is also yours, will be a reality, and not
      a dream <span class="pagenum"><a id="page221"></a>221</span> only, and will be administered in a spirit unlike that of other
      States, in which men fight with one another about shadows only and are
      distracted in the struggle for power, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage520D">D</a></span>which in their eyes is a great good.
      Whereas the truth is that the State in which the rulers are most reluctant
      to govern is always the best and most quietly governed, and the State in
      which they are most eager, the worst.
    </p>
<p>
      Quite true, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And will our pupils, when they hear this, refuse to take their turn at the
      toils of State, when they are allowed to spend the greater part of their
      time with one another in the heavenly light?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage520E">E</a></span> <span class="sidenote">They will be willing but not anxious to rule.</span>
      Impossible, he answered; for they are just men, and the commands which we
      impose upon them are just; there can be no doubt that every one of them
      will take office as a stern necessity, and not after the fashion of our
      present rulers of State.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, my friend, I said; and there lies the point. You <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage521A">521</a></span>must contrive for
      your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler, and
      then you may have a well-ordered State; <span class="sidenote">The statesman must be provided with a better life than that of a ruler; and then he will not covet office.</span>for only in the State which offers
      this, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver and gold, but in
      virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of life. Whereas if they
      go to the administration of public affairs, poor and hungering after their
      own private advantage, thinking that hence they are to snatch the chief
      good, order there can never be; for they will be fighting about office,
      and the civil and domestic broils which thus arise will be the ruin of the
      rulers themselves and of the whole State.
    </p>
<p>
      Most true, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage521B">B</a></span>
      And the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition is
      that of true philosophy. Do you know of any other?
    </p>
<p>
      Indeed, I do not, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task? For, if they are,
      there will be rival lovers, and they will fight.
    </p>
<p>
      No question.
    </p>
<p>
      Who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians? Surely they will
      be the men who are wisest about affairs of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page222"></a>222</span> State, and by whom the State is
      best administered, and who at the same time have other honours and another
      and a better life than that of politics?
    </p>
<p>
      They are the men, and I will choose them, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage521C">C</a></span>
      And now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced, and
      how they are to be brought from darkness to light,—as some are said
      to have ascended from the world below to the gods?
    </p>
<p>
      By all means, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The training of the guardians.</span>
      The process, I said, is not the turning over of an oyster-shell<a href="#Footnotebook72" id="FnAnchorbook72" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">2</span></a>, but the turning round of a soul passing from a day which
      is little better than night to the true day of being, that is, the ascent
      from below<a href="#Footnotebook73" id="FnAnchorbook73" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">3</span></a>, which we affirm to be true philosophy?

<p>
      Quite so.
    </p>
<p>
      And should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage521D">D</a></span>power of
      effecting such a change?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">What knowledge will draw the soul upwards?</span>
      What sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming to
      being? And another consideration has just occurred to me: You will
      remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, that was said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?
    </p>
<p>
      What quality?
    </p>
<p>
      Usefulness in war.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, if possible.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Recapitulation.</span>
      There were two parts in our former scheme of education, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage521E">E</a></span>were there not?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">There were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there not?</span>
      Just so.
    </p>
<p>
      There was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the body,
      and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and
      corruption?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage522A">522</a></span>
      Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page223"></a>223</span>
</p>
<p>
      No.
    </p>
<p>
      But what do you say of music, which also entered to a certain extent into
      our former scheme?
    </p>
<p>
      Music, he said, as you will remember, was the counterpart of gymnastic,
      and trained the guardians by the influences of habit, by harmony making
      them harmonious, by rhythm rhythmical, but not giving them science; and
      the words, whether fabulous or possibly true, had kindred elements of
      rhythm and harmony in them. But in music there was <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage522B">B</a></span>nothing which tended to
      that good which you are now seeking.
    </p>
<p>
      You are most accurate, I said, in your recollection; in music there
      certainly was nothing of the kind. But what branch of knowledge is there,
      my dear Glaucon, which is of the desired nature; since all the useful arts
      were reckoned mean by us?
    </p>
<p>
      Undoubtedly; and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded, and the arts are
      also excluded, what remains?
    </p>
<p>
      Well, I said, there may be nothing left of our special subjects; and then
      we shall have to take something which is not special, but of universal
      application.
    </p>
<p>
      What may that be?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage522C">C</a></span> <span class="sidenote">There remains for the second education, arithmetic;</span>
      A something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in common,
      and which every one first has to learn among the elements of education.
    </p>
<p>
      What is that?
    </p>
<p>
      The little matter of distinguishing one, two, and three—in a word,
      number and calculation:—do not all arts and sciences necessarily
      partake of them?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the art of war partakes of them?
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage522D">D</a></span>
      Then Palamedes, whenever he appears in tragedy, proves Agamemnon
      ridiculously unfit to be a general. Did you never remark how he declares
      that he had invented number, and had numbered the ships and set in array
      the ranks of the army at Troy; which implies that they had never been
      numbered before, and Agamemnon must be supposed literally to have been
      incapable of counting his own feet—how could he if he was ignorant
      of number? And if that is true, what sort of general must he have been? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page224"></a>224</span>
</p>
<p>
      I should say a very strange one, if this was as you say.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage522E">E</a></span>
      Can we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly he should, if he is to have the smallest understanding of
      military tactics, or indeed, I should rather say, if he is to be a man at
      all.
    </p>
<p>
      I should like to know whether you have the same notion which I have of
      this study?
    </p>
<p>
      What is your notion?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">that being a study which leads naturally to reflection, for</span>
      It appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage523A">523</a></span>seeking, and which
      leads naturally to reflection, but never to have been rightly used; for
      the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being.
    </p>
<p>
      Will you explain your meaning? he said.
    </p>
<p>
      I will try, I said; and I wish you would share the enquiry with me, and
      say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ when I attempt to distinguish in my own mind what
      branches of knowledge have this attracting power, in order that we may
      have clearer proof that arithmetic is, as I suspect, one of them.
    </p>
<p>
      Explain, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">reflection is aroused by contradictory impressions of sense.</span>
      I mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds; some <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage523B">B</a></span>of them do not
      invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them; while in
      the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that further enquiry
      is imperatively demanded.
    </p>
<p>
      You are clearly referring, he said, to the manner in which the senses are
      imposed upon by distance, and by painting in light and shade.
    </p>
<p>
      No, I said, that is not at all my meaning.
    </p>
<p>
      Then what is your meaning?
    </p>
<p>
      When speaking of uninviting objects, I mean those which <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage523C">C</a></span>do not pass from
      one sensation to the opposite; inviting objects are those which do; in
      this latter case the sense coming upon the object, whether at a distance
      or near, gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular than of its
      opposite. An illustration will make my meaning clearer:—here are
      three fingers—a little finger, a second finger, and a middle finger.
    </p>
<p>
      Very good. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page225"></a>225</span>
</p>
<p>
      You may suppose that they are seen quite close: And here comes the point.
    </p>
<p>
      What is it?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">No difficulty in simple perception.</span>
      Each of them equally appears a finger, whether seen in the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage523D">D</a></span>middle or at
      the extremity, whether white or black, or thick or thin—it makes no
      difference; a finger is a finger all the same. In these cases a man is not
      compelled to ask of thought the question what is a finger? for the sight
      never intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a finger.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And therefore, I said, as we might expect, there is nothing <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage523E">E</a></span>here which
      invites or excites intelligence.
    </p>
<p>
      There is not, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">But the same
senses at the same time give different impressions which are at first
indistinct and have to be distinguished by the mind.</span>
      But is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers?
      Can sight adequately perceive them? and is no difference made by the
      circumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at the
      extremity? And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the
      qualities of thickness or thinness, of softness or hardness? And so of the
      other senses; do they give perfect intimations of such matters? <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage524A">524</a></span>Is not
      their mode of operation on this wise—the sense which is concerned
      with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the
      quality of softness, and only intimates to the soul that the same thing is
      felt to be both hard and soft?
    </p>
<p>
      You are quite right, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense
      gives of a hard which is also soft? What, again, is the meaning of light
      and heavy, if that which is light is also heavy, and that which is heavy,
      light?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage524B">B</a></span>
      Yes, he said, these intimations which the soul receives are very curious
      and require to be explained.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The aid of numbers is invoked in order to remove the confusion.</span>
      Yes, I said, and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons to her
      aid calculation and intelligence, that she may see whether the several
      objects announced to her are one or two.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And if they turn out to be two, is not each of them one and different?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page226"></a>226</span>
</p>
<p>
      And if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage524C">C</a></span>two as in a
      state of division, for if there were undivided they could only be
      conceived of as one?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      The eye certainly did see both small and great, but only in a confused
      manner; they were not distinguished.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The chaos then begins to be defined.</span>
      Whereas the thinking mind, intending to light up the chaos, was compelled
      to reverse the process, and look at small and great as separate and not
      confused.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      Was not this the beginning of the enquiry ‘What is great?’ and ‘What is
      small?’
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly so.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The parting of the visible and intelligible.</span>
      And thus arose the distinction of the visible and the intelligible.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage524D">D</a></span>
      Most true.
    </p>
<p>
      This was what I meant when I spoke of impressions which invited the
      intellect, or the reverse—those which are simultaneous with opposite
      impressions, invite thought; those which are not simultaneous do not.
    </p>
<p>
      I understand, he said, and agree with you.
    </p>
<p>
      And to which class do unity and number belong?
    </p>
<p>
      I do not know, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Thought is aroused by the contradiction of the one and many.</span>
      Think a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply the
      answer; for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the sight or
      by any other sense, then, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage524E">E</a></span>as we were saying in the case of the finger,
      there would be nothing to attract towards being; but when there is some
      contradiction always present, and one is the reverse of one and involves
      the conception of plurality, then thought begins to be aroused within us,
      and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive at a decision asks ‘What is
      absolute unity?’ This <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage525A">525</a></span>is the way in which the study of the one has a power
      of drawing and converting the mind to the contemplation of true being.
    </p>
<p>
      And surely, he said, this occurs notably in the case of one; for we see
      the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said; and this being true of one must be equally true of all
      number? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page227"></a>227</span>
</p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage525B">B</a></span>
      And they appear to lead the mind towards truth?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, in a very remarkable manner.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Arithmetic has a practical and also a philosophical use, the latter the higher.</span>
      Then this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking, having a
      double use, military and philosophical; for the man of war must learn the
      art of number or he will not know how to array his troops, and the
      philosopher also, because he has to rise out of the sea of change and lay
      hold of true being, and therefore he must be an arithmetician.
    </p>
<p>
      That is true.
    </p>
<p>
      And our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Then this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe;
      and we must endeavour to persuade those <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage525C">C</a></span>who are to be the principal men of
      our State to go and learn arithmetic, not as amateurs, but they must carry
      on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind only; nor
      again, like merchants or retail-traders, with a view to buying or selling,
      but for the sake of their military use, and of the soul herself; and
      because this will be the easiest way for her to pass from becoming to
      truth and being.
    </p>
<p>
      That is excellent, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, and now having spoken of it, I must add <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage525D">D</a></span>how charming the
      science is! and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end, if
      pursued in the spirit of a philosopher, and not of a shopkeeper!
    </p>
<p>
      How do you mean?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The higher arithmetic is concerned, not with visible or tangible objects, but with abstract numbers.</span>
      I mean, as I was saying, that arithmetic has a very great and elevating
      effect, compelling the soul to reason about abstract number, and rebelling
      against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into the argument.
      You know <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage525E">E</a></span>how steadily the masters of the art repel and ridicule any one
      who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is calculating, and if you
      divide, they multiply<a href="#Footnotebook74" id="FnAnchorbook74" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">4</span></a>, taking care that one shall continue one and not
      become lost in fractions. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page228"></a>228</span>
</p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook74"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook74" class="pginternal">4</a></span>  Meaning either (1) that they integrate the number
      because they deny the possibility of fractions; or (2) that division is
      regarded by them as a process of multiplication, for the fractions of one
      continue to be units.</p></div>
<p>
      That is very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage526A">526</a></span>
      Now, suppose a person were to say to them: O my friends, what are these
      wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as you say,
      there is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is equal, invariable,
      indivisible,—what would they answer?
    </p>
<p>
      They would answer, as I should conceive, that they were speaking of those
      numbers which can only be realized in thought.
    </p>
<p>
      Then you see that this knowledge may be truly called <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage526B">B</a></span>necessary,
      necessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the
      attainment of pure truth?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes; that is a marked characteristic of it.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The arithmetician is naturally quick, and the study of arithmetic gives him still greater quickness.</span>
      And have you further observed, that those who have a natural talent for
      calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge; and even
      the dull, if they have had an arithmetical training, although they may
      derive no other advantage from it, always become much quicker than they
      would otherwise have been.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage526C">C</a></span>
      And indeed, you will not easily find a more difficult study, and not many
      as difficult.
    </p>
<p>
      You will not.
    </p>
<p>
      And, for all these reasons, arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which the
      best natures should be trained, and which must not be given up.
    </p>
<p>
      I agree.
    </p>
<p>
      Let this then be made one of our subjects of education. And next, shall we
      enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us?
    </p>
<p>
      You mean geometry?
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly so.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage526D">D</a></span> <span class="sidenote">Geometry has practical applications;</span>
      Clearly, he said, we are concerned with that part of geometry which
      relates to war; for in pitching a camp, or taking up a position, or
      closing or extending the lines of an army, or any other military
      manoeuvre, whether in actual battle or on a march, it will make all the
      difference whether a general is or is not a geometrician.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">these however are trifling in comparison with that greater part of the science which tends towards the good,</span>
      Yes, I said, but for that purpose a very little of either geometry or
      calculation will be enough; the question relates <span class="pagenum"><a id="page229"></a>229</span> rather to the greater and
      more advanced part of geometry—<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage526E">E</a></span>whether that tends in any degree to
      make more easy the vision of the idea of good; and thither, as I was
      saying, all things tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze towards
      that place, where is the full perfection of being, which she ought, by all
      means, to behold.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then if geometry compels us to view being, it concerns us; if becoming
      only, it does not concern us?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage527A">527</a></span>
      Yes, that is what we assert.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not deny
      that such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction to the
      ordinary language of geometricians.
    </p>
<p>
      How so?
    </p>
<p>
      They have in view practice only, and are always speaking, in a narrow and
      ridiculous manner, of squaring and extending and applying and the like—they
      confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life; whereas
      knowledge is the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage527B">B</a></span>real object of the whole science.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then must not a further admission be made?
    </p>
<p>
      What admission?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">and is concerned with the eternal.</span>
      That the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal, and
      not of aught perishing and transient.
    </p>
<p>
      That, he replied, may be readily allowed, and is true.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, my noble friend, geometry will draw the soul towards truth, and
      create the spirit of philosophy, and raise up that which is now unhappily
      allowed to fall down.
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing will be more likely to have such an effect.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage527C">C</a></span>
      Then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants of
      your fair city should by all means learn geometry. Moreover the science
      has indirect effects, which are not small.
    </p>
<p>
      Of what kind? he said.
    </p>
<p>
      There are the military advantages of which you spoke, I said; and in all
      departments of knowledge, as experience proves, any one who has studied
      geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has not.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes indeed, he said, there is an infinite difference between them. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page230"></a>230</span>
</p>
<p>
      Then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our youth
      will study?
    </p>
<p>
      Let us do so, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage527D">D</a></span>
      And suppose we make astronomy the third—what do you say?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Astronomy, like the previous sciences, is at first praised by Glaucon for its practical uses.</span>
      I am strongly inclined to it, he said; the observation of the seasons and
      of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the farmer
      or sailor.
    </p>
<p>
      I am amused, I said, at your fear of the world, which makes you guard
      against the appearance of insisting upon useless studies; and I quite
      admit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye of the
      soul which, when by <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage527E">E</a></span>other pursuits lost and dimmed, is by these purified
      and re-illumined; and is more precious far than ten thousand bodily eyes,
      for by it alone is truth seen. Now there are two classes of persons: one
      class of those who will agree with you and will take your words as a
      revelation; another class <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage528A">528</a></span>to whom they will be utterly unmeaning, and who
      will naturally deem them to be idle tales, for they see no sort of profit
      which is to be obtained from them. And therefore you had better decide at
      once with which of the two you are proposing to argue. You will very
      likely say with neither, and that your chief aim in carrying on the
      argument is your own improvement; at the same time you do not grudge to
      others any benefit which they may receive.
    </p>
<p>
      I think that I should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my own
      behalf.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Correction of the order.</span>
      Then take a step backward, for we have gone wrong in the order of the
      sciences.
    </p>
<p>
      What was the mistake? he said.
    </p>
<p>
      After plane geometry, I said, we proceeded at once to <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage528B">B</a></span>solids in
      revolution, instead of taking solids in themselves; whereas after the
      second dimension the third, which is concerned with cubes and dimensions
      of depth, ought to have followed.
    </p>
<p>
      That is true, Socrates; but so little seems to be known as yet about these
      subjects.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The pitiable condition of solid geometry.</span>
      Why, yes, I said, and for two reasons:—in the first place, no
      government patronises them; this leads to a want of energy in the pursuit
      of them, and they are difficult; in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page231"></a>231</span> second place, students cannot
      learn them unless they have a director. But then a director can hardly be
      found, and even <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage528C">C</a></span>if he could, as matters now stand, the students, who are
      very conceited, would not attend to him. That, however, would be otherwise
      if the whole State became the director of these studies and gave honour to
      them; then disciples would want to come, and there would be continuous and
      earnest search, and discoveries would be made; since even now, disregarded
      as they are by the world, and maimed of their fair proportions, and
      although none of their votaries can tell the use of them, still these
      studies force their way by their natural charm, and very likely, if they
      had the help of the State, they would some day emerge into light.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage528D">D</a></span>
      Yes, he said, there is a remarkable charm in them. But I do not clearly
      understand the change in the order. First you began with a geometry of
      plane surfaces?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said.
    </p>
<p>
      And you placed astronomy next, and then you made a step backward?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The motion of solids.</span>
      Yes, and I have delayed you by my hurry; the ludicrous state of solid
      geometry, which, in natural order, should have followed, made me pass over
      this branch and go on to <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage528E">E</a></span>astronomy, or motion of solids.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence if
      encouraged by the State, let us go on to astronomy, which will be fourth.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Glaucon grows sentimental about astronomy.</span>
      The right order, he replied. And now, Socrates, as you rebuked the vulgar
      manner in which I praised astronomy <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage529A">529</a></span>before, my praise shall be given in
      your own spirit. For every one, as I think, must see that astronomy
      compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to another.
    </p>
<p>
      Every one but myself, I said; to every one else this may be clear, but not
      to me.
    </p>
<p>
      And what then would you say?
    </p>
<p>
      I should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy
      appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards.
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean? he asked. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page232"></a>232</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">He is rebuked by Socrates,</span>
      You, I replied, have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our
      knowledge of the things above. And I dare <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage529B">B</a></span>say that if a person were to
      throw his head back and study the fretted ceiling, you would still think
      that his mind was the percipient, and not his eyes. And you are very
      likely right, and I may be a simpleton: but, in my opinion, that knowledge
      only which is of being and of the unseen can make the soul look upwards,
      and whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks on the ground, seeking to
      learn some particular of sense, I would deny that he can learn, for
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage529C">C</a></span>nothing of that sort is matter of science; his soul is looking downwards,
      not upwards, whether his way to knowledge is by water or by land, whether
      he floats, or only lies on his back.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">who explains that the higher astronomy is an abstract science.</span>
      I acknowledge, he said, the justice of your rebuke. Still, I should like
      to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more conducive to
      that knowledge of which we are speaking?
    </p>
<p>
      I will tell you, I said: The starry heaven which we behold is wrought upon
      a visible ground, and therefore, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage529D">D</a></span>although the fairest and most perfect of
      visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far to the true
      motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which are relative to
      each other, and carry with them that which is contained in them, in the
      true number and in every true figure. Now, these are to be apprehended by
      reason and intelligence, but not by sight.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      The spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that
      higher knowledge; their beauty is like <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage529E">E</a></span>the beauty of figures or pictures
      excellently wrought by the hand of Daedalus, or some other great artist,
      which we may chance to behold; any geometrician who saw them would
      appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship, but he would never
      dream of thinking that in them he could find the true equal or the true
      double, or the truth of any <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage530A">530</a></span>other proportion.
    </p>
<p>
      No, he replied, such an idea would be ridiculous.
    </p>
<p>
      And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the
      movements of the stars? Will he not think that heaven and the things in
      heaven are framed by the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page233"></a>233</span> Creator of them in the most perfect manner? But
      he will never imagine that the proportions of night and day, or of both to
      the month, or of the month to the year, or of the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage530B">B</a></span>stars to these and to
      one another, and any other things that are material and visible can also
      be eternal and subject to no deviation—that would be absurd; and it
      is equally absurd to take so much pains in investigating their exact
      truth.
    </p>
<p>
      I quite agree, though I never thought of this before.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The real knowledge of astronomy or geometry is to be attained by the use of abstractions.</span>
      Then, I said, in astronomy, as in geometry, we should employ problems, and
      let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right way
      and so make the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage530C">C</a></span>natural gift of reason to be of any real use.
    </p>
<p>
      That, he said, is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said; and there are many other things which must also have a
      similar extension given to them, if our legislation is to be of any value.
      But can you tell me of any other suitable study?
    </p>
<p>
      No, he said, not without thinking.
    </p>
<p>
      Motion, I said, has many forms, and not one only; two of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage530D">D</a></span>them are obvious
      enough even to wits no better than ours; and there are others, as I
      imagine, which may be left to wiser persons.
    </p>
<p>
      But where are the two?
    </p>
<p>
      There is a second, I said, which is the counterpart of the one already
      named.
    </p>
<p>
      And what may that be?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">What astronomy is to the eye, harmonics are to the ear.</span>
      The second, I said, would seem relatively to the ears to be what the first
      is to the eyes; for I conceive that as the eyes are designed to look up at
      the stars, so are the ears to hear harmonious motions; and these are
      sister sciences—as the Pythagoreans say, and we, Glaucon, agree with
      them?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage530E">E</a></span>
      But this, I said, is a laborious study, and therefore we had better go and
      learn of them; and they will tell us whether there are any other
      applications of these sciences. At the same time, we must not lose sight
      of our own higher object.
    </p>
<p>
      What is that?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">They must be studied with a view to the good and not after the fashion of the empirics or even of the Pythagoreans.</span>
      There is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page234"></a>234</span> and which our
      pupils ought also to attain, and not to fall short of, as I was saying
      that they did in astronomy. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage531A">531</a></span>For in the science of harmony, as you probably
      know, the same thing happens. The teachers of harmony compare the sounds
      and consonances which are heard only, and their labour, like that of the
      astronomers, is in vain.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, by heaven! he said; and ’tis as good as a play to hear them talking
      about their condensed notes, as they call them; they put their ears close
      alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from their
      neighbour’s wall<a href="#Footnotebook75" id="FnAnchorbook75" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">5</span></a>—one set of them declaring that they distinguish an
      intermediate note and have found the least interval which should be the
      unit of measurement; the others insisting that the two sounds have passed
      into the same—either party setting <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage531B">B</a></span>their ears before their
      understanding.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook75"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook75" class="pginternal">5</a></span> Or, ‘close alongside of their neighbour’s instruments, as if to catch a sound from them.’</p></div>
<p>
      You mean, I said, those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and
      rack them on the pegs of the instrument: I might carry on the metaphor and
      speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives, and make
      accusations against the strings, both of backwardness and forwardness to
      sound; but this would be tedious, and therefore I will only say that these
      are not the men, and that I am referring to the Pythagoreans, of whom I
      was just now proposing to enquire about harmony. For they too are in
      error, like the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage531C">C</a></span>astronomers; they investigate the numbers of the harmonies
      which are heard, but they never attain to problems—that is to say,
      they never reach the natural harmonies of number, or reflect why some
      numbers are harmonious and others not.
    </p>
<p>
      That, he said, is a thing of more than mortal knowledge.
    </p>
<p>
      A thing, I replied, which I would rather call useful; that is, if sought
      after with a view to the beautiful and good; but if pursued in any other
      spirit, useless.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">All these studies must be correlated with one another.</span>
      Now, when all these studies reach the point of inter-communion <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage531D">D</a></span>and
      connection with one another, and come to be considered in their mutual
      affinities, then, I think, but not till then, will the pursuit of them
      have a value for our objects; otherwise there is no profit in them. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page235"></a>235</span>
</p>
<p>
      I suspect so; but you are speaking, Socrates, of a vast work.
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean? I said; the prelude or what? Do you not know that all
      this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn? For
      you surely would not <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage531E">E</a></span>regard the skilled mathematician as a dialectician?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Want of reasoning power in mathematicians.</span>
      Assuredly not, he said; I have hardly ever known a mathematician who was
      capable of reasoning.
    </p>
<p>
      But do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason will
      have the knowledge which we require of them?
    </p>
<p>
      Neither can this be supposed.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage532A">532</a></span> <span class="sidenote">Dialectic proceeds by reason only, without any help of sense.</span>
      And so, Glaucon, I said, we have at last arrived at the hymn of dialectic.
      This is that strain which is of the intellect only, but which the faculty
      of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate; for sight, as you may
      remember, was imagined by us after a while to behold the real animals and
      stars, and last of all the sun himself. And so with dialectic; when a
      person starts on the discovery of the absolute by the light of reason
      only, and without any assistance of sense, and perseveres <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage532B">B</a></span>until by pure
      intelligence he arrives at the perception of the absolute good, he at last
      finds himself at the end of the intellectual world, as in the case of
      sight at the end of the visible.
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then this is the progress which you call dialectic?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The gradual acquirement of dialectic by the pursuit of the arts anticipated in the allegory of the den.</span>
      But the release of the prisoners from chains, and their translation from
      the shadows to the images and to the light, and the ascent from the
      underground den to the sun, while in his presence they are vainly trying
      to look on animals and plants and the light of the sun, but are able to
      perceive <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage532C">C</a></span>even with their weak eyes the images<a href="#Footnotebook76" id="FnAnchorbook76" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">6</span></a> in the water (which are
      divine), and are the shadows of true existence (not shadows of images cast
      by a light of fire, which compared with the sun is only an image)—this
      power of elevating the highest principle in the soul to the contemplation
      of that which is best in existence, with which we may compare the raising
      of that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page236"></a>236</span> faculty which is the very light of the body to the sight of that
      which is brightest in the material and visible world—this power is
      given, as I was saying, by all that study and pursuit <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage532D">D</a></span>of the arts which
      has been described.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook76"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook76" class="pginternal">6</a></span> Omitting <span class="transl" title="e)ntau=tha de\ pro\s phanta/smata">ἐνταῦθα δὲ πρὸς φαντάσματα</span>. The word

<p>
      I agree in what you are saying, he replied, which may be hard to believe,
      yet, from another point of view, is harder still to deny. This, however,
      is not a theme to be treated of in passing only, but will have to be
      discussed again and again. And so, whether our conclusion be true or
      false, let us assume all this, and proceed at once from the prelude or
      preamble to the chief strain<a href="#Footnotebook77" id="FnAnchorbook77" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">7</span></a>, and describe that in like manner. Say, then, what is
      the nature and what are the divisions of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage532E">E</a></span>dialectic, and what are the paths
      which lead thither; for these paths will also lead to our final rest.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook77"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook77" class="pginternal">7</a></span> A play upon the word <span class="transl" title="no/mos">νόμος</span>, which means

<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage533A">533</a></span> <span class="sidenote">The nature of dialectic can only be revealed to those who have been students of the preliminary sciences,</span>
      Dear Glaucon, I said, you will not be able to follow me here, though I
      would do my best, and you should behold not an image only but the absolute
      truth, according to my notion. Whether what I told you would or would not
      have been a reality I cannot venture to say; but you would have seen
      something like reality; of that I am confident.
    </p>
<p>
      Doubtless, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      But I must also remind you, that the power of dialectic alone can reveal
      this, and only to one who is a disciple of the previous sciences.
    </p>
<p>
      Of that assertion you may be as confident as of the last.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage533B">B</a></span>
      And assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of
      comprehending by any regular process all true existence or of ascertaining
      what each thing is in its own nature; for the arts in general are
      concerned with the desires or opinions of men, or are cultivated with a
      view to production and construction, or for the preservation of such
      productions and constructions; and as to the mathematical sciences which,
      as we were saying, have some apprehension of true being—geometry and
      the like—they only dream about <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage533C">C</a></span>being, but never can they behold the
      waking reality so long as they leave the hypotheses which they use
      unexamined, and are unable to give an account of them. For when a man
      knows not his own first principle, and when the conclusion <span class="pagenum"><a id="page237"></a>237</span> and
      intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows not what, how can
      he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever become science?
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">which are her handmaids.</span>
      Then dialectic, and dialectic alone, goes directly to the first principle
      and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to make
      her ground secure; the eye of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage533D">D</a></span>the soul, which is literally buried in an
      outlandish slough, is by her gentle aid lifted upwards; and she uses as
      handmaids and helpers in the work of conversion, the sciences which we
      have been discussing. Custom terms them sciences, but they ought to have
      some other name, implying greater clearness than opinion and less
      clearness than science: and this, in our previous sketch, was called
      understanding. But why <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage533E">E</a></span>should we dispute about names when we have
      realities of such importance to consider?
    </p>
<p>
      Why indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought of
      the mind with clearness?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Two divisions of the mind, intellect and opinion, each having two subdivisions.</span>
      At any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions; two for
      intellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division science, the
      second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth perception of
      shadows, opinion <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage534A">534</a></span> being concerned with becoming, and intellect with being;
      and so to make a proportion:—
    </p>
<blockquote><div><p class="noind">
      As being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion.<br> And as intellect
      is to opinion, so is science to belief, and understanding to the
      perception of shadows.
    </p></div></blockquote>
<p>
      But let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the subjects
      of opinion and of intellect, for it will be a long enquiry, many times
      longer than this has been.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage534B">B</a></span>
      As far as I understand, he said, I agree.
    </p>
<p>
      And do you also agree, I said, in describing the dialectician as one who
      attains a conception of the essence of each thing? And he who does not
      possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in whatever
      degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence?
      Will you admit so much?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; how can I deny it?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">No truth which does not rest on the idea of good</span>
      And you would say the same of the conception of the good? Until the person
      is able to abstract and define rationally the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page238"></a>238</span> <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage534C">C</a></span>idea of good, and unless he
      can run the gauntlet of all objections, and is ready to disprove them, not
      by appeals to opinion, but to absolute truth, never faltering at any step
      of the argument—unless he can do all this, you would say that he
      knows neither the idea of good nor any other good; he apprehends only a
      shadow, if anything at all, which is given by opinion and not by science;—dreaming
      and slumbering in this life, before he is well awake here, he <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage534D">D</a></span>arrives at
      the world below, and has his final quietus.
    </p>
<p>
      In all that I should most certainly agree with you.
    </p>
<p>
      And surely you would not have the children of your ideal State, whom you
      are nurturing and educating—if the ideal ever becomes a reality—you
      would not allow the future rulers to be like posts<a href="#Footnotebook78" id="FnAnchorbook78" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">8</span></a>, having no reason in them,
      and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters?
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook78"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook78" class="pginternal">8</a></span> <span class="transl" title="gramma/s">γραμμάς</span>, literally ‘lines,’ probably the starting-point of a race-course.</p></div>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      Then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as will
      enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering
      questions?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage534E">E</a></span>
      Yes, he said, you and I together will make it.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">ought to have a high place.</span>
      Dialectic, then, as you will agree, is the coping-stone of the sciences,
      and is set over them; no other science can be <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage535A">535</a></span>placed higher—the
      nature of knowledge can no further go?
    </p>
<p>
      I agree, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      But to whom we are to assign these studies, and in what way they are to be
      assigned, are questions which remain to be considered.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      You remember, I said, how the rulers were chosen before?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      The same natures must still be chosen, and the preference again given to
      the surest and the bravest, and, if possible, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage535B">B</a></span>to the fairest; and, having
      noble and generous tempers, they should also have the natural gifts which
      will facilitate their education.
    </p>
<p>
      And what are these?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The natural gifts which are required in the dialectician: a towardly understanding; a good memory; strength of character;</span>
      Such gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition; for the mind more
      often faints from the severity of study <span class="pagenum"><a id="page239"></a>239</span> than from the severity of
      gymnastics: the toil is more entirely the mind’s own, and is not shared
      with the body.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage535C">C</a></span>
      Further, he of whom we are in search should have a good memory, and be an
      unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line; or he will never
      be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go through
      all the intellectual discipline and study which we require of him.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said; he must have natural gifts.
    </p>
<p>
      The mistake at present is, that those who study philosophy have no
      vocation, and this, as I was before saying, is the reason why she has
      fallen into disrepute: her true sons should take her by the hand and not
      bastards.
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage535D">D</a></span> <span class="sidenote">industry;</span>
      In the first place, her votary should not have a lame or halting industry—I
      mean, that he should not be half industrious and half idle: as, for
      example, when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting, and all other
      bodily exercises, but a hater rather than a lover of the labour of
      learning or listening or enquiring. Or the occupation to which he devotes
      himself may be of an opposite kind, and he may have the other sort of
      lameness.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">love of truth;</span>
      And as to truth, I said, is not a soul equally to be deemed <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage535E">E</a></span>halt and lame
      which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at herself and
      others when they tell lies, but is patient of involuntary falsehood, and
      does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the mire of ignorance, and
      has no shame at being detected?
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage536A">536</a></span> <span class="sidenote">the moral virtues.</span>
      And, again, in respect of temperance, courage, magnificence, and every
      other virtue, should we not carefully distinguish between the true son and
      the bastard? for where there is no discernment of such qualities states
      and individuals unconsciously err; and the state makes a ruler, and the
      individual a friend, of one who, being defective in some part of virtue,
      is in a figure lame or a bastard.
    </p>
<p>
      That is very true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      All these things, then, will have to be carefully considered <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage536B">B</a></span>by us; and if
      only those whom we introduce to this vast <span class="pagenum"><a id="page240"></a>240</span> system of education and training
      are sound in body and mind, justice herself will have nothing to say
      against us, and we shall be the saviours of the constitution and of the
      State; but, if our pupils are men of another stamp, the reverse will
      happen, and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule on philosophy
      than she has to endure at present.
    </p>
<p>
      That would not be creditable.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Socrates plays a little with himself and his subject.</span>
      Certainly not, I said; and yet perhaps, in thus turning jest into earnest
      I am equally ridiculous.
    </p>
<p>
      In what respect?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage536C">C</a></span>
      I had forgotten, I said, that we were not serious, and spoke with too much
      excitement. For when I saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled under foot
      of men I could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the authors of
      her disgrace: and my anger made me too vehement.
    </p>
<p>
      Indeed! I was listening, and did not think so.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">For the study of dialectic the young must be selected.</span>
      But I, who am the speaker, felt that I was. And now let me remind you
      that, although in our former selection we <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage536D">D</a></span>chose old men, we must not do so
      in this. Solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when he grows
      old may learn many things—for he can no more learn much than he can
      run much; youth is the time for any extraordinary toil.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The preliminary studies should be commenced in childhood, but never forced.</span>
      And, therefore, calculation and geometry and all the other elements of
      instruction, which are a preparation for dialectic, should be presented to
      the mind in childhood; not, however, under any notion of forcing our
      system of education.
    </p>
<p>
      Why not?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage536E">E</a></span>
      Because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of knowledge
      of any kind. Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm to the body;
      but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the
      mind.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, my good friend, I said, do not use compulsion, but <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage537A">537</a></span>let early
      education be a sort of amusement; you will then be better able to find out
      the natural bent.
    </p>
<p>
      That is a very rational notion, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Do you remember that the children, too, were to be taken <span class="pagenum"><a id="page241"></a>241</span> to see the battle
      on horseback; and that if there were no danger they were to be brought
      close up and, like young hounds, have a taste of blood given them?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I remember.
    </p>
<p>
      The same practice may be followed, I said, in all these things—labours,
      lessons, dangers—and he who is most at home in all of them ought to
      be enrolled in a select number.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage537B">B</a></span>
      At what age?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The necessary gymnastics must be completed first.</span>
      At the age when the necessary gymnastics are over: the period whether of
      two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless for
      any other purpose; for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to learning;
      and the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is one of the most
      important tests to which our youth are subjected.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">At twenty years of age the disciples will begin to be taught the correlation of the sciences.</span>
      After that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years old
      will be promoted to higher honour, and the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage537C">C</a></span>sciences which they learned
      without any order in their early education will now be brought together,
      and they will be able to see the natural relationship of them to one
      another and to true being.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting root.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said; and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion of
      dialectical talent: the comprehensive mind is always the dialectical.
    </p>
<p>
      I agree with you, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">At thirty the most promising will be placed in a select class.</span>
      These, I said, are the points which you must consider; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage537D">D</a></span>and those who have
      most of this comprehension, and who are most steadfast in their learning,
      and in their military and other appointed duties, when they have arrived
      at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of the select class, and
      elevated to higher honour; and you will have to prove them by the help of
      dialectic, in order to learn which of them is able to give up the use of
      sight and the other senses, and in company with truth to attain absolute
      being: And here, my friend, great caution is required.
    </p>
<p>
      Why great caution?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage537E">E</a></span> <span class="sidenote">The growth of scepticism</span>
      Do you not remark, I said, how great is the evil which dialectic has
      introduced? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page242"></a>242</span>
</p>
<p>
      What evil? he said.
    </p>
<p>
      The students of the art are filled with lawlessness.
    </p>
<p>
      Quite true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in
      their case? or will you make allowance for them?
    </p>
<p>
      In what way make allowance?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">in the minds of the young illustrated by the case of a supposititious son,</span>
      I want you, I said, by way of parallel, to imagine a supposititious son
      who is brought up in great wealth; he <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage538A">538</a></span>is one of a great and numerous
      family, and has many flatterers. When he grows up to manhood, he learns
      that his alleged are not his real parents; but who the real are he is
      unable to discover. Can you guess how he will be likely to behave towards
      his flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all during the period
      when he is ignorant of the false relation, and then again when he knows?
      Or shall I guess for you?
    </p>
<p>
      If you please.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">who ceases to honour his father when he discovers that he is not his father.</span>
      Then I should say, that while he is ignorant of the truth <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage538B">B</a></span>he will be
      likely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations more
      than the flatterers; he will be less inclined to neglect them when in
      need, or to do or say anything against them; and he will be less willing
      to disobey them in any important matter.
    </p>
<p>
      He will.
    </p>
<p>
      But when he has made the discovery, I should imagine that he would
      diminish his honour and regard for them, and would become more devoted to
      the flatterers; their influence over him would greatly increase; he would
      now live after <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage538C">C</a></span>their ways, and openly associate with them, and, unless he
      were of an unusually good disposition, he would trouble himself no more
      about his supposed parents or other relations.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, all that is very probable. But how is the image applicable to the
      disciples of philosophy?
    </p>
<p>
      In this way: you know that there are certain principles about justice and
      honour, which were taught us in childhood, and under their parental
      authority we have been brought up, obeying and honouring them.
    </p>
<p>
      That is true.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage538D">D</a></span>
      There are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure <span class="pagenum"><a id="page243"></a>243</span> which flatter and
      attract the soul, but do not influence those of us who have any sense of
      right, and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their fathers.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">So men who begin to analyse the first principles of morality cease to respect them.</span>
      Now, when a man is in this state, and the questioning spirit asks what is
      fair or honourable, and he answers as the legislator has taught him, and
      then arguments many and diverse refute his words, until he is driven into
      believing that nothing is honourable any more than dishonourable, or <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage538E">E</a></span>just
      and good any more than the reverse, and so of all the notions which he
      most valued, do you think that he will still honour and obey them as
      before?
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      And when he ceases to think them honourable and natural <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage539A">539</a></span>as heretofore, and
      he fails to discover the true, can he be expected to pursue any life other
      than that which flatters his desires?
    </p>
<p>
      He cannot.
    </p>
<p>
      And from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of it?
    </p>
<p>
      Unquestionably.
    </p>
<p>
      Now all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as I have
      described, and also, as I was just now saying, most excusable.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; and, I may add, pitiable.
    </p>
<p>
      Therefore, that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our citizens
      who are now thirty years of age, every care must be taken in introducing
      them to dialectic.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage539B">B</a></span> <span class="sidenote">Young men are fond of pulling truth to pieces and thus bring disgrace upon themselves and upon philosophy.</span>
      There is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early; for
      youngsters, as you may have observed, when they first get the taste in
      their mouths, argue for amusement, and are always contradicting and
      refuting others in imitation of those who refute them; like puppy-dogs,
      they rejoice in pulling and tearing at all who come near them.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, there is nothing which they like better.
    </p>
<p>
      And when they have made many conquests and received <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage539C">C</a></span>defeats at the hands
      of many, they violently and speedily get into a way of not believing
      anything which they believed before, and hence, not only they, but
      philosophy and all that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page244"></a>244</span> relates to it is apt to have a bad name with the
      rest of the world.
    </p>
<p>
      Too true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The dialectician and the eristic.</span>
      But when a man begins to get older, he will no longer be guilty of such
      insanity; he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth, and
      not the eristic, who is contradicting for the sake of amusement; and the
      greater moderation of his <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage539D">D</a></span>character will increase instead of diminishing
      the honour of the pursuit.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And did we not make special provision for this, when we said that the
      disciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast, not, as now, any
      chance aspirant or intruder?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      Suppose, I said, the study of philosophy to take the place of gymnastics
      and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively for twice the
      number of years which were passed in bodily exercise—will that be
      enough?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage539E">E</a></span>
      Would you say six or four years? he asked.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The study of philosophy to continue for five years; 30–35.</span>
      Say five years, I replied; at the end of the time they must be sent down
      again into the den and compelled to hold any military or other office
      which young men are qualified to hold: in this way they will get their
      experience of life, and there will be an opportunity of trying whether,
      when they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation, they will stand firm
      or flinch.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage540A">540</a></span>
      And how long is this stage of their lives to last?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">During fifteen years, 35–50, they are to hold office.</span>
      Fifteen years, I answered; and when they have reached fifty years of age,
      then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves in
      every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at last
      to their consummation: the time has now arrived at which they must raise
      the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens all things, and
      behold the absolute good; for that is the pattern according to which they
      are to order the State and the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage540B">B</a></span>lives of individuals, and the remainder of
      their own lives also; making philosophy their chief pursuit, <span class="sidenote">At the end of that time they are to live chiefly in the contemplation of the good, but occasionally to return to politics.</span>but, when
      their turn comes, toiling also at politics and ruling for the public good,
      not as though they were performing some heroic <span class="pagenum"><a id="page245"></a>245</span> action, but simply as a
      matter of duty; and when they have brought up in each generation others
      like themselves and left them in their place to be governors of the State,
      then they will depart to the Islands of the Blest and dwell there; and the
      city will give them public memorials and sacrifices <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage540C">C</a></span>and honour them, if
      the Pythian oracle consent, as demigods, but if not, as in any case
      blessed and divine.
    </p>
<p>
      You are a sculptor, Socrates, and have made statues of our governors
      faultless in beauty.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, Glaucon, and of our governesses too; for you must not suppose
      that what I have been saying applies to men only and not to women as far
      as their natures can go.
    </p>
<p>
      There you are right, he said, since we have made them to share in all
      things like the men.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage540D">D</a></span>
      Well, I said, and you would agree (would you not?) that what has been said
      about the State and the government is not a mere dream, and although
      difficult not impossible, but only possible in the way which has been
      supposed; that is to say, when the true philosopher kings are born in a
      State, one or more of them, despising the honours of this present world
      which they deem mean and worthless, esteeming above all things right and
      the honour <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage540E">E</a></span>that springs from right, and regarding justice as the greatest
      and most necessary of all things, whose ministers they are, and whose
      principles will be exalted by them when they set in order their own city?
    </p>
<p>
      How will they proceed?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Practical measures for the speedy foundation of the State.</span>
      They will begin by sending out into the country all the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage541A">541</a></span>inhabitants of the
      city who are more than ten years old, and will take possession of their
      children, who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents; these
      they will train in their own habits and laws, I mean in the laws which we
      have given them: and in this way the State and constitution of which we
      were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness, and the
      nation which has such a constitution will gain most.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, that will be the best way. And I think, Socrates, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage541B">B</a></span>that you have very
      well described how, if ever, such a constitution might come into being. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page246"></a>246</span>
</p>
<p>
      Enough then of the perfect State, and of the man who bears its image—there
      is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him.
    </p>
<p>
      There is no difficulty, he replied; and I agree with you in thinking that
      nothing more need be said.

      A<span class="smcap">ND</span> so, Glaucon, we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect
      State wives and children are to be in common; and that all education and
      the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common, and the best
      philosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings?
    </p>
<p>
      That, replied Glaucon, has been acknowledged.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage543B">B</a></span>
      Yes, I said; and we have further acknowledged that the governors, when
      appointed themselves, will take their soldiers and place them in houses
      such as we were describing, which are common to all, and contain nothing
      private, or individual; and about their property, you remember what we
      agreed?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions of
      mankind; they were to be warrior <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage543C">C</a></span>athletes and guardians, receiving from
      the other citizens, in lieu of annual payment, only their maintenance, and
      they were to take care of themselves and of the whole State.
    </p>
<p>
      True, I said; and now that this division of our task is concluded, let us
      find the point at which we digressed, that we may return into the old
      path.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Return to the end of Book IV.</span>
      There is no difficulty in returning; you implied, then as now, that you
      had finished the description of the State: you said that such a State was
      good, and that the man was good <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage543D">D</a></span>who answered to it, although, as now
      appears, you had more <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage544A">544</a></span>excellent things to relate both of State and man.
      And you said further, that if this was the true form, then the others were
      false; and of the false forms, you said, as I remember, that there were
      four principal ones, and that their defects, and the defects of the
      individuals corresponding to them, were worth examining. When we had seen
      all the individuals, and finally agreed as to who was the best and who was
      the worst <span class="pagenum"><a id="page248"></a>248</span> of them, we were to consider whether the best was not also the
      happiest, and the worst the most miserable. I asked you what were the four
      forms of government of which <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage544B">B</a></span>you spoke, and then Polemarchus and
      Adeimantus put in their word; and you began again, and have found your way
      to the point at which we have now arrived.
    </p>
<p>
      Your recollection, I said, is most exact.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, like a wrestler, he replied, you must put yourself again in the same
      position; and let me ask the same questions, and do you give me the same
      answer which you were about to give me then.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, if I can, I will, I said.
    </p>
<p>
      I shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions of
      which you were speaking.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage544C">C</a></span> <span class="sidenote">Four imperfect constitutions, the Cretan or Spartan, Oligarchy, Democracy, Tyranny.</span>
      That question, I said, is easily answered: the four governments of which I
      spoke, so far as they have distinct names, are, first, those of Crete and
      Sparta, which are generally applauded; what is termed oligarchy comes
      next; this is not equally approved, and is a form of government which
      teems with evils: thirdly, democracy, which naturally follows oligarchy,
      although very different: and lastly comes tyranny, great and famous, which
      differs from them all, and is the fourth and worst disorder of a State. I
      do not know, do you? of any other constitution which can be said to have a
      distinct character. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage544D">D</a></span> There are lordships and principalities which are
      bought and sold, and some other intermediate forms of government. But
      these are nondescripts and may be found equally among Hellenes and among
      barbarians.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he replied, we certainly hear of many curious forms of government
      which exist among them.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">States are like men, because they are made up of men.</span>
      Do you know, I said, that governments vary as the dispositions of men
      vary, and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the other?
      For we cannot suppose that States are made of ‘oak and rock,’ and not out
      of the human natures which are in them, and which in a figure <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage544E">E</a></span>turn the
      scale and draw other things after them?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, the States are as the men are; they grow out of human
      characters.
    </p>
<p>
      Then if the constitutions of States are five, the dispositions of
      individual minds will also be five? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page249"></a>249</span>
</p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Him who answers to aristocracy, and whom we rightly <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage545A">545</a></span>call just and good, we
      have already described.
    </p>
<p>
      We have.
    </p>
<p>
      Then let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures, being
      the contentious and ambitious, who answer to the Spartan polity; also the
      oligarchical, democratical, and tyrannical. Let us place the most just by
      the side of the most unjust, and when we see them we shall be able to
      compare the relative happiness or unhappiness of him who leads a life of
      pure justice or pure injustice. The enquiry will then be completed. And we
      shall know whether we ought to pursue injustice, as Thrasymachus advises,
      or <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage545B">B</a></span>in accordance with the conclusions of the argument to prefer justice.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he replied, we must do as you say.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The State and the individual.</span>
      Shall we follow our old plan, which we adopted with a view to clearness,
      of taking the State first and then proceeding to the individual, and begin
      with the government of honour?—I know of no name for such a
      government other than timocracy, or perhaps timarchy. We will compare with
      this the like character in the individual; and, after that, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage545C">C</a></span>consider
      oligarchy and the oligarchical man; and then again we will turn our
      attention to democracy and the democratical man; and lastly, we will go
      and view the city of tyranny, and once more take a look into the tyrant’s
      soul, and try to arrive at a satisfactory decision.
    </p>
<p>
      That way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very suitable.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">How timocracy arises out of aristocracy.</span>
      First, then, I said, let us enquire how timocracy (the government of
      honour) arises out of aristocracy (the government <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage545D">D</a></span>of the best). Clearly,
      all political changes originate in divisions of the actual governing
      power; a government which is united, however small, cannot be moved.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      In what way, then, will our city be moved, and in what manner will the two
      classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with one
      another? Shall we, after the manner of Homer, pray the Muses to tell us
      ‘how discord <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage545E">E</a></span>first arose’? Shall we imagine them in solemn <span class="pagenum"><a id="page250"></a>250</span> mockery, to
      play and jest with us as if we were children, and to address us in a lofty
      tragic vein, making believe to be in earnest?
    </p>
<p>
      How would they address us?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage546A">546</a></span>
      After this manner:—A city which is thus constituted can hardly be
      shaken; but, seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an end,
      even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever, but will in time
      be dissolved. And this is the dissolution:—In plants that grow in
      the earth, as well as in animals that move on the earth’s surface,
      fertility and sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences of
      the circles of each are completed, which in short-lived existences pass
      over a short space, and in long-lived ones over a long space. <span class="sidenote">The intelligence
which is alloyed with sense will not know how to regulate births and
deaths in accordance with the number which controls them.</span>But to the
      knowledge of human fecundity and sterility all the wisdom and education of
      your rulers will not attain; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage546B">B</a></span>the laws which regulate them will not be
      discovered by an intelligence which is alloyed with sense, but will escape
      them, and they will bring children into the world when they ought not. Now
      that which is of divine birth has a period which is contained in a perfect
      number,<a href="#Footnotebook81" id="FnAnchorbook81" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">1</span></a> but the period of human birth is comprehended in a number in
      which first increments by involution and evolution [<i>or</i> squared and cubed]
      obtaining three intervals and four terms of like and unlike, waxing and
      waning numbers, make all the terms <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage546C">C</a></span>commensurable and agreeable to one
      another.<a href="#Footnotebook82" id="FnAnchorbook82" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The base of these (3)
      with a third added (4) when combined with five (20) and raised to the
      third power furnishes two harmonies; the first a square which is a hundred
      times as great (400 = 4 × 100),<a href="#Footnotebook83" id="FnAnchorbook83" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">3</span></a> and the other a figure having one side equal to the
      former, but oblong,<a href="#Footnotebook84" id="FnAnchorbook84" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">4</span></a> consisting of a hundred numbers squared upon rational
      diameters of a square (i.e. omitting fractions), the side of which is five
      (7 × 7 = 49 × 100 = 4900), each of them <span class="pagenum"><a id="page251"></a>251</span> being less by one (than the
      perfect square which includes the fractions, sc. 50) or less by<a href="#Footnotebook85" id="FnAnchorbook85" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">5</span></a> two perfect
      squares of irrational diameters (of a square the side of which is five =
      50 + 50 = 100); and a hundred cubes of three (27 × 100 = 2700 + 4900 + 400
      = 8000). Now this number represents a geometrical figure which has control
      over <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage546D">D</a></span>the good and evil of births. For when your guardians are ignorant of
      the law of births, and unite bride and bridegroom out of season, the
      children will not be goodly or fortunate. And though only the best of them
      will be appointed by their predecessors, still they will be unworthy to
      hold their fathers’ places, and when they come into power as guardians,
      they will soon be found to fail in taking care of us, the Muses, first by
      under-valuing music; which neglect will soon extend to gymnastic; and
      hence the young men of your State will be less cultivated. In the
      succeeding generation rulers will be appointed who have lost the guardian
      power of testing the metal of your <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage546E">E</a></span>different races, which, like Hesiod’s,
      are of gold and silver <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage547A">547</a></span>and brass and iron. And so iron will be mingled
      with silver, and brass with gold, and hence there will arise dissimilarity
      and inequality and irregularity, which always and in all places are causes
      of hatred and war. This the Muses affirm to be the stock from which
      discord has sprung, wherever arising; and this is their answer to us.

<p>
      Yes, and we may assume that they answer truly.
    </p>
<p>
      Why, yes, I said, of course they answer truly; how can the Muses speak
      falsely?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage547B">B</a></span>
      And what do the Muses say next?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Then discord arose and individual took the place of common property.</span>
      When discord arose, then the two races were drawn different ways: the iron
      and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and silver;
      but the gold and silver races, not wanting money but having the true
      riches in their own nature, inclined towards virtue and the ancient order
      of things. There was a battle between them, and at last they agreed to
      distribute their land and houses among <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage547C">C</a></span>individual owners; and they
      enslaved their friends and maintainers, whom they had formerly protected
      in the condition of freemen, and made of them subjects and servants; and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page252"></a>252</span>
      they themselves were engaged in war and in keeping a watch against them.
    </p>
<p>
      I believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the change.
    </p>
<p>
      And the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate
      between oligarchy and aristocracy?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      Such will be the change, and after the change has been made, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage547D">D</a></span>how will they
      proceed? Clearly, the new State, being in a mean between oligarchy and the
      perfect State, will partly follow one and partly the other, and will also
      have some peculiarities.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      In the honour given to rulers, in the abstinence of the warrior class from
      agriculture, handicrafts, and trade in general, in the institution of
      common meals, and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military
      training—in all these respects this State will resemble the former.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage547E">E</a></span> <span class="sidenote">Timocracy will retain the military and reject the philosophical character of the perfect State.</span>
      But in the fear of admitting philosophers to power, because they are no
      longer to be had simple and earnest, but are made up of mixed elements;
      and in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters, who
      are by nature <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage548A">548</a></span>fitted for war rather than peace; and in the value set by
      them upon military stratagems and contrivances, and in the waging of
      everlasting wars—this State will be for the most part peculiar.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The soldier class miserly and covetous.</span>
      Yes, I said; and men of this stamp will be covetous of money, like those
      who live in oligarchies; they will have, a fierce secret longing after
      gold and silver, which they will hoard in dark places, having magazines
      and treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment of them; also
      castles which are just nests for their eggs, and in which they <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage548B">B</a></span>will spend
      large sums on their wives, or on any others whom they please.
    </p>
<p>
      That is most true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring the
      money which they prize; they will spend that which is another man’s on the
      gratification of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page253"></a>253</span> their desires, stealing their pleasures and running away
      like children from the law, their father: they have been schooled not by
      gentle influences but by force, for they have neglected her who is the
      true Muse, the companion of reason and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage548C">C</a></span>philosophy, and have honoured
      gymnastic more than music.
    </p>
<p>
      Undoubtedly, he said, the form of government which you describe is a
      mixture of good and evil.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The spirit of ambition predominates in such States.</span>
      Why, there is a mixture, I said; but one thing, and one thing only, is
      predominantly seen,—the spirit of contention and ambition; and these
      are due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element.
    </p>
<p>
      Assuredly, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Such is the origin and such the character of this State, which has been
      described in outline only; the more perfect <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage548D">D</a></span>execution was not required,
      for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and
      most perfectly unjust; and to go through all the States and all the
      characters of men, omitting none of them, would be an interminable labour.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, A<span class="smcap">DEIMANTUS</span>.<br>The timocratic
man, uncultured, but fond of culture, ambitious, contentious, rough with
 slaves, and courteous to freemen; a soldier, athlete, hunter; a
despiser of riches while young, fond of them when he grows old.</span>
      Now what man answers to this form of government—how did he come into
      being, and what is he like?
    </p>
<p>
      I think, said Adeimantus, that in the spirit of contention which
      characterises him, he is not unlike our friend Glaucon.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage548E">E</a></span>
      Perhaps, I said, he may be like him in that one point; but there are other
      respects in which he is very different.
    </p>
<p>
      In what respects?
    </p>
<p>
      He should have more of self-assertion and be less cultivated, and yet a
      friend of culture; and he should be a good <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage549A">549</a></span>listener, but no speaker. Such
      a person is apt to be rough with slaves, unlike the educated man, who is
      too proud for that; and he will also be courteous to freemen, and
      remarkably obedient to authority; he is a lover of power and a lover of
      honour; claiming to be a ruler, not because he is eloquent, or on any
      ground of that sort, but because he is a soldier and has performed feats
      of arms; he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises and of the chase.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, that is the type of character which answers to timocracy.
    </p>
<p>
      Such an one will despise riches only when he is young; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page254"></a>254</span> <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage549B">B</a></span>but as he gets
      older he will be more and more attracted to them, because he has a piece
      of the avaricious nature in him, and is not single-minded towards virtue,
      having lost his best guardian.
    </p>
<p>
      Who was that? said Adeimantus.
    </p>
<p>
      Philosophy, I said, tempered with music, who comes and takes up her abode
      in a man, and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life.
    </p>
<p>
      Good, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Such, I said, is the timocratical youth, and he is like the timocratical
      State.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage549C">C</a></span>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p>
      His origin is as follows:—He is often the young son of a brave
      father, who dwells in an ill-governed city, of which he declines the
      honours and offices, and will not go to law, or exert himself in any way,
      but is ready to waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble.
    </p>
<p>
      And how does the son come into being?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The timocratic man often originates in a reaction against his father’s character, which is encouraged by his mother,</span>
      The character of the son begins to develope when he hears his mother
      complaining that her husband has no place in the government, of which the
      consequence is that she has <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage549D">D</a></span>no precedence among other women. Further, when
      she sees her husband not very eager about money, and instead of battling
      and railing in the law courts or assembly, taking whatever happens to him
      quietly; and when she observes that his thoughts always centre in himself,
      while he treats her with very considerable indifference, she is annoyed,
      and says to her son that his father is only half a man and far too
      easy-going: adding all the other complaints about her own <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage549E">E</a></span>ill-treatment
      which women are so fond of rehearsing.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, said Adeimantus, they give us plenty of them, and their complaints
      are so like themselves.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">and by the old servants of the household.</span>
      And you know, I said, that the old servants also, who are supposed to be
      attached to the family, from time to time talk privately in the same
      strain to the son; and if they see any one who owes money to his father,
      or is wronging him in any way, and he fails to prosecute them, they tell
      the youth that <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage550A">550</a></span>when he grows up he must retaliate upon people of this
      sort, and be more of a man than his father. He has only to walk abroad and
      he hears and sees the same sort of thing: those <span class="pagenum"><a id="page255"></a>255</span> who do their own business
      in the city are called simpletons, and held in no esteem, while the
      busy-bodies are honoured and applauded. The result is that the young man,
      hearing and seeing all these things—hearing, too, the words of his
      father, and having a nearer view of his way of life, and making
      comparisons of him and others—is drawn opposite ways: <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage550B">B</a></span>while his
      father is watering and nourishing the rational principle in his soul, the
      others are encouraging the passionate and appetitive; and he being not
      originally of a bad nature, but having kept bad company, is at last
      brought by their joint influence to a middle point, and gives up the
      kingdom which is within him to the middle principle of contentiousness and
      passion, and becomes arrogant and ambitious.
    </p>
<p>
      You seem to me to have described his origin perfectly.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage550C">C</a></span>
      Then we have now, I said, the second form of government and the second
      type of character?
    </p>
<p>
      We have.
    </p>
<p>
      Next, let us look at another man who, as Aeschylus says,
    </p>
<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="noind">
      ‘Is set over against another State;’
   </p></div></div>
<p class="noind">
      or rather, as our plan requires, begin with the State.
    </p>
<p>
      By all means.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Oligarchy</span>
      I believe that oligarchy follows next in order.
    </p>
<p>
      And what manner of government do you term oligarchy?
    </p>
<p>
      A government resting on a valuation of property, in which <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage550D">D</a></span> the rich have
      power and the poor man is deprived of it.
    </p>
<p>
      I understand, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Ought I not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to
      oligarchy arises?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, I said, no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes into
      the other.
    </p>
<p>
      How?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">arises out of increased accumulation and increased expenditure among the citizens.</span>
      The accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is the
      ruin of timocracy; they invent illegal modes of expenditure; for what do
      they or their wives care about the law?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, indeed.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage550E">E</a></span>
      And then one, seeing another grow rich, seeks to rival <span class="pagenum"><a id="page256"></a>256</span> him, and thus the
      great mass of the citizens become lovers of money.
    </p>
<p>
      Likely enough.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">As riches increase, virtue decreases: the one is honoured, the other despised; the one cultivated, the other neglected.</span>
      And so they grow richer and richer, and the more they think of making a
      fortune the less they think of virtue; for when riches and virtue are
      placed together in the scales of the balance, the one always rises as the
      other falls.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage551A">551</a></span>
      And in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the State, virtue
      and the virtuous are dishonoured.
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      And what is honoured is cultivated, and that which has no honour is
      neglected.
    </p>
<p>
      That is obvious.
    </p>
<p>
      And so at last, instead of loving contention and glory, men become lovers
      of trade and money; they honour and look up to the rich man, and make a
      ruler of him, and dishonour the poor man.
    </p>
<p>
      They do so.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">In an oligarchy a money qualification is established.</span>
      They next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage551B">B</a></span>of money as the
      qualification of citizenship; the sum is higher in one place and lower in
      another, as the oligarchy is more or less exclusive; and they allow no one
      whose property falls below the amount fixed to have any share in the
      government. These changes in the constitution they effect by force of
      arms, if intimidation has not already done their work.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And this, speaking generally, is the way in which oligarchy is
      established.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; but what are the characteristics of this form <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage551C">C</a></span>of government,
      and what are the defects of which we were speaking<a href="#Footnotebook86" id="FnAnchorbook86" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">6</span></a>?
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook86"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook86" class="pginternal">6</a></span> Cp. supra, <a href="#stpage544C" class="pginternal">544 C</a>.</p></div>
<p><span class="sidenote">A ruler is elected because he is rich: Who would elect a pilot on this principle?</span>
      First of all, I said, consider the nature of the qualification. Just think
      what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their property,
      and a poor man were refused permission to steer, even though he were a
      better pilot?
    </p>
<p>
      You mean that they would shipwreck?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes; and is not this true of the government of anything<a href="#Footnotebook87" id="FnAnchorbook87" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">7</span></a>? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page257"></a>257</span>
</p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook87"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook87" class="pginternal">7</a></span> Omitting <span class="transl" title="ê)/ tinos">ἤ τινος</span>.</p></div>
<p>
      I should imagine so.
    </p>
<p>
      Except a city?—or would you include a city?
    </p>
<p>
      Nay, he said, the case of a city is the strongest of all, inasmuch as the
      rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage551D">D</a></span>
      This, then, will be the first great defect of oligarchy?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      And here is another defect which is quite as bad.
    </p>
<p>
      What defect?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The extreme division of classes in such a State.</span>
      The inevitable division: such a State is not one, but two States, the one
      of poor, the other of rich men; and they are living on the same spot and
      always conspiring against one another.
    </p>
<p>
      That, surely, is at least as bad.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">They dare not go to war.</span>
      Another discreditable feature is, that, for a like reason, they are
      incapable of carrying on any war. Either they arm <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage551E">E</a></span>the multitude, and then
      they are more afraid of them than of the enemy; or, if they do not call
      them out in the hour of battle, they are oligarchs indeed, few to fight as
      they are few to rule. And at the same time their fondness for money makes
      them unwilling to pay taxes.
    </p>
<p>
      How discreditable!
    </p>
<p>
      And, as we said before, under such a constitution the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage552A">552</a></span>same persons have
      too many callings—they are husbandmen, tradesmen, warriors, all in
      one. Does that look well?
    </p>
<p>
      Anything but well.
    </p>
<p>
      There is another evil which is, perhaps, the greatest of all, and to which
      this State first begins to be liable.
    </p>
<p>
      What evil?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The ruined man, who has no occupation, once a spendthrift, now a pauper, still exists in the State.</span>
      A man may sell all that he has, and another may acquire his property; yet
      after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a part,
      being neither trader, nor artisan, nor horseman, nor hoplite, but only a
      poor, helpless creature.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage552B">B</a></span>
      Yes, that is an evil which also first begins in this State.
    </p>
<p>
      The evil is certainly not prevented there; for oligarchies have both the
      extremes of great wealth and utter poverty.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      But think again: In his wealthy days, while he was spending his money, was
      a man of this sort a whit more good to the State for the purposes of
      citizenship? Or <span class="pagenum"><a id="page258"></a>258</span> did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body,
      although in truth he was neither ruler nor subject, but just a
      spendthrift?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage552C">C</a></span>
      As you say, he seemed to be a ruler, but was only a spendthrift.
    </p>
<p>
      May we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the drone
      in the honeycomb, and that the one is the plague of the city as the other
      is of the hive?
    </p>
<p>
      Just so, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      And God has made the flying drones, Adeimantus, all without stings,
      whereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but others
      have dreadful stings; of the stingless class are those who in their old
      age end as paupers; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage552D">D</a></span>of the stingers come all the criminal class, as they
      are termed.
    </p>
<p>
      Most true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Where there are paupers, there are thieves</span>
      Clearly then, whenever you see paupers in a State, somewhere in that
      neighbourhood there are hidden away thieves, and cut-purses and robbers of
      temples, and all sorts of malefactors.
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, I said, and in oligarchical States do you not find paupers?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage552E">E</a></span> <span class="sidenote">and other criminals.</span>
      And may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to
      be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities are
      careful to restrain by force?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, we may be so bold.
    </p>
<p>
      The existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education,
      ill-training, and an evil constitution of the State?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      Such, then, is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy; and there may
      be many other evils.
    </p>
<p>
      Very likely.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage553A">553</a></span>
      Then oligarchy, or the form of government in which the rulers are elected
      for their wealth, may now be dismissed. Let us next proceed to consider
      the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this State. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page259"></a>259</span>
</p>
<p>
      By all means.
    </p>
<p>
      Does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise?
    </p>
<p>
      How?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The ruin of the timocratical man gives birth to the oligarchical.</span>
      A time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son: at first he
      begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps, but presently
      he sees him of a sudden <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage553B">B</a></span>foundering against the State as upon a sunken
      reef, and he and all that he has is lost; he may have been a general or
      some other high officer who is brought to trial under a prejudice raised
      by informers, and either put to death, or exiled, or deprived of the
      privileges of a citizen, and all his property taken from him.
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing more likely.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">His son begins life a ruined man and takes to money-making.</span>
      And the son has seen and known all this—he is a ruined man, and his
      fear has taught him to knock ambition and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage553C">C</a></span>passion headforemost from his
      bosom’s throne; humbled by poverty he takes to money-making and by mean
      and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together. Is not such an
      one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the vacant
      throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him, girt with tiara
      and chain and scimitar?
    </p>
<p>
      Most true, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage553D">D</a></span>
      And when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obediently
      on either side of their sovereign, and taught them to know their place, he
      compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned into larger
      ones, and will not allow the other to worship and admire anything but
      riches and rich men, or to be ambitious of anything so much as the
      acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it.
    </p>
<p>
      Of all changes, he said, there is none so speedy or so sure as the
      conversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage553E">E</a></span>
      And the avaricious, I said, is the oligarchical youth?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The oligarchical man and State resemble one another in their estimation of wealth: In their toiling and saving ways, in their want of cultivation.</span>
      Yes, he said; at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like the
      State out of which oligarchy came.
    </p>
<p>
      Let us then consider whether there is any likeness between them.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage554A">554</a></span>
      Very good.
    </p>
<p>
      First, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set upon
      wealth? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page260"></a>260</span>
</p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Also in their penurious, laborious character; the individual only
      satisfies his necessary appetites, and confines his expenditure to them;
      his other desires he subdues, under the idea that they are unprofitable.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      He is a shabby fellow, who saves something out of everything and makes a
      purse for himself; and this is the sort of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage554B">B</a></span>man whom the vulgar applaud. Is
      he not a true image of the State which he represents?
    </p>
<p>
      He appears to me to be so; at any rate money is highly valued by him as
      well as by the State.
    </p>
<p>
      You see that he is not a man of cultivation, I said.
    </p>
<p>
      I imagine not, he said; had he been educated he would never have made a
      blind god director of his chorus, or given him chief honour<a href="#Footnotebook88" id="FnAnchorbook88" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">8</span></a>.
    </p>

<p>
      Excellent! I said. Yet consider: Must we not further admit that owing to
      this want of cultivation there will be <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage554C">C</a></span>found in him dronelike desires as
      of pauper and rogue, which are forcibly kept down by his general habit of
      life?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      Do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his
      rogueries?
    </p>
<p>
      Where must I look?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The oligarchical man keeps up a fair outside, but he has only an enforced virtue and will cheat when he can.</span>
      You should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting
      dishonestly, as in the guardianship of an orphan.
    </p>
<p>
      Aye.
    </p>
<p>
      It will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give him
      a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage554D">D</a></span>passions by an enforced
      virtue; not making them see that they are wrong, or taming them by reason,
      but by necessity and fear constraining them, and because he trembles for
      his possessions.
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, indeed, my dear friend, but you will find that the natural desires of
      the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to spend what
      is not his own. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page261"></a>261</span>
</p>
<p>
      Yes, and they will be strong in him too.
    </p>
<p>
      The man, then, will be at war with himself; he will be two men, and not
      one; but, in general, his better desires <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage554E">E</a></span>will be found to prevail over his
      inferior ones.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      For these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people;
      yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far away
      and never come near him.
    </p>
<p>
      I should expect so.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage555A">555</a></span> <span class="sidenote">His meanness in a contest; he saves his money and loses the prize.</span>
      And surely, the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in a
      State for any prize of victory, or other object of honourable ambition; he
      will not spend his money in the contest for glory; so afraid is he of
      awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join in
      the struggle; in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small part
      only of his resources, and the result commonly is that he loses the prize
      and saves his money.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      Can we any longer doubt, then, that the miser and money-maker <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage555B">B</a></span>answers to
      the oligarchical State?
    </p>
<p>
      There can be no doubt.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Democracy arises out of the extravagance and indebtedness of men of family and position,</span>
      Next comes democracy; of this the origin and nature have still to be

    </p>
<p>
      That, he said, is our method.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise?
      Is it not on this wise?—The good at which such a State aims is to
      become as rich as possible, a desire which is insatiable?
    </p>
<p>
      What then?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage555C">C</a></span>
      The rulers, being aware that their power rests upon their wealth, refuse
      to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they
      gain by their ruin; they take interest from them and buy up their estates
      and thus increase their own wealth and importance?
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure.
    </p>
<p>
      There can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation
      cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any considerable
      extent; one or the other will <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage555D">D</a></span>be disregarded. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page262"></a>262</span>
</p>
<p>
      That is tolerably clear.
    </p>
<p>
      And in oligarchical States, from the general spread of carelessness and
      extravagance, men of good family have often been reduced to beggary?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, often.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">who remain in the city, and form a dangerous class ready to head a revolution.</span>
      And still they remain in the city; there they are, ready to sting and
      fully armed, and some of them owe money, some have forfeited their
      citizenship; a third class are in both predicaments; and they hate and
      conspire against those who have got their property, and against everybody
      else, and are <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage555E">E</a></span>eager for revolution.
    </p>
<p>
      That is true.
    </p>
<p>
      On the other hand, the men of business, stooping as they walk, and
      pretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined, insert
      their sting—that is, their money—into some one else who is not
      on his guard against them, and recover the parent sum many times over
      multiplied into a family of children: and so they make drone and pauper to
      abound in the State.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage556A">556</a></span>
      Yes, he said, there are plenty of them—that is certain.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Two remedies: (1) restrictions on the free use of property;</span>
      The evil blazes up like a fire; and they will not extinguish it, either by
      restricting a man’s use of his own property, or by another remedy:
    </p>
<p>
      What other?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">(2) contracts to be made at a man’s own risk.</span>
      One which is the next best, and has the advantage of compelling the
      citizens to look to their characters:—Let <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage556B">B</a></span>there be a general rule
      that every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk, and
      there will be less of this scandalous money-making, and the evils of which
      we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the State.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, they will be greatly lessened.
    </p>
<p>
      At present the governors, induced by the motives which I have named, treat
      their subjects badly; while they and their adherents, especially the young
      men of the governing class, are habituated to lead a life of luxury and
      idleness <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage556C">C</a></span>both of body and mind; they do nothing, and are incapable of
      resisting either pleasure or pain.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      They themselves care only for making money, and are as indifferent as the
      pauper to the cultivation of virtue. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page263"></a>263</span>
</p>
<p>
      Yes, quite as indifferent.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The subjects discover the weakness of their rulers.</span>
      Such is the state of affairs which prevails among them. And often rulers
      and their subjects may come in one another’s way, whether on a journey or
      on some other occasion of meeting, on a pilgrimage or a march, as
      fellow-soldiers or <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage556D">D</a></span>fellow-sailors; aye and they may observe the behaviour
      of each other in the very moment of danger—for where danger is,
      there is no fear that the poor will be despised by the rich—and very
      likely the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle at the side of a
      wealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion and has plenty of
      superfluous flesh—when he sees such an one puffing and at his
      wits’ end, how can he avoid drawing the conclusion that men like him are
      only rich because no one has the courage to despoil them? And when they
      meet in private will not people be <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage556E">E</a></span>saying to one another ‘Our warriors are
      not good for much’?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, I am quite aware that this is their way of talking.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">A slight cause, internal or external, may produce revolution.</span>
      And, as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without
      may bring on illness, and sometimes even when there is no external
      provocation a commotion may arise within—in the same way wherever
      there is weakness in the State there is also likely to be illness, of
      which the occasion may be very slight, the one party introducing from
      without their oligarchical, the other their democratical allies, and then
      the State falls sick, and is at war with herself; and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage557A">557</a></span>may be at times
      distracted, even when there is no external cause.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, surely.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Such is the origin and nature of democracy.</span>
      And then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their
      opponents, slaughtering some and banishing some, while to the remainder
      they give an equal share of freedom and power; and this is the form of
      government in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that is the nature of democracy, whether the revolution has
      been effected by arms, or whether fear has caused the opposite party to
      withdraw.
    </p>
<p>
      And now what is their manner of life, and what sort of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage557B">B</a></span>a government have
      they? for as the government is, such will be the man.
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly, he said. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page264"></a>264</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Democracy allows a man to do as he likes, and therefore contains the greatest variety of characters and constitutions.</span>
      In the first place, are they not free; and is not the city full of freedom
      and frankness—a man may say and do what he likes?
    </p>
<p>
      ’Tis said so, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And where freedom is, the individual is clearly able to order for himself
      his own life as he pleases?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage557C">C</a></span>
      Then in this kind of State there will be the greatest variety of human
      natures?
    </p>
<p>
      There will.
    </p>
<p>
      This, then, seems likely to be the fairest of States, being like an
      embroidered robe which is spangled with every sort of flower<a href="#Footnotebook89" id="FnAnchorbook89" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">9</span></a>. And just as
      women and children think a variety of colours to be of all things most
      charming, so there are many men to whom this State, which is spangled with
      the manners and characters of mankind, will appear to be the fairest of
      States.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook89"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook89" class="pginternal">9</a></span> Omitting <span class="transl" title="ti/ mê/n? e)/phê">τί μήν; ἔφη</span>.</p></div>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage557D">D</a></span>
      Yes, my good Sir, and there will be no better in which to look for a
      government.
    </p>
<p>
      Why?
    </p>
<p>
      Because of the liberty which reigns there—they have a complete
      assortment of constitutions; and he who has a mind to establish a State,
      as we have been doing, must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at
      which they sell them, and pick out the one that suits him; then, when he
      has made his choice, he may found his State.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage557E">E</a></span>
      He will be sure to have patterns enough.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The law falls into abeyance.</span>
      And there being no necessity, I said, for you to govern in this State,
      even if you have the capacity, or to be governed, unless you like, or go
      to war when the rest go to war, or to be at peace when others are at
      peace, unless you are so disposed—there being no necessity also,
      because some law forbids you to hold office or be a dicast, that you
      should not hold office or be a dicast, if you have a fancy—is not
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage558A">558</a></span>this a way of life which for the moment is supremely delightful?
    </p>
<p>
      For the moment, yes. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page265"></a>265</span>
</p>
<p>
      And is not their humanity to the condemned<a href="#Footnotebook810" id="FnAnchorbook810" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">10</span></a> in some cases quite charming?
      Have you not observed how, in a democracy, many persons, although they
      have been sentenced to death or exile, just stay where they are and walk
      about the world—the gentleman parades like a hero, and nobody sees
      or cares?
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook810"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook810" class="pginternal">10</a></span> Or, ‘the philosophical temper of the condemned.’</p></div>
<p>
      Yes, he replied, many and many a one.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage558B">B</a></span> <span class="sidenote">All principles of order and good taste are trampled under foot by democracy.</span>
      See too, I said, the forgiving spirit of democracy, and the ‘don’t care’
      about trifles, and the disregard which she shows of all the fine
      principles which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the city—as
      when we said that, except in the case of some rarely gifted nature, there
      never will be a good man who has not from his childhood been used to play
      amid things of beauty and make of them a joy and a study—how grandly
      does she trample all these fine notions of ours under her feet, never
      giving a thought to the pursuits which make a statesman, and promoting to
      honour any one who professes <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage558C">C</a></span>to be the people’s friend.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, she is of a noble spirit.
    </p>
<p>
      These and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy, which is
      a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and
      dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike.
    </p>
<p>
      We know her well.
    </p>
<p>
      Consider now, I said, what manner of man the individual is, or rather
      consider, as in the case of the State, how he comes into being.
    </p>
<p>
      Very good, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Is not this the way—he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage558D">D</a></span>father who has trained him in his own habits?
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Which are the necessary and which the unnecessary pleasures?</span>
      And, like his father, he keeps under by force the pleasures which are of
      the spending and not of the getting sort, being those which are called
      unnecessary?
    </p>
<p>
      Obviously.
    </p>
<p>
      Would you like, for the sake of clearness, to distinguish which are the
      necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures?
    </p>
<p>
      I should. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page266"></a>266</span>
</p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Necessary desires cannot be got rid of,</span>
      Are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage558E">E</a></span>rid, and of which
      the satisfaction is a benefit to us? And they are rightly called so,
      because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial and what
      is necessary, and cannot help it.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage559A">559</a></span>
      We are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?
    </p>
<p>
      We are not.
    </p>
<p>
      And the desires of which a man may get rid, if he takes pains from his
      youth upwards—of which the presence, moreover, does no good, and in
      some cases the reverse of good—shall we not be right in saying that
      all these are unnecessary?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Suppose we select an example of either kind, in order that we may have a
      general notion of them?
    </p>
<p>
      Very good.
    </p>
<p>
      Will not the desire of eating, that is, of simple food and condiments, in
      so far as they are required for health and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage559B">B</a></span>strength, be of the necessary
      class?
    </p>
<p>
      That is what I should suppose.
    </p>
<p>
      The pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways; it does us good and it is
      essential to the continuance of life?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">but may be indulged to excess.</span>
      But the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for
      health?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Illustration taken from eating and drinking.</span>
      And the desire which goes beyond this, of more delicate food, or other
      luxuries, which might generally be got rid of, if controlled and trained
      in youth, and is hurtful to the body, and hurtful to the soul in the
      pursuit of wisdom and virtue, may be <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage559C">C</a></span>rightly called unnecessary?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      May we not say that these desires spend, and that the others make money
      because they conduce to production?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds
      good?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures and
      desires of this sort, and was the slave <span class="pagenum"><a id="page267"></a>267</span> <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage559D">D</a></span>of the unnecessary desires,
      whereas he who was subject to the necessary only was miserly and
      oligarchical?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      Again, let us see how the democratical man grows out of the oligarchical:
      the following, as I suspect, is commonly the process.
    </p>
<p>
      What is the process?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The young oligarch is led away by his wild associates.</span>
      When a young man who has been brought up as we were just now describing,
      in a vulgar and miserly way, has tasted drones’ honey and has come to
      associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for him
      all sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasure—then, as you may
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage559E">E</a></span>imagine, the change will begin of the oligarchical principle within him
      into the democratical?
    </p>
<p>
      Inevitably.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">There are allies to either part of his nature.</span>
      And as in the city like was helping like, and the change was effected by
      an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens, so too
      the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without to
      assist the desires within him, that which is akin and alike again helping
      that which is akin and alike?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within him,
      whether the influence of a father or of kindred, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage560A">560</a></span>advising or rebuking him,
      then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite faction, and he
      goes to war with himself.
    </p>
<p>
      It must be so.
    </p>
<p>
      And there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the
      oligarchical, and some of his desires die, and others are banished; a
      spirit of reverence enters into the young man’s soul and order is
      restored.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that sometimes happens.
    </p>
<p>
      And then, again, after the old desires have been driven out, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage560B">B</a></span>fresh ones
      spring up, which are akin to them, and because he their father does not
      know how to educate them, wax fierce and numerous.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that is apt to be the way.
    </p>
<p>
      They draw him to his old associates, and holding secret intercourse with
      them, breed and multiply in him. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page268"></a>268</span>
</p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      At length they seize upon the citadel of the young man’s soul, which they
      perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and true
      words, which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to the
      gods, and are their best guardians and sentinels.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage560C">C</a></span>
      None better.
    </p>
<p>
      False and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their
      place.
    </p>
<p>
      They are certain to do so.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The progress of the oligarchic young man told in an allegory.</span>
      And so the young man returns into the country of the lotus-eaters, and
      takes up his dwelling there in the face of all men; and if any help be
      sent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him, the aforesaid vain
      conceits shut the gate of the king’s fastness; and they will neither allow
      the embassy itself to enter, nor if private advisers offer the fatherly
      counsel of the aged will they listen to them or receive them. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage560D">D</a></span>There is a
      battle and they gain the day, and then modesty, which they call silliness,
      is ignominiously thrust into exile by them, and temperance, which they
      nickname unmanliness, is trampled in the mire and cast forth; they
      persuade men that moderation and orderly expenditure are vulgarity and
      meanness, and so, by the help of a rabble of evil appetites, they drive
      them beyond the border.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, with a will.
    </p>
<p>
      And when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage560E">E</a></span>him who is now in
      their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries, the
      next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy and waste
      and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads, and a great
      company with them, hymning their praises and calling <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage561A">561</a></span>them by sweet names;
      insolence they term breeding, and anarchy liberty, and waste magnificence,
      and impudence courage. And so the young man passes out of his original
      nature, which was trained in the school of necessity, into the freedom and
      libertinism of useless and unnecessary pleasures.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, the change in him is visible enough.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">He becomes a rake; but he also sometimes stops short in his career and gives way to pleasures good and bad indifferently.</span>
      After this he lives on, spending his money and labour and time on
      unnecessary pleasures quite as much as on necessary <span class="pagenum"><a id="page269"></a>269</span> ones; but if he be
      fortunate, and is not too much disordered in his wits, when years have
      elapsed, and the heyday of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage561B">B</a></span>passion is over—supposing that he then
      re-admits into the city some part of the exiled virtues, and does not
      wholly give himself up to their successors—in that case he balances
      his pleasures and lives in a sort of equilibrium, putting the government
      of himself into the hands of the one which comes first and wins the turn;
      and when he has had enough of that, then into the hands of another; he
      despises none of them but encourages them all equally.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">He rejects all advice,</span>
      Neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word of
      advice; if any one says to him that some <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage561C">C</a></span>pleasures are the satisfactions
      of good and noble desires, and others of evil desires, and that he ought
      to use and honour some and chastise and master the others—whenever
      this is repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they are all
      alike, and that one is as good as another.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; that is the way with him.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">passing his life in the alternation from one extreme to another.</span>
      Yes, I said, he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the hour;
      and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute; then he
      becomes a water-drinker, and tries to get thin; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage561D">D</a></span>then he takes a turn at
      gymnastics; sometimes idling and neglecting everything, then once more
      living the life of a philosopher; often he is busy with politics, and
      starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes into his head; and, if
      he is emulous of any one who is a warrior, off he is in that direction, or
      of men of business, once more in that. His life has neither law nor order;
      and this distracted existence he terms joy and bliss and freedom; and so
      he goes on.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage561E">E</a></span>
      Yes, he replied, he is all liberty and equality.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">He is ‘not one, but all mankind’s epitome.’</span>
      Yes, I said; his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the lives
      of many;—he answers to the State which we described as fair and
      spangled. And many a man and many a woman will take him for their pattern,
      and many a constitution and many an example of manners is contained in
      him.
    </p>
<p>
      Just so.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage562A">562</a></span>
      Let him then be set over against democracy; he may truly be called the
      democratic man. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page270"></a>270</span>
</p>
<p>
      Let that be his place, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Tyranny and the tyrant.</span>
      Last of all comes the most beautiful of all, man and State alike, tyranny
      and the tyrant; these we have now to consider.
    </p>
<p>
      Quite true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Say then, my friend, In what manner does tyranny arise?—that it has
      a democratic origin is evident.
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      And does not tyranny spring from democracy in the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage562B">B</a></span>same manner as democracy
      from oligarchy—I mean, after a sort?
    </p>
<p>
      How?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The insatiable desire of wealth creates a demand for democracy, the insatiable desire of freedom creates a demand for tyranny.</span>
      The good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it was
      maintained was excess of wealth—am I not right?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things
      for the sake of money-getting was also the ruin of oligarchy?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And democracy has her own good, of which the insatiable desire brings her
      to dissolution?
    </p>
<p>
      What good?
    </p>
<p>
      Freedom, I replied; which, as they tell you in a democracy, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage562C">C</a></span>is the glory
      of the State—and that therefore in a democracy alone will the
      freeman of nature deign to dwell.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes; the saying is in every body’s mouth.
    </p>
<p>
      I was going to observe, that the insatiable desire of this and the neglect
      of other things introduces the change in democracy, which occasions a
      demand for tyranny.
    </p>
<p>
      How so?
    </p>
<p>
      When a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage562D">D</a></span>cup-bearers
      presiding over the feast, and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of
      freedom, then, unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful
      draught, she calls them to account and punishes them, and says that they
      are cursed oligarchs.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he replied, a very common occurrence.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Freedom in the end means anarchy.</span>
      Yes, I said; and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves who
      hug their chains and men of naught; she would have subjects who are like
      rulers, and rulers who are <span class="pagenum"><a id="page271"></a>271</span> like subjects: these are men after her own
      heart, whom she praises and honours both in private and public. Now, in
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage562E">E</a></span>such a State, can liberty have any limit?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      By degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses, and ends by
      getting among the animals and infecting them.
    </p>
<p>
      How do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      I mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his
      sons and to fear them, and the son is on a level with his father, he
      having no respect or reverence for either of his parents; and this is his
      freedom, and the metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen with the
      metic, and the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage563A">563</a></span>stranger is quite as good as either.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that is the way.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The inversion of all social relations.</span>
      And these are not the only evils, I said—there are several lesser
      ones: In such a state of society the master fears and flatters his
      scholars, and the scholars despise their masters and tutors; young and old
      are all alike; and the young man is on a level with the old, and is ready
      to compete with him in word or deed; and old men condescend to the young
      and are full of pleasantry and gaiety; they are loth to be <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage563B">B</a></span>thought morose
      and authoritative, and therefore they adopt the manners of the young.
    </p>
<p>
      Quite true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      The last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with money,
      whether male or female, is just as free as his or her purchaser; nor must
      I forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes in relation
      to each other.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage563C">C</a></span>
      Why not, as Aeschylus says, utter the word which rises to our lips?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Freedom among the animals.</span>
      That is what I am doing, I replied; and I must add that no one who does
      not know would believe, how much greater is the liberty which the animals
      who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in any other
      State: for truly, the she-dogs, as the proverb says, are as good as their
      she-mistresses, and the horses and asses have a way of marching along with
      all the rights and dignities of freemen; and they will run at any body who
      comes in their way if he does not leave the road clear for them: and all
      things are <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage563D">D</a></span>just ready to burst with liberty. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page272"></a>272</span>
</p>
<p>
      When I take a country walk, he said, I often experience what you describe.
      You and I have dreamed the same thing.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">No law, no authority.</span>
      And above all, I said, and as the result of all, see how sensitive the
      citizens become; they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority,
      and at length, as you know, they cease to care even for the laws, written
      or unwritten; they will have <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage563E">E</a></span>no one over them.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, I know it too well.
    </p>
<p>
      Such, my friend, I said, is the fair and glorious beginning out of which
      springs tyranny.
    </p>
<p>
      Glorious indeed, he said. But what is the next step?
    </p>
<p>
      The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; the same disease magnified
      and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy—the truth being
      that the excessive <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage564A">564</a></span>increase of anything often causes a reaction in the
      opposite direction; and this is the case not only in the seasons and in
      vegetable and animal life, but above all in forms of government.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      The excess of liberty, whether in States or individuals, seems only to
      pass into excess of slavery.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, the natural order.
    </p>
<p>
      And so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated
      form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty?
    </p>
<p>
      As we might expect.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The common evil of oligarchy and democracy is the class of idle spend-thrifts.</span>
      That, however, was not, as I believe, your question—you rather
      desired to know what is that disorder which is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage564B">B</a></span>generated alike in
      oligarchy and democracy, and is the ruin of both?
    </p>
<p>
      Just so, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, I said, I meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts, of whom
      the more courageous are the leaders and the more timid the followers, the
      same whom we were comparing to drones, some stingless, and others having
      stings.
    </p>
<p>
      A very just comparison.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Illustration.</span>
      These two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are
      generated, being what phlegm and bile are to the body. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage564C">C</a></span>And the good
      physician and lawgiver of the State <span class="pagenum"><a id="page273"></a>273</span> ought, like the wise bee-master, to
      keep them at a distance and prevent, if possible, their ever coming in;
      and if they have anyhow found a way in, then he should have them and their
      cells cut out as speedily as possible.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, by all means, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Altogether three classes in a democracy.</span>
      Then, in order that we may see clearly what we are doing, let us imagine
      democracy to be divided, as indeed it is, into <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage564D">D</a></span>three classes; for in the
      first place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic than
      there were in the oligarchical State.
    </p>
<p>
      That is true.
    </p>
<p>
      And in the democracy they are certainly more intensified.
    </p>
<p>
      How so?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">(1) The drones or spend-thrifts who are more numerous and active than in the oligarchy.</span>
      Because in the oligarchical State they are disqualified and driven from
      office, and therefore they cannot train or gather strength; whereas in a
      democracy they are almost the entire ruling power, and while the keener
      sort speak and act, the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage564E">E</a></span>not suffer
      a word to be said on the other side; hence in democracies almost
      everything is managed by the drones.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then there is another class which is always being severed from the mass.
    </p>
<p>
      What is that?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">(2) The orderly or wealthy class who are fed upon by the drones.</span>
      They are the orderly class, which in a nation of traders is sure to be the
      richest.
    </p>
<p>
      Naturally so.
    </p>
<p>
      They are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of honey
      to the drones.
    </p>
<p>
      Why, he said, there is little to be squeezed out of people who have
      little.
    </p>
<p>
      And this is called the wealthy class, and the drones feed upon them.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage565A">565</a></span>
      That is pretty much the case, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">(3) The working class who also get a share.</span>
      The people are a third class, consisting of those who work with their own
      hands; they are not politicians, and have not much to live upon. This,
      when assembled, is the largest and most powerful class in a democracy.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said; but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate
      unless they get a little honey. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page274"></a>274</span>
</p>
<p>
      And do they not share? I said. Do not their leaders deprive the rich of
      their estates and distribute them among the people; at the same time
      taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage565B">B</a></span>
      Why, yes, he said, to that extent the people do share.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The well-to-do have to defend themselves against the people.</span>
      And the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to defend
      themselves before the people as they best can?
    </p>
<p>
      What else can they do?
    </p>
<p>
      And then, although they may have no desire of change, the others charge
      them with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And the end is that when they see the people, not of their own accord, but
      through ignorance, and because they are <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage565C">C</a></span>deceived by informers, seeking to
      do them wrong, then at last they are forced to become oligarchs in
      reality; they do not wish to be, but the sting of the drones torments them
      and breeds revolution in them.
    </p>
<p>
      That is exactly the truth.
    </p>
<p>
      Then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The people have a protector who, when once he tastes blood, is converted into a tyrant.</span>
      The people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse
      into greatness.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, that is their way.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage565D">D</a></span>
      This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he first
      appears above ground he is a protector.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, that is quite clear.
    </p>
<p>
      How then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant? Clearly when he
      does what the man is said to do in the tale of the Arcadian temple of
      Lycaean Zeus.
    </p>
<p>
      What tale?
    </p>
<p>
      The tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human victim
      minced up with the entrails of other victims is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage565E">E</a></span>destined to become a wolf.
      Did you never hear it?
    </p>
<p>
      Oh, yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And the protector of the people is like him; having a mob entirely at his
      disposal, he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen; by the
      favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court and murders
      them, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page275"></a>275</span> making the life of man to disappear, and with unholy tongue and lips
      tasting the blood of his fellow citizens; some he kills and others he
      banishes, at the same time hinting at the abolition of debts and partition
      of lands: and after this, what <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage566A">566</a></span>will be his destiny? Must he not either
      perish at the hands of his enemies, or from being a man become a wolf—that
      is, a tyrant?
    </p>
<p>
      Inevitably.
    </p>
<p>
      This, I said, is he who begins to make a party against the rich?
    </p>
<p>
      The same.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">After a time he is driven out, but comes back a full-blown tyrant.</span>
      After a while he is driven out, but comes back, in spite of his enemies, a
      tyrant full grown.
    </p>
<p>
      That is clear.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage566B">B</a></span>
      And if they are unable to expel him, or to get him condemned to death by a
      public accusation, they conspire to assassinate him.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that is their usual way.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The body-guard.</span>
      Then comes the famous request for a body-guard, which is the device of all
      those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career—‘Let not the
      people’s friend,’ as they say, ‘be lost to them.’
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p>
      The people readily assent; all their fears are for him—they have
      none for themselves.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage566C">C</a></span>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy of the
      people sees this, then, my friend, as the oracle said to Croesus,
    </p>
<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="noind">
      ‘By pebbly Hermus’ shore he flees and rests not, and is not ashamed to be
      a coward<a href="#Footnotebook811" id="FnAnchorbook811" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">11</span></a>.’

<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook811"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook811" class="pginternal">11</a></span> Herod. i. 55.</p></div>
<p>
      And quite right too, said he, for if he were, he would never be ashamed
      again.
    </p>
<p>
      But if he is caught he dies.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage566D">D</a></span> <span class="sidenote">The protector standing up in the chariot of State.</span>
      And he, the protector of whom we spoke, is to be seen, not ‘larding the
      plain’ with his bulk, but himself the overthrower of many, standing up in
      the chariot of State with the reins in his hand, no longer protector, but
      tyrant absolute. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page276"></a>276</span>
</p>
<p>
      No doubt, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And now let us consider the happiness of the man, and also of the State in
      which a creature like him is generated.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, let us consider that.
    </p>
<p>
      At first, in the early days of his power, he is full of smiles, and he
      salutes every one whom he meets;—he to be called <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage566E">E</a></span>a tyrant, who is
      making promises in public and also in private! liberating debtors, and
      distributing land to the people and his followers, and wanting to be so
      kind and good to every one!
    </p>
<p>
      Of course, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">He stirs up wars, and impoverishes his subjects by the imposition of taxes.</span>
      But when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty, and
      there is nothing to fear from them, then he is always stirring up some war
      or other, in order that the people may require a leader.
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage567A">567</a></span>
      Has he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished by
      payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily
      wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      And if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom, and
      of resistance to his authority, he will have a good pretext for destroying
      them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy; and for all these reasons
      the tyrant must be always getting up a war.
    </p>
<p>
      He must.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage567B">B</a></span>
      Now he begins to grow unpopular.
    </p>
<p>
      A necessary result.
    </p>
<p>
      Then some of those who joined in setting him up, and who are in power,
      speak their minds to him and to one another, and the more courageous of
      them cast in his teeth what is being done.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, that may be expected.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">He gets rid of his bravest and boldest followers.</span>
      And the tyrant, if he means to rule, must get rid of them; he cannot stop
      while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything.
    </p>
<p>
      He cannot.
    </p>
<p>
      And therefore he must look about him and see who is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage567C">C</a></span>valiant, who is
      high-minded, who is wise, who is wealthy; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page277"></a>277</span> happy man, he is the enemy of
      them all, and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no, until
      he has made a purgation of the State.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, and a rare purgation.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">His purgation of the State.</span>
      Yes, I said, not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of the
      body; for they take away the worse and leave the better part, but he does
      the reverse.
    </p>
<p>
      If he is to rule, I suppose that he cannot help himself.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage567D">D</a></span>
      What a blessed alternative, I said:—to be compelled to dwell only
      with the many bad, and to be by them hated, or not to live at all!
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, that is the alternative.
    </p>
<p>
      And the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more
      satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And who are the devoted band, and where will he procure them?
    </p>
<p>
      They will flock to him, he said, of their own accord, if he pays them.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">More drones.</span>
      By the dog! I said, here are more drones, of every sort <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage567E">E</a></span>and from every
      land.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, there are.
    </p>
<p>
      But will he not desire to get them on the spot?
    </p>
<p>
      How do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      He will rob the citizens of their slaves; he will then set them free and
      enrol them in his body-guard.
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure, he said; and he will be able to trust them best of all.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">He puts to death his friends and lives with the slaves whom he has enfranchised.</span>
      What a blessed creature, I said, must this tyrant be; he <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage568A">568</a></span>has put to death
      the others and has these for his trusted friends.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; they are quite of his sort.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, and these are the new citizens whom he has called into
      existence, who admire him and are his companions, while the good hate and
      avoid him.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Euripides and the tragedians praise tyranny, which is an excellent reason for expelling them from our State.</span>
      Verily, then, tragedy is a wise thing and Euripides a great tragedian.
    </p>
<p>
      Why so? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page278"></a>278</span>
</p>
<p>
      Why, because he is the author of the pregnant saying,
    </p>
<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p class="noind">
<span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage568B">B</a></span>
      ‘Tyrants are wise by living with the wise;’
    </p></div></div>
<p class="noind">
      and he clearly meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant makes
      his companions.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage568C">C</a></span>
      Yes, he said, and he also praises tyranny as godlike; and many other
      things of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets.
    </p>
<p>
      And therefore, I said, the tragic poets being wise men will forgive us and
      any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them into our
      State, because they are the eulogists of tyranny.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, those who have the wit will doubtless forgive us.
    </p>
<p>
      But they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs, and hire
      voices fair and loud and persuasive, and draw the cities over to tyrannies
      and democracies.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      Moreover, they are paid for this and receive honour—the greatest
      honour, as might be expected, from tyrants, and the next greatest from
      democracies; but the higher they ascend <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage568D">D</a></span>our constitution hill, the more
      their reputation fails, and seems unable from shortness of breath to
      proceed further.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      But we are wandering from the subject: Let us therefore return and enquire
      how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various and
      ever-changing army of his.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The tyrant seizes the treasures in the temples, and when these fail feeds upon the people.</span>
      If, he said, there are sacred treasures in the city, he will confiscate
      and spend them; and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons may
      suffice, he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would otherwise
      have to impose upon the people.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage568E">E</a></span>
      And when these fail?
    </p>
<p>
      Why, clearly, he said, then he and his boon companions, whether male or
      female, will be maintained out of his father’s estate.
    </p>
<p>
      You mean to say that the people, from whom he has derived his being, will
      maintain him and his companions?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; they cannot help themselves.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">They rebel, and then he beats his own parent, i.e. the people.</span>
      But what if the people fly into a passion, and aver that a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page279"></a>279</span> grown-up son
      ought not to be supported by his father, but <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage569A">569</a></span>that the father should be
      supported by the son? The father did not bring him into being, or settle
      him in life, in order that when his son became a man he should himself be
      the servant of his own servants and should support him and his rabble of
      slaves and companions; but that his son should protect him, and that by
      his help he might be emancipated from the government of the rich and
      aristocratic, as they are termed. And so he bids him and his companions
      depart, just as any other father might drive out of the house a riotous
      son and his undesirable associates.
    </p>
<p>
      By heaven, he said, then the parent will discover what <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage569B">B</a></span>a monster he has
      been fostering in his bosom; and, when he wants to drive him out, he will
      find that he is weak and his son strong.
    </p>
<p>
      Why, you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence? What! beat
      his father if he opposes him?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he will, having first disarmed him.
    </p>
<p>
      Then he is a parricide, and a cruel guardian of an aged parent; and this
      is real tyranny, about which there can be no longer a mistake: as the
      saying is, the people who would escape the smoke which is the slavery of
      freemen, has fallen <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage569C">C</a></span>into the fire which is the tyranny of slaves. Thus
      liberty, getting out of all order and reason, passes into the harshest and
      bitterest form of slavery.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Very well; and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently discussed
      the nature of tyranny, and the manner of the transition from democracy to
      tyranny?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, quite enough, he said.

      how is he formed out of the democratical? and how does he live, in
      happiness or in misery?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, he is the only one remaining.
    </p>
<p>
      There is, however, I said, a previous question which remains unanswered.
    </p>
<p>
      What question?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">A digression having a purpose.</span>
      I do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number of
      the appetites, and until this is accomplished <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage571B">B</a></span>the enquiry will always be
      confused.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, he said, it is not too late to supply the omission.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The wild beast latent in man peers forth in sleep.</span>
      Very true, I said; and observe the point which I want to understand:
      Certain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites I conceive to be
      unlawful; every one appears to have them, but in some persons they are
      controlled by the laws and by reason, and the better desires prevail over
      them—either they are wholly banished or they become few and weak;
      while in the case of others they are stronger, and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage571C">C</a></span>there are more of them.
    </p>
<p>
      Which appetites do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      I mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling power
      is asleep; then the wild beast within us, gorged with meat or drink,
      starts up and having shaken off sleep, goes forth to satisfy his desires;
      and there <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage571D">D</a></span>is no conceivable folly or crime—not excepting incest or
      any other unnatural union, or parricide, or the eating of forbidden food—which
      at such a time, when he has parted company with all shame and sense, a man
      may not be ready to commit.
    </p>
<p>
      Most true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The contrast of the temperate man whose passions are under the control of reason.</span>
      But when a man’s pulse is healthy and temperate, and when before going to
      sleep he has awakened his rational <span class="pagenum"><a id="page281"></a>281</span> powers, and fed them on noble thoughts
      and enquiries, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage571E">E</a></span>collecting himself in meditation; after having first
      indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little, but just enough to
      lay them to sleep, and prevent them and their enjoyments <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage572A">572</a></span>and pains from
      interfering with the higher principle—which he leaves in the
      solitude of pure abstraction, free to contemplate and aspire to the
      knowledge of the unknown, whether in past, present, or future: when again
      he has allayed the passionate element, if he has a quarrel against any one—I
      say, when, after pacifying the two irrational principles, he rouses up the
      third, which is reason, before he takes his rest, then, as you know, he
      attains truth most nearly, and is least <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage572B">B</a></span>likely to be the sport of
      fantastic and lawless visions.
    </p>
<p>
      I quite agree.
    </p>
<p>
      In saying this I have been running into a digression; but the point which
      I desire to note is that in all of us, even in good men, there is a
      lawless wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep. Pray, consider
      whether I am right, and you agree with me.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I agree.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Recapitulation.</span>
      And now remember the character which we attributed <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage572C">C</a></span>to the democratic man.
      He was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under a
      miserly parent, who encouraged the saving appetites in him, but
      discountenanced the unnecessary, which aim only at amusement and ornament?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And then he got into the company of a more refined, licentious sort of
      people, and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite
      extreme from an abhorrence of his father’s meanness. At last, being a
      better man than his corruptors, he was drawn in both directions until he
      halted <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage572D">D</a></span>midway and led a life, not of vulgar and slavish passion, but of
      what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures. After this manner
      the democrat was generated out of the oligarch?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; that was our view of him, and is so still.
    </p>
<p>
      And now, I said, years will have passed away, and you must conceive this
      man, such as he is, to have a son, who is brought up in his father’s
      principles.
    </p>
<p>
      I can imagine him. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page282"></a>282</span>
</p>
<p>
      Then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which
      has already happened to the father:—he is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage572E">E</a></span>drawn into a perfectly
      lawless life, which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty; and his
      father and friends take part with his moderate desires, and the opposite
      party assist the opposite ones. As soon as these dire magicians and
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage573A">573</a></span>tyrant-makers find that they are losing their hold on him, they contrive
      to implant in him a master passion, to be lord over his idle and
      spendthrift lusts—a sort of monstrous winged drone—that is the
      only image which will adequately describe him.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that is the only adequate image of him.
    </p>
<p>
      And when his other lusts, amid clouds of incense and perfumes and garlands
      and wines, and all the pleasures of a dissolute life, now let loose, come
      buzzing around him, nourishing to the utmost the sting of desire which
      they implant in his drone-like nature, then at last this lord of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage573B">B</a></span>the soul,
      having Madness for the captain of his guard, breaks out into a frenzy: and
      if he finds in himself any good opinions or appetites in process of
      formation<a href="#Footnotebook91" id="FnAnchorbook91" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">1</span></a>, and there is in him any sense of shame remaining, to these
      better principles he puts an end, and casts them forth until he has purged
      away temperance and brought in madness to the full.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook91"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook91" class="pginternal">1</a></span> Or, ‘opinions or appetites such as are deemed to be good.’</p></div>
<p><span class="sidenote">The tyrannical man is made up of lusts and appetites. Love, drink, madness are but different forms of tyranny.</span>
      Yes, he said, that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated.
    </p>
<p>
      And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?
    </p>
<p>
      I should not wonder.
    </p>
<p>
      Further, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage573C">C</a></span>a tyrant?
    </p>
<p>
      He has.
    </p>
<p>
      And you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind, will
      fancy that he is able to rule, not only over men, but also over the gods?
    </p>
<p>
      That he will.
    </p>
<p>
      And the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being
      when, either under the influence of nature, or habit, or both, he becomes
      drunken, lustful, passionate? O my friend, is not that so? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page283"></a>283</span>
</p>
<p>
      Assuredly.
    </p>
<p>
      Such is the man and such is his origin. And next, how does he live?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage573D">D</a></span>
      Suppose, as people facetiously say, you were to tell me.
    </p>
<p>
      I imagine, I said, at the next step in his progress, that there will be
      feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans, and all that sort of
      thing; Love is the lord of the house within him, and orders all the
      concerns of his soul.
    </p>
<p>
      That is certain.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes; and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable,
      and their demands are many.
    </p>
<p>
      They are indeed, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      His revenues, if he has any, are soon spent.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage573E">E</a></span>
      Then comes debt and the cutting down of his property.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">His desires become greater and his means less.</span>
      When he has nothing left, must not his desires, crowding in the nest like
      young ravens, be crying aloud for food; and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage574A">574</a></span>he, goaded on by them, and
      especially by love himself, who is in a manner the captain of them, is in
      a frenzy, and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil of his
      property, in order that he may gratify them?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, that is sure to be the case.
    </p>
<p>
      He must have money, no matter how, if he is to escape horrid pains and
      pangs.
    </p>
<p>
      He must.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">He will rob his father and mother.</span>
      And as in himself there was a succession of pleasures, and the new got the
      better of the old and took away their rights, so he being younger will
      claim to have more than his father and his mother, and if he has spent his
      own share of the property, he will take a slice of theirs.
    </p>
<p>
      No doubt he will.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage574B">B</a></span>
      And if his parents will not give way, then he will try first of all to
      cheat and deceive them.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And if he fails, then he will use force and plunder them.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, probably.
    </p>
<p>
      And if the old man and woman fight for their own, what then, my friend?
      Will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page284"></a>284</span>
</p>
<p>
      Nay, he said, I should not feel at all comfortable about his parents.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">He will prefer the love of a girl or a youth to his aged parents, and may even be induced to strike them.</span>
      But, O heavens! Adeimantus, on account of some new-fangled love of a
      harlot, who is anything but a necessary <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage574C">C</a></span>connection, can you believe that
      he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary to his
      very existence, and would place her under the authority of the other, when
      she is brought under the same roof with her; or that, under like
      circumstances, he would do the same to his withered old father, first and
      most indispensable of friends, for the sake of some newly-found blooming
      youth who is the reverse of indispensable?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, indeed, he said; I believe that he would.
    </p>
<p>
      Truly, then, I said, a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and
      mother.
    </p>
<p>
      He is indeed, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage574D">D</a></span> <span class="sidenote">He turns
highwayman, robs temples, loses all his early principles, and becomes in
 waking reality the evil dream which he had in sleep.<br>He gathers followers about him.</span>
      He first takes their property, and when that fails, and pleasures are
      beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul, then he breaks into a house,
      or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer; next he proceeds to clear
      a temple. Meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child, and which
      gave judgment about good and evil, are overthrown by those others which
      have just been emancipated, and are now the body-guard of love and share
      his empire. These in his democratic days, when he was still subject to the
      laws <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage574E">E</a></span>and to his father, were only let loose in the dreams of sleep. But
      now that he is under the dominion of love, he becomes always and in waking
      reality what he was then very rarely and in a dream only; he will commit
      the foulest murder, or eat forbidden food, or be guilty of any other
      horrid act. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage575A">575</a></span>Love is his tyrant, and lives lordly in him and lawlessly, and
      being himself a king, leads him on, as a tyrant leads a State, to the
      performance of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and the
      rabble of his associates, whether those whom evil communications have
      brought in from without, or those whom he himself has allowed to break
      loose within him by reason of a similar evil nature in himself. Have we
      not here a picture of his way of life?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, indeed, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And if there are only a few of them in the State, and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page285"></a>285</span> <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage575B">B</a></span>rest of the
      people are well disposed, they go away and become the body-guard or
      mercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them for a
      war; and if there is no war, they stay at home and do many little pieces
      of mischief in the city.
    </p>
<p>
      What sort of mischief?
    </p>
<p>
      For example, they are the thieves, burglars, cut-purses, foot-pads,
      robbers of temples, man-stealers of the community; or if they are able to
      speak they turn informers, and bear false witness, and take bribes.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage575C">C</a></span>

      number.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">A private person can do but little harm in comparison of the tyrant.</span>
      Yes, I said; but small and great are comparative terms, and all these
      things, in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a State, do not
      come within a thousand miles of the tyrant; when this noxious class and
      their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength,
      assisted by the infatuation of the people, they choose from among
      themselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage575D">D</a></span>and him
      they create their tyrant.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant.
    </p>
<p>
      If the people yield, well and good; but if they resist him, as he began by
      beating his own father and mother, so now, if he has the power, he beats
      them, and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland, as the Cretans
      say, in subjection to his young retainers whom he has introduced to be
      their rulers and masters. This is the end of his passions and desires.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage575E">E</a></span>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The behaviour of the tyrant to his early supporters.</span>
      When such men are only private individuals and before they get power, this
      is their character; they associate entirely with their own flatterers or
      ready tools; or if they want anything from anybody, they in their turn are
      equally ready to bow down before them: they profess every sort of
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage576A">576</a></span>affection for them; but when they have gained their point they know them
      no more.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, truly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">He is always either  master or servant, always treacherous, unjust, the waking reality of our dream, a tyrant by nature, a tyrant in fact.</span>
      They are always either the masters or servants and never the friends of
      anybody; the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page286"></a>286</span>
</p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      And may we not rightly call such men treacherous?
    </p>
<p>
      No question.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage576B">B</a></span>
      Also they are utterly unjust, if we were right in our notion of justice?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, and we were perfectly right.
    </p>
<p>
      Let us then sum up in a word, I said, the character of the worst man: he
      is the waking reality of what we dreamed.
    </p>
<p>
      Most true.
    </p>
<p>
      And this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule, and the
      longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>, G<span class="smcap">LAUCON</span>.</span>
      That is certain, said Glaucon, taking his turn to answer.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The wicked are also the most miserable.</span>
      And will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage576C">C</a></span>be also the most
      miserable? and he who has tyrannized longest and most, most continually
      and truly miserable; although this may not be the opinion of men in
      general?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, inevitably.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Like man, like State.</span>
      And must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical State, and the
      democratical man like the democratical State; and the same of the others?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And as State is to State in virtue and happiness, so is man in relation to
      man?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage576D">D</a></span>
      To be sure.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The opposite of the king.</span>
      Then comparing our original city, which was under a king, and the city
      which is under a tyrant, how do they stand as to virtue?
    </p>
<p>
      They are the opposite extremes, he said, for one is the very best and the
      other is the very worst.
    </p>
<p>
      There can be no mistake, I said, as to which is which, and therefore I
      will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision about
      their relative happiness and misery. And here we must not allow ourselves
      to be panic-stricken at the apparition of the tyrant, who is only a unit
      and may perhaps have a few retainers about him; but let us go as we <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage576E">E</a></span>ought
      into every corner of the city and look all about, and then we will give
      our opinion.
    </p>
<p>
      A fair invitation, he replied; and I see, as every one must, that a
      tyranny is the wretchedest form of government, and the rule of a king the
      happiest. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page287"></a>287</span>
</p>
<p>
      And in estimating the men too, may I not fairly make <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage577A">577</a></span>a like request, that
      I should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through human
      nature? he must not be like a child who looks at the outside and is
      dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to the
      beholder, but let him be one who has a clear insight. May I suppose that
      the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able to
      judge, and has dwelt in the same place with him, and been present at his
      dally life and known <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage577B">B</a></span>him in his family relations, where he may be seen
      stripped of his tragedy attire, and again in the hour of public danger—he
      shall tell us about the happiness and misery of the tyrant when compared
      with other men?
    </p>
<p>
      That again, he said, is a very fair proposal.
    </p>
<p>
      Shall I assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and have
      before now met with such a person? We shall then have some one who will
      answer our enquiries.
    </p>
<p>
      By all means.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage577C">C</a></span>
      Let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the State;
      bearing this in mind, and glancing in turn from one to the other of them,
      will you tell me their respective conditions?
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean? he asked.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The State is not free, but enslaved.</span>
      Beginning with the State, I replied, would you say that a city which is
      governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved?
    </p>
<p>
      No city, he said, can be more completely enslaved.
    </p>
<p>
      And yet, as you see, there are freemen as well as masters in such a State?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, I see that there are—a few; but the people, speaking
      generally, and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage577D">D</a></span> <span class="sidenote">Like a slave, the tyrant is full of meanness, and the ruling part of him is madness.</span>
      Then if the man is like the State, I said, must not the same rule prevail?
      his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity—the best elements in him
      are enslaved; and there is a small ruling part, which is also the worst
      and maddest.
    </p>
<p>
      Inevitably.
    </p>
<p>
      And would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman,
      or of a slave?
    </p>
<p>
      He has the soul of a slave, in my opinion. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page288"></a>288</span>
</p>
<p>
      And the State which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of
      acting voluntarily?
    </p>
<p>
      Utterly incapable.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage577E">E</a></span> <span class="sidenote">The city which is subject to him is goaded by a gadfly;</span>
      And also the soul which is under a tyrant (I am speaking of the soul taken
      as a whole) is least capable of doing what she desires; there is a gadfly
      which goads her, and she is full of trouble and remorse?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?
    </p>
<p>
      Poor.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage578A">578</a></span> <span class="sidenote">poor;</span>
      And the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And must not such a State and such a man be always full of fear?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, indeed.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">full of misery.</span>
      Is there any State in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow
      and groaning and pain?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      And is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery
      than in the tyrannical man, who is in a fury of passions and desires?
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage578B">B</a></span>
      Reflecting upon these and similar evils, you held the tyrannical State to
      be the most miserable of States?
    </p>
<p>
      And I was right, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Also the tyrannical man is most miserable.</span>
      Certainly, I said. And when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man,
      what do you say of him?
    </p>
<p>
      I say that he is by far the most miserable of all men.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Yet there is a still more miserable being, the tyrannical man who is a public tyrant.</span>
      There, I said, I think that you are beginning to go wrong.
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      I do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery.
    </p>
<p>
      Then who is more miserable?
    </p>
<p>
      One of whom I am about to speak.
    </p>
<p>
      Who is that?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage578C">C</a></span>
      He who is of a tyrannical nature, and instead of leading a private life
      has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant.
    </p>
<p>
      From what has been said, I gather that you are right. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page289"></a>289</span>
</p>
<p>
      Yes, I replied, but in this high argument you should be a little more
      certain, and should not conjecture only; for of all questions, this
      respecting good and evil is the greatest.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Let me then offer you an illustration, which may, I think, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage578D">D</a></span>throw a light
      upon this subject.
    </p>
<p>
      What is your illustration?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">In cities there are many great slaveowners, and they help to protect one another.</span>
      The case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves: from them
      you may form an idea of the tyrant’s condition, for they both have slaves;
      the only difference is that he has more slaves.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, that is the difference.
    </p>
<p>
      You know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from their
      servants?
    </p>
<p>
      What should they fear?
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing. But do you observe the reason of this?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes; the reason is, that the whole city is leagued together for the
      protection of each individual.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage578E">E</a></span> <span class="sidenote">But suppose a
slaveowner and his slaves carried off into the wilderness, what will
happen then? Such is the condition of the tyrant.</span>
      Very true, I said. But imagine one of these owners, the master say of some
      fifty slaves, together with his family and property and slaves, carried
      off by a god into the wilderness, where there are no freemen to help him—will
      he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and children should be
      put to death by his slaves?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, he will be in the utmost fear.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage579A">579</a></span>
      The time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of his
      slaves, and make many promises to them of freedom and other things, much
      against his will—he will have to cajole his own servants.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that will be the only way of saving himself.
    </p>
<p>
      And suppose the same god, who carried him away, to surround him with
      neighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another, and
      who, if they could catch the offender, would take his life?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage579B">B</a></span>
      His case will be still worse, if you suppose him to be everywhere
      surrounded and watched by enemies.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">He is the daintiest of all men and has to endure the hardships of a prison;</span>
      And is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound—he
      who being by nature such as we have described, is full of all sorts of
      fears and lusts? His soul is dainty and greedy, and yet alone, of all men
      in the city, he is never <span class="pagenum"><a id="page290"></a>290</span> allowed to go on a journey, or to see the things
      which other freemen desire to see, but he lives in his hole like a woman
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage579C">C</a></span>hidden in the house, and is jealous of any other citizen who goes into
      foreign parts and sees anything of interest.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Miserable in himself, he is still more miserable if he be in a public station.</span>
      And amid evils such as these will not he who is ill-governed in his own
      person—the tyrannical man, I mean—whom you just now decided to
      be the most miserable of all—will not he be yet more miserable when,
      instead of leading a private life, he is constrained by fortune to be a
      public tyrant? He has to be master of others when he is not master of
      himself: he is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass
      his <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage579D">D</a></span>life, not in retirement, but fighting and combating with other men.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, the similitude is most exact.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">He then leads a life worse than the worst,</span>
      Is not his case utterly miserable? and does not the actual tyrant lead a
      worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">in unhappiness,</span>
      He who is the real tyrant, whatever men may think, is the real slave, and
      is obliged to practise the greatest adulation <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage579E">E</a></span>and servility, and to be the
      flatterer of the vilest of mankind. He has desires which he is utterly
      unable to satisfy, and has more wants than any one, and is truly poor, if
      you know how to inspect the whole soul of him: all his life long he is
      beset with fear and is full of convulsions and distractions, even as the
      State which he resembles: and surely the resemblance holds?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage580A">580</a></span> <span class="sidenote">and in wickedness.</span>
      Moreover, as we were saying before, he grows worse from having power: he
      becomes and is of necessity more jealous, more faithless, more unjust,
      more friendless, more impious, than he was at first; he is the purveyor
      and cherisher of every sort of vice, and the consequence is that he is
      supremely miserable, and that he makes everybody else as miserable as
      himself.
    </p>
<p>
      No man of any sense will dispute your words.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The umpire decides that</span>
      Come then, I said, and as the general umpire in theatrical <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage580B">B</a></span>contests
      proclaims the result, do you also decide who in your opinion is first in
      the scale of happiness, and who second, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page291"></a>291</span> and in what order the others
      follow: there are five of them in all—they are the royal,
      timocratical, oligarchical, democratical, tyrannical.
    </p>
<p>
      The decision will be easily given, he replied; they shall be choruses
      coming on the stage, and I must judge them in the order in which they
      enter, by the criterion of virtue and vice, happiness and misery.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">the best is the happiest and the worst is the most miserable. This is the proclamation of the son of Ariston.</span>
      Need we hire a herald, or shall I announce, that the son of Ariston [the
      best] has decided that the best and justest <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage580C">C</a></span>is also the happiest, and that
      this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself; and that the
      worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable, and that this is he
      who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest tyrant of
      his State?
    </p>
<p>
      Make the proclamation yourself, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And shall I add, ‘whether seen or unseen by gods and men’?
    </p>
<p>
      Let the words be added.
    </p>
<p>
      Then this, I said, will be our first proof; and there is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage580D">D</a></span>another, which
      may also have some weight.
    </p>
<p>
      What is that?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Proof, derived from the three principles of the soul.</span>
      The second proof is derived from the nature of the soul: seeing that the
      individual soul, like the State, has been divided by us into three
      principles, the division may, I think, furnish a new demonstration.
    </p>
<p>
      Of what nature?
    </p>
<p>
      It seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond;
      also three desires and governing powers.
    </p>
<p>
      How do you mean? he said.
    </p>
<p>
      There is one principle with which, as we were saying, a man learns,
      another with which he is angry; the third, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage580E">E</a></span>having many forms, has no
      special name, but is denoted by the general term appetitive, from the
      extraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and drinking
      and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of it; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage581A">581</a></span>also
      money-loving, because such desires are generally satisfied by the help of
      money.
    </p>
<p>
      That is true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">(1) The appetitive:</span>
      If we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were
      concerned with gain, we should then be <span class="pagenum"><a id="page292"></a>292</span> able to fall back on a single
      notion; and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul as
      loving gain or money.
    </p>
<p>
      I agree with you.
    </p>
<p>
      Again, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering
      and getting fame?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage581B">B</a></span>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">(2) The ambitious;</span>
      Suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious—would the term be
      suitable?
    </p>
<p>
      Extremely suitable.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">(3) The principle of knowledge and truth.</span>
      On the other hand, every one sees that the principle of knowledge is
      wholly directed to the truth, and cares less than either of the others for
      gain or fame.
    </p>
<p>
      Far less.
    </p>
<p>
      ‘Lover of wisdom,’ ‘lover of knowledge,’ are titles which we may fitly
      apply to that part of the soul?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      One principle prevails in the souls of one class of men, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage581C">C</a></span>another in
      others, as may happen?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men—lovers
      of wisdom, lovers of honour, lovers of gain?
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p>
      And there are three kinds of pleasure, which are their several objects?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Each will depreciate the others, but only the philosopher has the power to judge,</span>
      Now, if you examine the three classes of men, and ask of them in turn
      which of their lives is pleasantest, each will be found praising his own
      and depreciating that of others: <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage581D">D</a></span>the money-maker will contrast the vanity
      of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages
      of gold and silver?
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And the lover of honour—what will be his opinion? Will he not think
      that the pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning, if
      it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to him?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page293"></a>293</span>

<p><span class="sidenote">because he alone has experience of the highest pleasures and is also acquainted with the lower.</span>
      And are we to suppose<a href="#Footnotebook92" id="FnAnchorbook92" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">2</span></a>, I said, that the philosopher sets <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage581E">E</a></span>any value on
      other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth, and
      in that pursuit abiding, ever learning, not so far indeed from the heaven
      of pleasure? Does he not call the other pleasures necessary, under the
      idea that if there were no necessity for them, he would rather not have
      them?
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook92"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook92" class="pginternal">2</a></span> Reading with Grasere and Hermann <span class="transl" title="ti/ oi)ômetha">τί οἰώμεθα</span>, and omitting <span class="transl" title="ou)de\n">οὐδὲν</span>, which is not
found in the best MSS.</p></div>
<p>
      There can be no doubt of that, he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      Since, then, the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in
      dispute, and the question is not which life is more or <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage582A">582</a></span> less honourable, or
      better or worse, but which is the more pleasant or painless—how
      shall we know who speaks truly?
    </p>
<p>
      I cannot myself tell, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, but what ought to be the criterion? Is any better than experience
      and wisdom and reason?
    </p>
<p>
      There cannot be a better, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, I said, reflect. Of the three individuals, which has the greatest
      experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated? Has the lover of
      gain, in learning the nature of essential truth, greater experience of the
      pleasure of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage582B">B</a></span>knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of gain?
    </p>
<p>
      The philosopher, he replied, has greatly the advantage; for he has of
      necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his childhood
      upwards: but the lover of gain in all his experience has not of necessity
      tasted—or, I should rather say, even had he desired, could hardly
      have tasted—the sweetness of learning and knowing truth.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain, for
      he has a double experience?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage582C">C</a></span>
      Yes, very great.
    </p>
<p>
      Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the lover
      of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?
    </p>
<p>
      Nay, he said, all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their
      object; for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have
      their crowd of admirers, and as they all receive honour they all have
      experience of the pleasures of honour; but the delight which is to be
      found <span class="pagenum"><a id="page294"></a>294</span> in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage582D">D</a></span>
      His experience, then, will enable him to judge better than any one?
    </p>
<p>
      Far better.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The philosopher alone having both judgment and experience,</span>
      And he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Further, the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not
      possessed by the covetous or ambitious man, but only by the philosopher?
    </p>
<p>
      What faculty?
    </p>
<p>
      Reason, with whom, as we were saying, the decision ought to rest.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      If wealth and gain were the criterion, then the praise or <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage582E">E</a></span>blame of the
      lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy?
    </p>
<p>
      Assuredly.
    </p>
<p>
      Or if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgment of the
      ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">the pleasures
which he approves are the true pleasures: he places (1) the love of
wisdom, (2) the love of honour, (3) and lowest the love of gain.</span>
      But since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges—
    </p>
<p>
      The only inference possible, he replied, is that pleasures which are
      approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest.
    </p>
<p>
      And so we arrive at the result, that the pleasure of the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage583A">583</a></span>intelligent part
      of the soul is the pleasantest of the three, and that he of us in whom
      this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life.
    </p>
<p>
      Unquestionably, he said, the wise man speaks with authority when he
      approves of his own life.
    </p>
<p>
      And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the
      pleasure which is next?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour; who is nearer to himself
      than the money-maker.
    </p>
<p>
      Last comes the lover of gain? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page295"></a>295</span>
</p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage583B">B</a></span> <span class="sidenote">True pleasure is not relative but absolute.</span>
      Twice in succession, then, has the just man overthrown the unjust in this
      conflict; and now comes the third trial, which is dedicated to Olympian
      Zeus the saviour: a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that
      of the wise is quite true and pure—all others are a shadow only; and
      surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of falls?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, the greatest; but will you explain yourself?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage583C">C</a></span>
      I will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions.
    </p>
<p>
      Proceed.
    </p>
<p>
      Say, then, is not pleasure opposed to pain?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain?
    </p>
<p>
      There is.
    </p>
<p>
      A state which is intermediate, and a sort of repose of the soul about
      either—that is what you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      You remember what people say when they are sick?
    </p>
<p>
      What do they say?
    </p>
<p>
      That after all nothing is pleasanter than health. But then they never knew
      this to be the greatest of pleasures until <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage583D">D</a></span>they were ill.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I know, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The states intermediate between pleasure and pain are termed pleasures or pains only in relation to their opposites.</span>
      And when persons are suffering from acute pain, you must have heard them
      say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain?
    </p>
<p>
      I have.
    </p>
<p>
      And there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and
      cessation of pain, and not any positive enjoyment, is extolled by them as
      the greatest pleasure?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; at the time they are pleased and well content to be at rest.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage583E">E</a></span>
      Again, when pleasure ceases, that sort of rest or cessation will be
      painful?
    </p>
<p>
      Doubtless, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be
      pain?
    </p>
<p>
      So it would seem. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page296"></a>296</span>
</p>
<p>
      But can that which is neither become both?
    </p>
<p>
      I should say not.
    </p>
<p>
      And both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul, are they not?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage584A">584</a></span> <span class="sidenote">Pleasure and pain are said to be states of rest, but they are really motions.</span>
      But that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion,
      and in a mean between them?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      How, then, can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is
      pleasure, or that the absence of pleasure is pain?
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      This then is an appearance only and not a reality; that is to say, the
      rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful, and
      painful in comparison of what is pleasant; but all these representations,
      when tried by the test of true pleasure, are not real but a sort of
      imposition?
    </p>
<p>
      That is the inference.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage584B">B</a></span> <span class="sidenote">All pleasures are not merely cessations of pains, or pains of pleasures; e.g. the pleasures of smell are not.</span>
      Look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains and
      you will no longer suppose, as you perhaps may at present, that pleasure
      is only the cessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.
    </p>
<p>
      What are they, he said, and where shall I find them?
    </p>
<p>
      There are many of them: take as an example the pleasures of smell, which
      are very great and have no antecedent pains; they come in a moment, and
      when they depart leave no pain behind them.
    </p>
<p>
      Most true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage584C">C</a></span>
      Let us not, then, be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the
      cessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.
    </p>
<p>
      No.
    </p>
<p>
      Still, the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul
      through the body are generally of this sort—they are reliefs of
      pain.
    </p>
<p>
      That is true.
    </p>
<p>
      And the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like nature?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage584D">D</a></span>
      Shall I give you an illustration of them?
    </p>
<p>
      Let me hear. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page297"></a>297</span>
</p>
<p>
      You would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower and
      middle region?
    </p>
<p>
      I should.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Illustrations of the unreality of certain pleasures.</span>
      And if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region, would he
      not imagine that he is going up; and he who is standing in the middle and
      sees whence he has come, would imagine that he is already in the upper
      region, if he has never seen the true upper world?
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure, he said; how can he think otherwise?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage584E">E</a></span>
      But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine, that
      he was descending?
    </p>
<p>
      No doubt.
    </p>
<p>
      All that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle and
      lower regions?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Then can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth, as
      they have wrong ideas about many other things, should also have wrong
      ideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state; so that when
      they are only being <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage585A">585</a></span>drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think the
      pain which they experience to be real, and in like manner, when drawn away
      from pain to the neutral or intermediate state, they firmly believe that
      they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure; they, not knowing
      pleasure, err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain, which is like
      contrasting black with grey instead of white—can you wonder, I say,
      at this?
    </p>
<p>
      No, indeed; I should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite.
    </p>
<p>
      Look at the matter thus:—Hunger, thirst, and the like, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage585B">B</a></span>are
      inanitions of the bodily state?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The intellectual more real than the sensual.</span>
      And is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that
      which has more existence the truer?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly, from that which has more.
    </p>
<p>
      What classes of things have a greater share of pure <span class="pagenum"><a id="page298"></a>298</span> existence in your
      judgment—those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds
      of sustenance are examples, or the class which contains true opinion and
      knowledge and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage585C">C</a></span>mind and all the different kinds of virtue? Put the question
      in this way:—Which has a more pure being—that which is
      concerned with the invariable, the immortal, and the true, and is of such
      a nature, and is found in such natures; or that which is concerned with
      and found in the variable and mortal, and is itself variable and mortal?
    </p>
<p>
      Far purer, he replied, is the being of that which is concerned with the
      invariable.
    </p>
<p>
      And does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same
      degree as of essence?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, of knowledge in the same degree.
    </p>
<p>
      And of truth in the same degree?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of
      essence?
    </p>
<p>
      Necessarily.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage585D">D</a></span>
      Then, in general, those kinds of things which are in the service of the
      body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service of
      the soul?
    </p>
<p>
      Far less.
    </p>
<p>
      And has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      What is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more real
      existence, is more really filled than that which is filled with less real
      existence and is less real?
    </p>
<p>
      Of course.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The pleasures of the sensual and also of the passionate element are unreal and mixed.</span>
      And if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according to
      nature, that which is more really filled with <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage585E">E</a></span>more real being will more
      really and truly enjoy true pleasure; whereas that which participates in
      less real being will be less truly and surely satisfied, and will
      participate in an illusory and less real pleasure?
    </p>
<p>
      Unquestionably.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage586A">586</a></span>
      Those then who know not wisdom and virtue, and are always busy with
      gluttony and sensuality, go down and up again as far as the mean; and in
      this region they move at <span class="pagenum"><a id="page299"></a>299</span> random throughout life, but they never pass into
      the true upper world; thither they neither look, nor do they ever find
      their way, neither are they truly filled with true being, nor do they
      taste of pure and abiding pleasure. Like cattle, with their eyes always
      looking down and their heads stooping to the earth, that is, to the
      dining-table, they fatten and feed <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage586B">B</a></span>and breed, and, in their excessive love
      of these delights, they kick and butt at one another with horns and hoofs
      which are made of iron; and they kill one another by reason of their
      insatiable lust. For they fill themselves with that which is not
      substantial, and the part of themselves which they fill is also
      unsubstantial and incontinent.
    </p>
<p>
      Verily, Socrates, said Glaucon, you describe the life of the many like an
      oracle.
    </p>
<p>
      Their pleasures are mixed with pains—how can they be otherwise? For
      they are mere shadows and pictures of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage586C">C</a></span>the true, and are coloured by
      contrast, which exaggerates both light and shade, and so they implant in
      the minds of fools insane desires of themselves; and they are fought about
      as Stesichorus says that the Greeks fought about the shadow of Helen at
      Troy in ignorance of the truth.
    </p>
<p>
      Something of that sort must inevitably happen.
    </p>
<p>
      And must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element of
      the soul? Will not the passionate man who carries his passion into action,
      be in the like case, whether he is envious and ambitious, or violent and
      contentious, or angry and discontented, if he be seeking to attain <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage586D">D</a></span>honour
      and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without reason or sense?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, the same will happen with the spirited element also.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Both kinds of pleasures are attained in the highest degree when the desires which seek them are under the guidance of reason.</span>
      Then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour,
      when they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of
      reason and knowledge, and pursue after and win the pleasures which wisdom
      shows them, will also have the truest pleasures in the highest degree
      which is attainable to them, inasmuch as they follow truth; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage586E">E</a></span>and they will
      have the pleasures which are natural to them, if that which is best for
      each one is also most natural to him?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, certainly; the best is the most natural. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page300"></a>300</span>
</p>
<p>
      And when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle, and there is
      no division, the several parts are just, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage587A">587</a></span>and do each of them their own
      business, and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which they
      are capable?
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p>
      But when either of the two other principles prevails, it fails in
      attaining its own pleasure, and compels the rest to pursue after a
      pleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and
      reason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance
      from law and order?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      And the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage587B">B</a></span>greatest
      distance?</p>
<p>Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And the royal and orderly desires are nearest?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural
      pleasure, and the king at the least?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      But if so, the tyrant will live most unpleasantly, and the king most
      pleasantly?
    </p>
<p>
      Inevitably.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The measure of the interval which separates the king from the tyrant,</span>
      Would you know the measure of the interval which separates them?
    </p>
<p>
      Will you tell me?
    </p>
<p>
      There appear to be three pleasures, one genuine and two <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage587C">C</a></span>spurious: now the
      transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious; he has
      run away from the region of law and reason, and taken up his abode with
      certain slave pleasures which are his satellites, and the measure of his
      inferiority can only be expressed in a figure.
    </p>
<p>
      How do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      I assume, I said, that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch;
      the democrat was in the middle? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page301"></a>301</span>
</p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And if there is truth in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an image
      of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of the
      oligarch?
    </p>
<p>
      He will.
    </p>
<p>
      And the oligarch is third from the royal; since we count <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage587D">D</a></span>as one royal and
      aristocratical?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he is third.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number
      which is three times three?
    </p>
<p>
      Manifestly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">expressed under the symbol of a cube corresponding to the number 729.</span>
      The shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of length
      will be a plane figure.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And if you raise the power and make the plane a solid, there is no
      difficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is
      parted from the king.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes; the arithmetician will easily do the sum.
    </p>
<p>
      Or if some person begins at the other end and measures <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage587E">E</a></span>the interval by
      which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure, he will
      find him, when the multiplication is completed, living 729 times more
      pleasantly, and the tyrant more painfully by this same interval.
    </p>
<p>
      What a wonderful calculation! And how enormous is the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage588A">588</a></span>distance which
      separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain!
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">which is <em>nearly</em> the number of days and nights in a year.</span>
      Yet a true calculation, I said, and a number which nearly concerns human
      life, if human beings are concerned with days and nights and months and
      years<a href="#Footnotebook93" id="FnAnchorbook93" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">3</span></a>.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook93"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook93" class="pginternal">3</a></span> 729 <em>nearly</em> equals the number of days and nights in the year.</p></div>
<p>
      Yes, he said, human life is certainly concerned with them.
    </p>
<p>
      Then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil and
      unjust, his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of life
      and in beauty and virtue?
    </p>
<p>
      Immeasurably greater.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage588B">B</a></span> <span class="sidenote">Refutation of Thrasymachus.</span>
      Well, I said, and now having arrived at this stage of the argument, we may
      revert to the words which brought us hither: Was not some one saying that
      injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed to be just?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, that was said. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page302"></a>302</span>
</p>
<p>
      Now then, having determined the power and quality of justice and
      injustice, let us have a little conversation with him.
    </p>
<p>
      What shall we say to him?
    </p>
<p>
      Let us make an image of the soul, that he may have his own words presented
      before his eyes.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage588C">C</a></span>
      Of what sort?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The triple animal who has outwardly the image of a man.</span>
      An ideal image of the soul, like the composite creations of ancient
      mythology, such as the Chimera or Scylla or Cerberus, and there are many
      others in which two or more different natures are said to grow into one.
    </p>
<p>
      There are said of have been such unions.
    </p>
<p>
      Then do you now model the form of a multitudinous, many-headed monster,
      having a ring of heads of all manner of beasts, tame and wild, which he is
      able to generate and metamorphose at will.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage588D">D</a></span>
      You suppose marvellous powers in the artist; but, as language is more
      pliable than wax or any similar substance, let there be such a model as
      you propose.
    </p>
<p>
      Suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion, and a third of a
      man, the second smaller than the first, and the third smaller than the
      second.
    </p>
<p>
      That, he said, is an easier task; and I have made them as you say.
    </p>
<p>
      And now join them, and let the three grow into one.
    </p>
<p>
      That has been accomplished.
    </p>
<p>
      Next fashion the outside of them into a single image, as of a man, so that
      he who is not able to look within, and sees <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage588E">E</a></span>only the outer hull, may
      believe the beast to be a single human creature.
    </p>
<p>
      I have done so, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Will any one say that we should strengthen the monster and the lion at the expense of the man?</span>
      And now, to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human creature
      to be unjust, and unprofitable to be just, let us reply that, if he be
      right, it is profitable for this creature to feast the multitudinous
      monster and strengthen the lion and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage589A">589</a></span>the lion-like qualities, but to starve
      and weaken the man, who is consequently liable to be dragged about at the
      mercy of either of the other two; and he is not to attempt to familiarize
      or harmonize them with one another—he ought rather to suffer them to
      fight and bite and devour one another. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page303"></a>303</span>
</p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said; that is what the approver of injustice says.
    </p>
<p>
      To him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so speak
      and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the most
      complete mastery over the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage589B">B</a></span>entire human creature. He should watch over the
      many-headed monster like a good husbandman, fostering and cultivating the
      gentle qualities, and preventing the wild ones from growing; he should be
      making the lion-heart his ally, and in common care of them all should be
      uniting the several parts with one another and with himself.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that is quite what the maintainer of justice say.
    </p>
<p>
      And so from every point of view, whether of pleasure, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage589C">C</a></span>honour, or
      advantage, the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth, and the
      disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, from every point of view.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">For the noble principle subjects the beast to the man, the ignoble the man to the beast.</span>
      Come, now, and let us gently reason with the unjust, who is not
      intentionally in error. ‘Sweet Sir,’ we will say to him, ‘what think you
      of things esteemed noble and ignoble? <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage589D">D</a></span>Is not the noble that which subjects
      the beast to the man, or rather to the god in man; and the ignoble that
      which subjects the man to the beast?’ He can hardly avoid saying Yes—can
      he now?
    </p>
<p>
      Not if he has any regard for my opinion.
    </p>
<p>
      But, if he agree so far, we may ask him to answer another question: ‘Then
      how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the condition
      that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst? <span class="sidenote">A man would not be the gainer if he sold his child: how much worse to sell his soul!</span>Who can
      imagine that a man who <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage589E">E</a></span>sold his son or daughter into slavery for money,
      especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men, would be
      the gainer, however large might be the sum which he received? And will any
      one say that he is not a miserable <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage590A">590</a></span>caitiff who remorselessly sells his own
      divine being to that which is most godless and detestable? Eriphyle took
      the necklace as the price of her husband’s life, but he is taking a bribe
      in order to compass a worse ruin.’
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, said Glaucon, far worse—I will answer for him.
    </p>
<p>
      Has not the intemperate been censured of old, because in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page304"></a>304</span> him the huge
      multiform monster is allowed to be too much at large?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Proofs:–(1) Men are blamed for the predominance of the lower nature,</span>
      And men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage590B">B</a></span>lion and serpent
      element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And luxury and softness are blamed, because they relax and weaken this
      same creature, and make a coward of him?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates the
      spirited animal to the unruly monster, and, for the sake of money, of
      which he can never have enough, habituates him in the days of his youth to
      be trampled in the mire, and from being a lion to become a monkey?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage590C">C</a></span><span class="sidenote">as well as for the meanness of their employments and character:</span>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach? Only because they
      imply a natural weakness of the higher principle; the individual is unable
      to control the creatures within him, but has to court them, and his great
      study is how to flatter them.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">(2) It is admitted
 that every one should be the servant of a divine rule, or at any rate
be kept under control by an external authority:</span>
      Such appears to be the reason.
    </p>
<p>
      And therefore, being desirous of placing him under a rule like that of the
      best, we say that he ought to be the servant <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage590D">D</a></span>of the best, in whom the
      Divine rules; not, as Thrasymachus supposed, to the injury of the servant,
      but because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom dwelling within
      him; or, if this be impossible, then by an external authority, in order
      that we may be all, as far as possible, under the same government, friends
      and equals.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage590E">E</a></span>
      And this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law, which is the ally
      of the whole city; and is seen also in the authority which we exercise
      over children,  <span class="sidenote">(3) The care taken of children shows that we seek to establish in them a higher principle.</span>and the refusal to let them be free until we have
      established in them a principle analogous to the constitution of a state,
      and by <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage591A">591</a></span>cultivation of this higher element have set up in their hearts a
      guardian and ruler like our own, and when this is done they may go their
      ways.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, the purpose of the law is manifest. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page305"></a>305</span>
</p>
<p>
      From what point of view, then, and on what ground can we say that a man is
      profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness, which will make
      him a worse man, even though he acquire money or power by his wickedness?
    </p>
<p>
      From no point of view at all.
    </p>
<p>
      What shall he profit, if his injustice be undetected and unpunished? <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage591B">B</a></span>He
      who is undetected only gets worse, whereas he who is detected and punished
      has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized; the gentler
      element in him is liberated, <span class="sidenote">The wise man will
employ his energies in freeing and harmonizing the nobler elements of
his nature and in regulating his bodily habits.</span>and his whole soul is perfected and ennobled
      by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom, more than the
      body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty, strength and health, in
      proportion as the soul is more honourable than the body.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage591C">C</a></span>
      To this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the energies
      of his life. And in the first place, he will honour studies which impress
      these qualities on his soul and will disregard others?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">His first aim not health but harmony of soul.</span>
      In the next place, he will regulate his bodily habit and training, and so
      far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures, that he
      will regard even health as quite a secondary matter; his first object will
      be not that he may <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage591D">D</a></span>be fair or strong or well, unless he is likely thereby
      to gain temperance, but he will always desire so to attemper the body as
      to preserve the harmony of the soul?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly he will, if he has true music in him.
    </p>
<p>
      And in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and harmony
      which he will also observe; he will not allow himself to be dazzled by the
      foolish applause of the world, and heap up riches to his own infinite
      harm?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage591E">E</a></span> <span class="sidenote">He will not heap up riches,</span>
      He will look at the city which is within him, and take heed that no
      disorder occur in it, such as might arise either from superfluity or from
      want; and upon this principle he will regulate his property and gain or
      spend according to his means.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">and he will only accept such political honours as will not deteriorate his character.</span>
      And, for the same reason, he will gladly accept and enjoy <span class="pagenum"><a id="page306"></a>306</span> <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage592A">592</a></span>such honours as
      he deems likely to make him a better man; but those, whether private or
      public, which are likely to disorder his life, he will avoid?
    </p>
<p>
      Then, if that is his motive, he will not be a statesman.
    </p>
<p>
      By the dog of Egypt, he will! in the city which is his own he certainly
      will, though in the land of his birth perhaps not, unless he have a divine
      call.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">He has a city of his own, and the ideal pattern of this will be the law of his life.</span>
      I understand; you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we are
      the founders, and which exists in idea only; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage592B">B</a></span>for I do not believe that
      there is such an one anywhere on earth?
    </p>
<p>
      In heaven, I replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks, which he
      who desires may behold, and beholding, may set his own house in order<a href="#Footnotebook94" id="FnAnchorbook94" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">4</span></a>. But
      whether such an one exists, or ever will exist in fact, is no matter; for
      he will live after the manner of that city, having nothing to do with any
      other.

      poetry.
    </p>
<p>
      To what do you refer?
    </p>
<p>
      To the rejection of imitative poetry, which certainly ought not to be
      received; as I see far more clearly now that <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage595B">B</a></span> the parts of the soul have
      been distinguished.
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Poetical imitations are ruinous to the mind of the hearer.</span>
      Speaking in confidence, for I should not like to have my words repeated to
      the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe—but I do not mind
      saying to you, that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the
      understanding of the hearers, and that the knowledge of their true nature
      is the only antidote to them.
    </p>
<p>
      Explain the purport of your remark.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, I will tell you, although I have always from my earliest youth had
      an awe and love of Homer, which even now makes the words falter on my
      lips, for he is the great <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage595C">C</a></span>captain and teacher of the whole of that
      charming tragic company; but a man is not to be reverenced more than the
      truth, and therefore I will speak out.
    </p>
<p>
      Very good, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Listen to me then, or rather, answer me.
    </p>
<p>
      Put your question.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The nature of imitation.</span>
      Can you tell me what imitation is? for I really do not know.
    </p>
<p>
      A likely thing, then, that I should know.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage596A">596</a></span>
      Why not? for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the keener.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said; but in your presence, even if I had any <span class="pagenum"><a id="page308"></a>308</span> faint notion,
      I could not muster courage to utter it. Will you enquire yourself?
    </p>
<p>
      Well then, shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner: Whenever a
      number of individuals have a common name, we assume them to have also a
      corresponding idea or form:—do you understand me?
    </p>
<p>
      I do.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The idea is one, but the objects comprehended under it are many.</span>
      Let us take any common instance; there are beds and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage596B">B</a></span>tables in the world—plenty
      of them, are there not?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      But there are only two ideas or forms of them—one the idea of a bed,
      the other of a table.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our
      use, in accordance with the idea—that is our way of speaking in this
      and similar instances—but no artificer makes the ideas themselves:
      how could he?
    </p>
<p>
      Impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      And there is another artist,—I should like to know what you would
      say of him.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage596C">C</a></span>
      Who is he?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The universal
creator an extraordinary person. But note also that everybody is a
creator in a sense. For all things may be made by the reflection of them
 in a mirror.</span>
      One who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen.
    </p>
<p>
      What an extraordinary man!
    </p>
<p>
      Wait a little, and there will be more reason for your saying so. For this
      is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind, but plants and
      animals, himself and all other things—the earth and heaven, and the
      things which are in heaven or under the earth; he makes the gods also.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage596D">D</a></span>
      He must be a wizard and no mistake.
    </p>
<p>
      Oh! you are incredulous, are you? Do you mean that there is no such maker
      or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these
      things but in another not? Do you see that there is a way in which you
      could make them all yourself?
    </p>
<p>
      What way?
    </p>
<p>
      An easy way enough; or rather, there are many ways in which the feat might
      be quickly and easily accomplished, none quicker than that of turning a
      mirror round and round—you <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage596E">E</a></span>would soon enough make the sun and the
      heavens, and the earth and yourself, and other animals and plants, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page309"></a>309</span> all
      the other things of which we were just now speaking, in the mirror.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; but they would be appearances only.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">But this is an appearance only: and the painter too is a maker of appearances.</span>
      Very good, I said, you are coming to the point now. And the painter too
      is, as I conceive, just such another—a creator of appearances, is he
      not?
    </p>
<p>
      Of course.
    </p>
<p>
      But then I suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue. And yet
      there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, but not a real bed.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage597A">597</a></span>
      And what of the maker of the bed? were you not saying that he too makes,
      not the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of the bed, but
      only a particular bed?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I did.
    </p>
<p>
      Then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true existence,
      but only some semblance of existence; and if any one were to say that the
      work of the maker of the bed, or of any other workman, has real existence,
      he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth.
    </p>
<p>
      At any rate, he replied, philosophers would say that he was not speaking
      the truth.
    </p>
<p>
      No wonder, then, that his work too is an indistinct expression of truth.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage597B">B</a></span>
      No wonder.
    </p>
<p>
      Suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who
      this imitator is?
    </p>
<p>
      If you please.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Three beds and three makers of beds.</span>
      Well then, here are three beds: one existing in nature, which is made by
      God, as I think that we may say—for no one else can be the maker?
    </p>
<p>
      No.
    </p>
<p>
      There is another which is the work of the carpenter?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      And the work of the painter is a third?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Beds, then, are of three kinds, and there are three artists who
      superintend them: God, the maker of the bed, and the painter?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, there are three of them. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page310"></a>310</span>
</p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage597C">C</a></span>
      God, whether from choice or from necessity, made one bed in nature and one
      only; two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever will be
      made by God.
    </p>
<p>
      Why is that?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">(1) The creator. God could only make one bed; if he made two, a third would still appear behind them.</span>
      Because even if He had made but two, a third would still appear behind
      them which both of them would have for their idea, and that would be the
      ideal bed and not the two others.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage597D">D</a></span>
      God knew this, and He desired to be the real maker of a real bed, not a
      particular maker of a particular bed, and therefore He created a bed which
      is essentially and by nature one only.
    </p>
<p>
      So we believe.
    </p>
<p>
      Shall we, then, speak of Him as the natural author or maker of the bed?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he replied; inasmuch as by the natural process of creation He is the
      author of this and of all other things.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">(2) The human maker.</span>
      And what shall we say of the carpenter—is not he also the maker of
      the bed?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      But would you call the painter a creator and maker?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage597E">E</a></span> <span class="sidenote">(3) The imitator, i.e. the painter or poet,</span>
      I think, he said, that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of that
      which the others make.
    </p>
<p>
      Good, I said; then you call him who is third in the descent from nature an
      imitator?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And the tragic poet is an imitator, and therefore, like all other
      imitators, he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth?
    </p>
<p>
      That appears to be so.
    </p>
<p>
      Then about the imitator we are agreed. And what about <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage598A">598</a></span>the painter?—I
      would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which
      originally exists in nature, or only the creations of artists?
    </p>
<p>
      The latter.
    </p>
<p>
      As they are or as they appear? you have still to determine this. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page311"></a>311</span>
</p>
<p>
      What do you mean?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">whose art is one of imitation or appearance and a long way removed from the truth.</span>
      I mean, that you may look at a bed from different points of view,
      obliquely or directly or from any other point of view, and the bed will
      appear different, but there is no difference in reality. And the same of
      all things.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, the difference is only apparent.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage598B">B</a></span>
      Now let me ask you another question: Which is the art of painting designed
      to be—an imitation of things as they are, or as they appear—of
      appearance or of reality?
    </p>
<p>
      Of appearance.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Any one who does all things does only a very small part of them.</span>
      Then the imitator, I said, is a long way off the truth, and can do all
      things because he lightly touches on a small part of them, and that part
      an image. For example: A painter will paint a cobbler, carpenter, or any
      other artist, though he <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage598C">C</a></span>knows nothing of their arts; and, if he is a good
      artist, he may deceive children or simple persons, when he shows them his
      picture of a carpenter from a distance, and they will fancy that they are
      looking at a real carpenter.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Any one who pretends to know all things is ignorant of the very nature of knowledge.</span>
      And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all the
      arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing with
      a higher degree of accuracy <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage598D">D</a></span>than any other man—whoever tells us
      this, I think that we can only imagine him to be a simple creature who is
      likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and whom
      he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyse the
      nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation.
    </p>
<p>
      Most true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">And he who attributes such universal knowledge to the poets is similarly deceived.</span>
      And so, when we hear persons saying that the tragedians, and Homer, who is
      at their head, know all the arts and all <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage598E">E</a></span>things human, virtue as well as
      vice, and divine things too, for that the good poet cannot compose well
      unless he knows his subject, and that he who has not this knowledge can
      never be a poet, we ought to consider whether here also there may not be a
      similar illusion. Perhaps they may have come across imitators and been
      deceived by them; they may not have remembered when they saw their works
      that <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage599A">599</a></span>these were but imitations thrice removed from the truth, and could
      easily be made without any knowledge of the truth, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page312"></a>312</span> because they are
      appearances only and not realities? Or, after all, they may be in the
      right, and poets do really know the things about which they seem to the
      many to speak so well?
    </p>
<p>
      The question, he said, should by all means be considered.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">He who could make the original would not make the image.</span>
      Now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as well
      as the image, he would seriously devote himself to the image-making
      branch? Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life,
      as if he had <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage599B">B</a></span>nothing higher in him?
    </p>
<p>
      I should say not.
    </p>
<p>
      The real artist, who knew what he was imitating, would be interested in
      realities and not in imitations; and would desire to leave as memorials of
      himself works many and fair; and, instead of being the author of
      encomiums, he would prefer to be the theme of them.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that would be to him a source of much greater honour and
      profit.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">If Homer had been a legislator, or general, or inventor,</span>
      Then, I said, we must put a question to Homer; not about <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage599C">C</a></span>medicine, or any
      of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer: we are not going
      to ask him, or any other poet, whether he has cured patients like
      Asclepius, or left behind him a school of medicine such as the Asclepiads
      were, or whether he only talks about medicine and other arts at
      second-hand; but we have a right to know respecting military tactics,
      politics, education, which are the chiefest <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage599D">D</a></span>and noblest subjects of his
      poems, and we may fairly ask him about them. ‘Friend Homer,’ then we say
      to him, ‘if you are only in the second remove from truth in what you say
      of virtue, and not in the third—not an image maker or imitator—and
      if you are able to discern what pursuits make men better or worse in
      private or public life, tell us what State was ever better governed by
      your help? The good <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage599E">E</a></span>order of Lacedaemon is due to Lycurgus, and many other
      cities great and small have been similarly benefited by others; but who
      says that you have been a good legislator to them and have done them any
      good? Italy and Sicily boast of Charondas, and there is Solon who is
      renowned among us; but what city has anything to say about you?’ Is there
      any city which he might name?
    </p>
<p>
      I think not, said Glaucon; not even the Homerids themselves pretend that
      he was a legislator. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page313"></a>313</span>
</p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage600A">600</a></span>
      Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by
      him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?
    </p>
<p>
      There is not.
    </p>
<p>
      Or is there any invention<a href="#Footnotebook101" id="FnAnchorbook101" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">1</span></a> of his, applicable to the arts or to human life,
      such as Thales the Milesian or Anacharsis the Scythian, and other
      ingenious men have conceived, which is attributed to him?
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook101"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook101" class="pginternal">1</a></span> Omitting <span class="transl" title="ei)s">εἰς</span>.</p></div>
<p>
      There is absolutely nothing of the kind.
    </p>
<p>
      But, if Homer never did any public service, was he privately a guide or
      teacher of any? Had he in his lifetime friends <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage600B">B</a></span>who loved to associate with
      him, and who handed down to posterity an Homeric way of life, such as was
      established by Pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his wisdom, and
      whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the order which was
      named after him?
    </p>
<p>
      Nothing of the kind is recorded of him. For surely, Socrates, Creophylus,
      the companion of Homer, that child of flesh, whose name always makes us
      laugh, might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity, if, as is said,
      Homer was <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage600C">C</a></span>greatly neglected by him and others in his own day when he was
      alive?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">or had done anything else for the improvement of mankind, he would not have been allowed to starve.</span>
      Yes, I replied, that is the tradition. But can you imagine, Glaucon, that
      if Homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind—if he
      had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator—can you
      imagine, I say, that he would not have had many followers, and been
      honoured and loved by them? Protagoras of Abdera, and Prodicus of Ceos,
      and a host of others, have only to whisper to their contemporaries: <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage600D">D</a></span>‘You
      will never be able to manage either your own house or your own State until
      you appoint us to be your ministers of education’—and this ingenious
      device of theirs has such an effect in making men love them that their
      companions all but carry them about on their shoulders. And is it
      conceivable that the contemporaries of Homer, or again of Hesiod, would
      have allowed either of them to go about as rhapsodists, if they had really
      been able to make mankind virtuous? Would they not have been as unwilling
      to part with them as with gold, and have compelled them to stay <span class="pagenum"><a id="page314"></a>314</span> <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage600E">E</a></span>at home
      with them? Or, if the master would not stay, then the disciples would have
      followed him about everywhere, until they had got education enough?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, Socrates, that, I think, is quite true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The poets, like the painters, are but imitators;</span>
      Then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals, beginning with
      Homer, are only imitators; they copy images <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage601A">601</a></span>of virtue and the like, but
      the truth they never reach? The poet is like a painter who, as we have
      already observed, will make a likeness of a cobbler though he understands
      nothing of cobbling; and his picture is good enough for those who know no
      more than he does, and judge only by colours and figures.
    </p>
<p>
      Quite so.
    </p>
<p>
      In like manner the poet with his words and phrases<a href="#Footnotebook102" id="FnAnchorbook102" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">2</span></a> may be said to lay on
      the colours of the several arts, himself understanding their nature only
      enough to imitate them; and other people, who are as ignorant as he is,
      and judge only from his words, imagine that if he speaks of cobbling, or
      of military tactics, or of anything else, in metre and harmony <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage601B">B</a></span>and rhythm,
      he speaks very well—such is the sweet influence which melody and
      rhythm by nature have. And I think that you must have observed again and
      again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make when stripped of the
      colours which music puts upon them, and recited in simple prose.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook102"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook102" class="pginternal">2</a></span>Or, ‘with his nouns and verbs.’</p></div>
<p>
      Yes, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      They are like faces which were never really beautiful, but only blooming;
      and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them?
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">they know nothing of true existence.</span>
      Here is another point: The imitator or maker of the image knows nothing of
      true existence; he knows appearances only. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage601C">C</a></span>Am I not right?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Then let us have a clear understanding, and not be satisfied with half an
      explanation.
    </p>
<p>
      Proceed.
    </p>
<p>
      Of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a bit?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page315"></a>315</span>
</p>
<p>
      And the worker in leather and brass will make them?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The maker has more knowledge than the imitator, but less than the user. Three arts, using, making, imitating.</span>
      But does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins? Nay, hardly
      even the workers in brass and leather who make them; only the horseman who
      knows how to use them—he knows their right form.
    </p>
<p>
      Most true.
    </p>
<p>
      And may we not say the same of all things?
    </p>
<p>
      What?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage601D">D</a></span>
      That there are three arts which are concerned with all things: one which
      uses, another which makes, a third which imitates them?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Goodness of things relative to use; hence the maker of them is instructed by the user.</span>
      And the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure, animate or
      inanimate, and of every action of man, is relative to the use for which
      nature or the artist has intended them.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them, and he
      must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop
      themselves in use; for example, the flute-player will tell the flute-maker
      which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer; he will tell him how
      he ought <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage601E">E</a></span>to make them, and the other will attend to his instructions?
    </p>
<p>
      Of course.
    </p>
<p>
      The one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and
      badness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do what he is
      told by him?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The maker has belief and not knowledge, the imitator neither.</span>
      The instrument is the same, but about the excellence or badness of it the
      maker will only attain to a correct belief; and this he will gain from him
      who knows, by talking to him <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage602A">602</a></span>and being compelled to hear what he has to
      say, whereas the user will have knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      But will the imitator have either? Will he know from use whether or no his
      drawing is correct or beautiful? or will he have right opinion from being
      compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him instructions
      about what he should draw? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page316"></a>316</span>
</p>
<p>
      Neither.
    </p>
<p>
      Then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about
      the goodness or badness of his imitations?
    </p>
<p>
      I suppose not.
    </p>
<p>
      The imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about
      his own creations?
    </p>
<p>
      Nay, very much the reverse.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage602B">B</a></span>
      And still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing good
      or bad, and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which appears
      to be good to the ignorant multitude?
    </p>
<p>
      Just so.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no knowledge
      worth mentioning of what he imitates. Imitation is only a kind of play or
      sport, and the tragic poets, whether they write in Iambic or in Heroic
      verse, are imitators in the highest degree?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage602C">C</a></span> <span class="sidenote">Imitation has been proved to be thrice removed from the truth.</span>
      And now tell me, I conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us to be
      concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed?
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      I will explain: The body which is large when seen near, appears small when
      seen at a distance?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water, and
      crooked when in the water; and the concave becomes convex, owing to the
      illusion about colours to which the sight is liable. Thus every sort of
      confusion is revealed within us; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage602D">D</a></span>and this is that weakness of the human
      mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light and shadow
      and other ingenious devices imposes, having an effect upon us like magic.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The art of measuring given to man that he may correct the variety of appearances.</span>
      And the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue of
      the human understanding—there <span class="pagenum"><a id="page317"></a>317</span> is the beauty of them—and the
      apparent greater or less, or more or heavier, no longer have the mastery
      over us, but give way before calculation and measure and weight?
    </p>
<p>
      Most true.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage602E">E</a></span>
      And this, surely, must be the work of the calculating and rational
      principle in the soul?
    </p>
<p>
      To be sure.
    </p>
<p>
      And when this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal,
      or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an apparent
      contradiction?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      But were we not saying that such a contradiction is impossible—the
      same faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same
      thing?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage603A">603</a></span>
      Then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is not
      the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      And the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to
      measure and calculation?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the
      soul?
    </p>
<p>
      No doubt.
    </p>
<p>
      This was the conclusion at which I was seeking to arrive when I said that
      painting or drawing, and imitation in general, when doing their own proper
      work, are far removed from truth, and the companions and friends and
      associates of <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage603B">B</a></span>a principle within us which is equally removed from reason,
      and that they have no true or healthy aim.
    </p>
<p>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The productions of the imitative arts are bastard and illegitimate.</span>
      The imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior, and has inferior
      offspring.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And is this confined to the sight only, or does it extend to the hearing
      also, relating in fact to what we term poetry?
    </p>
<p>
      Probably the same would be true of poetry.
    </p>
<p>
      Do not rely, I said, on a probability derived from the analogy of
      painting; but let us examine further and see <span class="pagenum"><a id="page318"></a>318</span> <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage603C">C</a></span>whether the faculty with
      which poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad.
    </p>
<p>
      By all means.
    </p>
<p>
      We may state the question thus:—Imitation imitates the actions of
      men, whether voluntary or involuntary, on which, as they imagine, a good
      or bad result has ensued, and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly. Is there
      anything more?
    </p>
<p>
      No, there is nothing else.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">They imitate opposites;</span>
      But in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage603D">D</a></span>with himself—or
      rather, as in the instance of sight there was confusion and opposition in
      his opinions about the same things, so here also is there not strife and
      inconsistency in his life? Though I need hardly raise the question again,
      for I remember that all this has been already admitted; and the soul has
      been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar
      oppositions occurring at the same moment?
    </p>
<p>
      And we were right, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, thus far we were right; but there was an <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage603E">E</a></span>omission which must
      now be supplied.
    </p>
<p>
      What was the omission?
    </p>
<p>
      Were we not saying that a good man, who has the misfortune to lose his son
      or anything else which is most dear to him, will bear the loss with more
      equanimity than another?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">they encourage weakness;</span>
      But will he have no sorrow, or shall we say that although he cannot help
      sorrowing, he will moderate his sorrow?
    </p>
<p>
      The latter, he said, is the truer statement.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage604A">604</a></span>
      Tell me: will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his
      sorrow when he is seen by his equals, or when he is alone?
    </p>
<p>
      It will make a great difference whether he is seen or not.
    </p>
<p>
      When he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things which
      he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      There is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist, as
      well as a feeling of his misfortune which is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage604B">B</a></span>forcing him to indulge his
      sorrow? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page319"></a>319</span>
</p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      But when a man is drawn in two opposite directions, to and from the same
      object, this, as we affirm, necessarily implies two distinct principles in
      him?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      One of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law?
    </p>
<p>
      How do you mean?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">they are at variance with the exhortations of philosophy;</span>
      The law would say that to be patient under suffering is best, and that we
      should not give way to impatience, as there is no knowing whether such
      things are good or evil; and nothing is gained by impatience; also,
      because no human <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage604C">C</a></span>thing is of serious importance, and grief stands in the
      way of that which at the moment is most required.
    </p>
<p>
      What is most required? he asked.
    </p>
<p>
      That we should take counsel about what has happened, and when the dice
      have been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best;
      not, like children who have had a fall, keeping hold of the part struck
      and wasting time in setting up a howl, but always accustoming the soul
      forthwith <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage604D">D</a></span>to apply a remedy, raising up that which is sickly and fallen,
      banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said; and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion
      of reason?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">they recall trouble and sorrow;</span>
      And the other principle, which inclines us to recollection of our troubles
      and to lamentation, and can never have enough of them, we may call
      irrational, useless, and cowardly?
    </p>
<p>
      Indeed, we may.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage604E">E</a></span>
      And does not the latter—I mean the rebellious principle—furnish
      a great variety of materials for imitation? Whereas the wise and calm
      temperament, being always nearly equable, is not easy to imitate or to
      appreciate when imitated, especially at a public festival when a
      promiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre. For the feeling represented
      is one to which they are strangers.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage605A">605</a></span>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not <span class="pagenum"><a id="page320"></a>320</span> by nature made,
      nor is his art intended, to please or to affect the rational principle in
      the soul; but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper, which is
      easily imitated?
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">they minister in an inferior manner to an inferior principle in the soul.</span>
      And now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter,
      for he is like him in two ways: first, inasmuch as his creations have an
      inferior degree of truth—in this, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage605B">B</a></span>I say, he is like him; and he is
      also like him in being concerned with an inferior part of the soul; and
      therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him into a well-ordered
      State, because he awakens and nourishes and strengthens the feelings and
      impairs the reason. As in a city when the evil are permitted to have
      authority and the good are put out of the way, so in the soul of man, as
      we maintain, the imitative poet implants an evil constitution, for he
      indulges the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage605C">C</a></span>irrational nature which has no discernment of greater and
      less, but thinks the same thing at one time great and at another small—he
      is a manufacturer of images and is very far removed from the truth<a href="#Footnotebook103" id="FnAnchorbook103" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">3</span></a>.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook103"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook103" class="pginternal">3</a></span>Reading <span class="transl" title="ei)dôlopoiou=nta ... a)phestô=ta">εἰδωλοποιοῦντα … ἀφεστῶτα</span>.</p></div>
<p>
      Exactly.
    </p>
<p>
      But we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusation:—the
      power which poetry has of harming even the good (and there are very few
      who are not harmed), is surely an awful thing?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, certainly, if the effect is what you say.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">How can we be right in sympathizing with the sorrows of poetry when we would fain restrain those of real life?</span>
      Hear and judge: The best of us, as I conceive, when we listen to a passage
      of Homer, or one of the tragedians, in <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage605D">D</a></span>which he represents some pitiful
      hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration, or weeping, and
      smiting his breast—the best of us, you know, delight in giving way
      to sympathy, and are in raptures at the excellence of the poet who stirs
      our feelings most.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, of course I know.
    </p>
<p>
      But when any sorrow of our own happens to us, then you may observe that we
      pride ourselves on the opposite quality—we would fain be quiet and
      patient; this is the manly part, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage605E">E</a></span>and the other which delighted us in the
      recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true, he said. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page321"></a>321</span>
</p>
<p>
      Now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that
      which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own person?
    </p>
<p>
      No, he said, that is certainly not reasonable.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage606A">606</a></span>
      Nay, I said, quite reasonable from one point of view.
    </p>
<p>
      What point of view?
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">We fail to observe that a sentimental pity soon creates a real weakness.</span>
      If you consider, I said, that when in misfortune we feel a natural hunger
      and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation, and that this
      feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is satisfied and
      delighted by the poets;—the better nature in each of us, not having
      been sufficiently trained by reason or habit, allows the sympathetic
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage606B">B</a></span>element to break loose because the sorrow is another’s; and the spectator
      fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself in praising and pitying
      any one who comes telling him what a good man he is, and making a fuss
      about his troubles; he thinks that the pleasure is a gain, and why should
      he be supercilious and lose this and the poem too? Few persons ever
      reflect, as I should imagine, that from the evil of other men something of
      evil is communicated to themselves. And so the feeling of sorrow which has
      gathered strength at the sight of the misfortunes of others is with
      difficulty repressed in our own.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage606C">C</a></span>
      How very true!
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">In like manner the love of comedy may turn a man into a buffoon.</span>
      And does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? There are jests which
      you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic stage, or
      indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused by them, and
      are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness;—the case of pity is
      repeated;—there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to
      raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained by reason, because you
      were afraid of being thought a buffoon, is now let out again; and having
      stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre, you are betrayed
      unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home.
    </p>
<p>
      Quite true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage606D">D</a></span>
      And the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections,
      of desire and pain and pleasure, which are held to be inseparable from
      every action—in all of them <span class="pagenum"><a id="page322"></a>322</span> poetry feeds and waters the passions
      instead of drying them up; she lets them rule, although they ought to be
      controlled, if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue.
    </p>
<p>
      I cannot deny it.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage606E">E</a></span> <span class="sidenote">We are lovers of Homer, but we must expel him from our State.</span>
      Therefore, Glaucon, I said, whenever you meet with any of the eulogists of
      Homer declaring that he has been the educator of Hellas, and that he is
      profitable for education and for the ordering of human things, and that
      you should <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage607A">607</a></span>take him up again and again and get to know him and regulate
      your whole life according to him, we may love and honour those who say
      these things—they are excellent people, as far as their lights
      extend; and we are ready to acknowledge that Homer is the greatest of
      poets and first of tragedy writers; but we must remain firm in our
      conviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the only
      poetry which ought to be admitted into our State. For if you go beyond
      this and allow the honeyed muse to enter, either in epic or lyric verse,
      not law and the reason of mankind, which by common consent have ever been
      deemed best, but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in our State.
    </p>
<p>
      That is most true, he said.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage607B">B</a></span> <span class="sidenote">Apology to the poets.</span>
      And now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry, let this our
      defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in sending
      away out of our State an art having the tendencies which we have
      described; for reason constrained us. But that she may not impute to us
      any harshness or want of politeness, let us tell her that there is an
      ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry; of which there are many
      proofs, such as the saying of ‘the yelping hound howling at her lord,’ or
      of one ‘mighty in <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage607C">C</a></span>the vain talk of fools,’ and ‘the mob of sages
      circumventing Zeus,’ and the ‘subtle thinkers who are beggars after all’;
      and there are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity between them.
      Notwithstanding this, let us assure our sweet friend and the sister arts
      of imitation, that if she will only prove her title to exist in a
      well-ordered State we shall be delighted to receive her—we are very
      conscious of her charms; but we may not on that account betray the truth. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page323"></a>323</span>
      I dare say, Glaucon, that you are as much charmed by her <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage607D">D</a></span>as I am,
      especially when she appears in Homer?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, indeed, I am greatly charmed.
    </p>
<p>
      Shall I propose, then, that she be allowed to return from exile, but upon
      this condition only—that she make a defence of herself in lyrical or
      some other metre?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      And we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of
      poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf:
      let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to States and
      to human life, and we will listen in a kindly spirit; for if this can be
      proved <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage607E">E</a></span>we shall surely be the gainers—I mean, if there is a use in
      poetry as well as a delight?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said, we shall be the gainers.
    </p>
<p>
      If her defence fails, then, my dear friend, like other persons who are
      enamoured of something, but put a restraint upon themselves when they
      think their desires are opposed to their interests, so too must we after
      the manner of lovers give her up, though not without a struggle. <span class="sidenote">Poetry is attractive but not true.</span>We too
      are inspired by that love of poetry which the education <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage608A">608</a></span>of noble States
      has implanted in us, and therefore we would have her appear at her best
      and truest; but so long as she is unable to make good her defence, this
      argument of ours shall be a charm to us, which we will repeat to ourselves
      while we listen to her strains; that we may not fall away into the
      childish love of her which captivates the many. At all events we are well
      aware<a href="#Footnotebook104" id="FnAnchorbook104" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">4</span></a> that poetry being such as we have described is not to be regarded
      seriously as attaining to the truth; and he who listens to her, fearing
      for the safety of the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage608B">B</a></span>city which is within him, should be on his guard
      against her seductions and make our words his law.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook104"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook104" class="pginternal">4</a></span>Or, if we accept Madvig’s ingenious but unnecessary emendation <span class="transl" title="a)|so/metha">ᾀσόμεθα</span>,
‘At all events we will sing, that’ &amp;c.</p></div>
<p>
      Yes, he said, I quite agree with you.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, my dear Glaucon, for great is the issue at stake, greater
      than appears, whether a man is to be good or bad. And what will any one be
      profited if under the influence of honour or money or power, aye, or under
      the excitement of poetry, he neglect justice and virtue? <span class="pagenum"><a id="page324"></a>324</span>
</p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; I have been convinced by the argument, as I believe that any
      one else would have been.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage608C">C</a></span>
      And yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards which
      await virtue.
    </p>
<p>
      What, are there any greater still? If there are, they must be of an
      inconceivable greatness.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The rewards of virtue extend not only to this little space of human life but to the whole of existence.</span>
      Why, I said, what was ever great in a short time? The whole period of
      three score years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison with
      eternity?
    </p>
<p>
      Say rather ‘nothing,’ he replied.
    </p>
<p>
      And should an immortal being seriously think of this little <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage608D">D</a></span>space rather
      than of the whole?
    </p>
<p>
      Of the whole, certainly. But why do you ask?
    </p>
<p>
      Are you not aware, I said, that the soul of man is immortal and
      imperishable?
    </p>
<p>
      He looked at me in astonishment, and said: No, by heaven: And are you
      really prepared to maintain this?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, I said, I ought to be, and you too—there is no difficulty in
      proving it.
    </p>
<p>
      I see a great difficulty; but I should like to hear you state this
      argument of which you make so light.
    </p>
<p>
      Listen then.
    </p>
<p>
      I am attending.
    </p>
<p>
      There is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage608E">E</a></span>
      Would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying
      element is the evil, and the saving and improving element the good?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Everything has a good and an evil, and if not destroyed by its own evil, will not be destroyed by that of another.</span>
      And you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage609A">609</a></span>as ophthalmia
      is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body; as mildew is of
      corn, and rot of timber, or rust of copper and iron: in everything, or in
      almost everything, there is an inherent evil and disease?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      And anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil, and at
      last wholly dissolves and dies?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p>
      The vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction <span class="pagenum"><a id="page325"></a>325</span> of each;
      and if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage609B">B</a></span>for
      good certainly will not destroy them, nor again, that which is neither
      good nor evil.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      If, then, we find any nature which having this inherent corruption cannot
      be dissolved or destroyed, we may be certain that of such a nature there
      is no destruction?
    </p>
<p>
      That may be assumed.
    </p>
<p>
      Well, I said, and is there no evil which corrupts the soul?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, there are all the evils which we were just now <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage609C">C</a></span>passing in
      review: unrighteousness, intemperance, cowardice, ignorance.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Therefore, if the soul cannot be destroyed by moral evil, she certainly will not be destroyed by physical evil.</span>
      But does any of these dissolve or destroy her?—and here do not let
      us fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man, when
      he is detected, perishes through his own injustice, which is an evil of
      the soul. Take the analogy of the body: The evil of the body is a disease
      which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body; and all the things of
      which we were just now speaking come to annihilation <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage609D">D</a></span>through their own
      corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so destroying them.
      Is not this true?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      Consider the soul in like manner. Does the injustice or other evil which
      exists in the soul waste and consume her? Do they by attaching to the soul
      and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her from
      the body?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      And yet, I said, it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish
      from without through affection of external evil which could not be
      destroyed from within by a corruption of its own?
    </p>
<p>
      It is, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage609E">E</a></span>
      Consider, I said, Glaucon, that even the badness of food, whether
      staleness, decomposition, or any other bad quality, when confined to the
      actual food, is not supposed to destroy the body; although, if the badness
      of food communicates corruption to the body, then we should say that the
      body <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage610A">610</a></span>has been destroyed by a corruption of itself, which is disease,
      brought on by this; but that the body, being one thing, can be destroyed
      by the badness of food, which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page326"></a>326</span> is another, and which does not engender any
      natural infection—this we shall absolutely deny?
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Evil means the contagion of evil, and the evil of the body does not infect the soul.</span>
      And, on the same principle, unless some bodily evil can produce an evil of
      the soul, we must not suppose that the soul, which is one thing, can be
      dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said, there is reason in that.
    </p>
<p>
      Either, then, let us refute this conclusion, or, while it <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage610B">B</a></span>remains
      unrefuted, let us never say that fever, or any other disease, or the knife
      put to the throat, or even the cutting up of the whole body into the
      minutest pieces, can destroy the soul, until she herself is proved to
      become more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things being
      done to the body; but that the soul, or anything else if not destroyed <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage610C">C</a></span>by
      an internal evil, can be destroyed by an external one, is not to be
      affirmed by any man.
    </p>
<p>
      And surely, he replied, no one will ever prove that the souls of men
      become more unjust in consequence of death.
    </p>
<p>
      But if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the soul
      boldly denies this, and says that the dying do really become more evil and
      unrighteous, then, if the speaker is right, I suppose that injustice, like
      disease, must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust, and that those who
      take <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage610D">D</a></span>this disorder die by the natural inherent power of destruction which
      evil has, and which kills them sooner or later, but in quite another way
      from that in which, at present, the wicked receive death at the hands of
      others as the penalty of their deeds?
    </p>
<p>
      Nay, he said, in that case injustice, if fatal to the unjust, will not be
      so very terrible to him, for he will be delivered from evil. But I rather
      suspect the opposite to be the truth, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage610E">E</a></span>and that injustice which, if it have
      the power, will murder others, keeps the murderer alive—aye, and
      well awake too; so far removed is her dwelling-place from being a house of
      death.
    </p>
<p>
      True, I said; if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is unable
      to kill or destroy her, hardly will that which is appointed to be the
      destruction of some other body, destroy a soul or anything else except
      that of which it was appointed to be the destruction. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page327"></a>327</span>
</p>
<p>
      Yes, that can hardly be.
    </p>
<p>
      But the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil, whether <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage611A">611</a></span>inherent or
      external, must exist for ever, and if existing for ever, must be immortal?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">If the soul is indestructible, the number of souls can never increase or diminish.</span>
      That is the conclusion, I said; and, if a true conclusion, then the souls
      must always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will not diminish
      in number. Neither will they increase, for the increase of the immortal
      natures must come from something mortal, and all things would thus end in
      immortality.
    </p>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      But this we cannot believe—reason will not allow us—any <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage611B">B</a></span>more
      than we can believe the soul, in her truest nature, to be full of variety
      and difference and dissimilarity.
    </p>
<p>
      What do you mean? he said.
    </p>
<p>
      The soul, I said, being, as is now proven, immortal, must be the fairest
      of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The soul, if she is to be seen truly, should be stripped of the accidents of earth.</span>
      Her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument, and there are
      many other proofs; but to see her as she <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage611C">C</a></span>really is, not as we now behold
      her, marred by communion with the body and other miseries, you must
      contemplate her with the eye of reason, in her original purity; and then
      her beauty will be revealed, and justice and injustice and all the things
      which we have described will be manifested more clearly. Thus far, we have
      spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at present, but we must
      remember also that we have seen her only in a condition which may be
      compared to <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage611D">D</a></span>that of the sea-god Glaucus, whose original image can hardly
      be discerned because his natural members are broken off and crushed and
      damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways, and incrustations have grown
      over them of seaweed and shells and stones, so that he is more like some
      monster than he is to his own natural form. And the soul which we behold
      is in a similar condition, disfigured by ten thousand ills. But not there,
      Glaucon, not there must we look.
    </p>
<p>
      Where then?
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage611E">E</a></span> <span class="sidenote">Her true conversation is with the eternal.</span>
      At her love of wisdom. Let us see whom she affects, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page328"></a>328</span> what society and
      converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal and
      eternal and divine; also how different she would become if wholly
      following this superior principle, and borne by a divine impulse out of
      the ocean in which she now is, and disengaged from the stones and shells
      and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage612A">612</a></span>around her
      because she feeds upon earth, and is overgrown by the good things of this
      life as they are termed: then you would see her as she is, and know
      whether she have one shape only or many, or what her nature is. Of her
      affections and of the forms which she takes in this present life I think
      that we have now said enough.
    </p>
<p>
      True, he replied.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Having put aside for argument’s sake the rewards of virtue, we may now claim to have them restored.</span>
      And thus, I said, we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument<a href="#Footnotebook105" id="FnAnchorbook105" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">5</span></a>; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage612B">B</a></span>we
      have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice, which, as you were
      saying, are to be found in Homer and Hesiod; but justice in her own nature
      has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature. Let a man do
      what is just, whether he have the ring of Gyges or not, and even if in
      addition to the ring of Gyges he put on the helmet of Hades.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook105"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook105" class="pginternal">5</a></span>Reading <span class="transl" title="a)pelusa/metha">ἀπελυσάμεθα</span>.</p></div>
<p>
      Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      And now, Glaucon, there will be no harm in further enumerating how many
      and how great are the rewards which <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage612C">C</a></span>justice and the other virtues procure
      to the soul from gods and men, both in life and after death.
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly not, he said.
    </p>
<p>
      Will you repay me, then, what you borrowed in the argument?
    </p>
<p>
      What did I borrow?
    </p>
<p>
      The assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust just:
      for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case could not
      possibly escape the eyes of gods and men, still this admission ought to be
      made for the sake of the argument, in order that pure justice might be
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage612D">D</a></span>weighed against pure injustice. Do you remember?
    </p>
<p>
      I should be much to blame if I had forgotten.
    </p>
<p>
      Then, as the cause is decided, I demand on behalf of justice that the
      estimation in which she is held by gods and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page329"></a>329</span> men and which we acknowledge
      to be her due should now be restored to her by us<a href="#Footnotebook106" id="FnAnchorbook106" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">6</span></a>; since she has been
      shown to confer reality, and not to deceive those who truly possess her,
      let what has been taken from her be given back, that so she may win that
      palm of appearance which is hers also, and which she gives to her own.
    </p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a id="Footnotebook106"></a><a href="#FnAnchorbook106" class="pginternal">6</a></span>Reading <span class="transl" title="ê(mô=n">ἡμῶν</span>.</p></div>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage612E">E</a></span>
      The demand, he said, is just.
    </p>
<p>
      In the first place, I said—and this is the first thing which you
      will have to give back—the nature both of the just and unjust is
      truly known to the gods.
    </p>
<p>
      Granted.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The just man is the friend of the gods, and all things work together for his good.</span>
      And if they are both known to them, one must be the friend and the other
      the enemy of the gods, as we admitted from the beginning?
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage613A">613</a></span>
      And the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all things
      at their best, excepting only such evil as is the necessary consequence of
      former sins?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Then this must be our notion of the just man, that even when he is in
      poverty or sickness, or any other seeming misfortune, all things will in
      the end work together for good to him in life and death: for the gods have
      a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like God, as
      far as <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage613B">B</a></span>man can attain the divine likeness, by the pursuit of virtue?
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; if he is like God he will surely not be neglected by him.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">The unjust is the opposite.</span>
      And of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      Such, then, are the palms of victory which the gods give the just?
    </p>
<p>
      That is my conviction.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">He may be compared to a runner who is only good at the start.</span>
      And what do they receive of men? Look at things as they really are, and
      you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners, who run
      well from the starting-place to the goal but not back again from the goal:
      they go off at a great pace, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage613C">C</a></span>but in the end only look foolish, slinking
      away with their ears draggling on their shoulders, and without a crown;
      but the true runner comes to the finish and receives the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page330"></a>330</span> prize and is
      crowned. And this is the way with the just; he who endures to the end of
      every action and occasion of his entire life has a good report and carries
      off the prize which men have to bestow.
    </p>
<p>
      True.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">Recapitulation of things unfit for ears polite which had been described by Glaucon in Book II.</span>
      And now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which you
      were attributing to the fortunate unjust. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage613D">D</a></span>I shall say of them, what you
      were saying of the others, that as they grow older, they become rulers in
      their own city if they care to be; they marry whom they like and give in
      marriage to whom they will; all that you said of the others I now say of
      these. And, on the other hand, of the unjust I say that the greater
      number, even though they escape in their youth, are found out at last and
      look foolish at the end of their course, and when they come to be old and
      miserable are flouted alike by stranger and citizen; they are beaten and
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage613E">E</a></span>then come those things unfit for ears polite, as you truly term them; they
      will be racked and have their eyes burned out, as you were saying. And you
      may suppose that I have repeated the remainder of your tale of horrors.
      But will you let me assume, without reciting them, that these things are
      true?
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly, he said, what you say is true.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage614A">614</a></span>
      These, then, are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed upon
      the just by gods and men in this present life, in addition to the other
      good things which justice of herself provides.
    </p>
<p>
      Yes, he said; and they are fair and lasting.
    </p>
<p>
      And yet, I said, all these are as nothing either in number or greatness in
      comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and unjust
      after death. And you ought to hear them, and then both just and unjust
      will have received from us a full payment of the debt which the argument
      owes to them.
    </p>
<p><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage614B">B</a></span>
      Speak, he said; there are few things which I would more gladly hear.
    </p>
<p><span class="sidenote">S<span class="smcap">OCRATES</span>.</span><span class="sidenote">The vision of Er.</span>
      Well, I said, I will tell you a tale; not one of the tales which Odysseus
      tells to the hero Alcinous, yet this too is a tale of a hero, Er the son
      of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth. He was slain in battle, and ten days
      afterwards, when the bodies of the dead were taken up already in a state
      of corruption, his body was found unaffected by decay, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page331"></a>331</span> carried away
      home to be buried. And on the twelfth day, as he was lying on the funeral
      pile, he returned to life and told them what he had seen in the other
      world. <span class="sidenote">The judgement.</span>He said that when his soul left the body he went on a journey with
      a great company, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage614C">C</a></span>and that they came to a mysterious place at which there
      were two openings in the earth; they were near together, and over against
      them were two other openings in the heaven above. <span class="sidenote">The two openings
in heaven and the two in earth through which passed those who were
beginning and those who had completed their pilgrimage.</span>In the intermediate
      space there were judges seated, who commanded the just, after they had
      given judgment on them and had bound their sentences in front of them, to
      ascend by the heavenly way on the right hand; and in like manner the
      unjust were bidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left hand;
      these also bore the symbols of their deeds, but fastened on their backs.
      He drew near, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage614D">D</a></span>and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would
      carry the report of the other world to men, and they bade him hear and see
      all that was to be heard and seen in that place. Then he beheld and saw on
      one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and earth when
      sentence had been given on them; and at the two other openings other
      souls, some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn with travel, some
      descending out of heaven clean and bright. And <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage614E">E</a></span>arriving ever and anon they
      seemed to have come from a long journey, and they went forth with gladness
      into the meadow, where they encamped as at a festival; and those who knew
      one another embraced and conversed, the souls which came from earth
      curiously enquiring about the things above, <span class="sidenote">The meeting in the meadow.</span>and the souls which came from
      heaven about the things beneath. And they told one another of what had
      happened by the way, those from below weeping and sorrowing <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage615A">615</a></span>at the
      remembrance of the things which they had endured and seen in their journey
      beneath the earth (now the journey lasted a thousand years), while those
      from above were describing heavenly delights and visions of inconceivable
      beauty. The story, Glaucon, would take too long to tell; but the sum was
      this:—<span class="sidenote">The punishment tenfold the sin.</span>He said that for every wrong which they had done to any one
      they suffered tenfold; or once in a hundred years—such being
      reckoned to be the length <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage615B">B</a></span>of man’s life, and the penalty being thus paid
      ten times in a thousand years. If, for example, there were any who had
      been <span class="pagenum"><a id="page332"></a>332</span> the cause of many deaths, or had betrayed or enslaved cities or
      armies, or been guilty of any other evil behaviour, for each and all of
      their offences they received punishment ten times over, and the rewards of
      beneficence and justice and <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage615C">C</a></span>holiness were in the same proportion. <span class="sidenote">‘Unbaptized infants.’</span>/I need
      hardly repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon
      as they were born. Of piety and impiety to gods and parents, and of
      murderers<a href="#Footnotebook107" id="FnAnchorbook107" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">7</span></a>, there were retributions other and greater far which he
      described. He mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits asked
      another, ‘Where is Ardiaeus the Great?’ <span class="sidenote">Ardiaeus the tyrant.</span>(Now this Ardiaeus lived a
      thousand years before the time of Er: he had been the tyrant of some city
      of Pamphylia, and had murdered his aged father and his elder brother, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage615D">D</a></span>and
      was said to have committed many other abominable crimes.) The answer of
      the other spirit was: ‘He comes not hither and will never come. And this,’
      said he, ‘was one of the dreadful sights which we ourselves witnessed. We
      were at the mouth of the cavern, and, having completed all our
      experiences, were about to reascend, when of a sudden Ardiaeus appeared
      and several others, most of whom were tyrants; and there were also besides
      the tyrants private individuals <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage615E">E</a></span>who had been great criminals: they were
      just, as they fancied, about to return into the upper world, but the
      mouth, instead of admitting them, gave a roar, whenever any of these
      <span class="sidenote">Incurable sinners.</span>incurable sinners or some one who had not been sufficiently punished tried
      to ascend; and then wild men of fiery aspect, who were standing by and
      heard the sound, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage616A">616</a></span>seized and carried them off; and Ardiaeus and others they
      bound head and foot and hand, and threw them down and flayed them with
      scourges, and dragged them along the road at the side, carding them on
      thorns like wool, and declaring to the passers-by what were their crimes,
      and that<a href="#Footnotebook108" id="FnAnchorbook108" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">8</span></a> they were being taken away to be cast into hell.’ And of all the
      many terrors which they had endured, he said that there was none like the
      terror which each of them felt at that moment, lest they should hear the
      voice; and when there was silence, one by one they ascended with exceeding
      joy. These, said Er, were the penalties and retributions, and there were
      blessings as great. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page333"></a>333</span>

      Now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days, on
      the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey, and, on the
      fourth day after, he said that they came to a place where they could see
      from above a line of light, straight as a column, extending right through
      the whole heaven and through the earth, in colour resembling the rainbow,
      only brighter and purer; another day’s journey brought them to the place,
      and there, in the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage616C">C</a></span>midst of the light, they saw the ends of the chains of
      heaven let down from above: for this light is the belt of heaven, and
      holds together the circle of the universe, like the under-girders of a
      trireme. From these ends is extended the spindle of Necessity, on which
      all the revolutions turn. The shaft and hook of this spindle are made of
      steel, and the whorl is made partly of steel and also partly of other
      materials. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage616D">D</a></span><span class="sidenote">The whorls representing the spheres of the heavenly bodies.</span>Now the whorl is in form like the whorl used on earth; and the
      description of it implied that there is one large hollow whorl which is
      quite scooped out, and into this is fitted another lesser one, and
      another, and another, and four others, making eight in all, like vessels
      which fit into one another; the whorls show their edges on the upper side,
      and on their <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage616E">E</a></span>lower side all together form one continuous whorl. This is
      pierced by the spindle, which is driven home through the centre of the
      eighth. The first and outermost whorl has the rim broadest, and the seven
      inner whorls are narrower, in the following proportions—the sixth is
      next to the first in size, the fourth next to the sixth; then comes the
      eighth; the seventh is fifth, the fifth is sixth, the third is seventh,
      last and eighth comes the second. The largest [or fixed stars] is
      spangled, and the seventh [or sun] is brightest; the eighth [or moon]
      <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage617A">617</a></span>coloured by the reflected light of the seventh; the second and fifth
      [Saturn and Mercury] are in colour like one another, and yellower than the
      preceding; the third [Venus] has the whitest light; the fourth [Mars] is
      reddish; the sixth [Jupiter] is in whiteness second. Now the whole spindle
      has the same motion; but, as the whole revolves in one direction, the
      seven inner circles move slowly in the other, and of these the swiftest is
      the eighth; next in swiftness are the <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage617B">B</a></span>seventh, sixth, and fifth, which
      move together; third in swiftness appeared to move according to the law of
      this <span class="pagenum"><a id="page334"></a>334</span> reversed motion the fourth; the third appeared fourth and the second
      fifth. The spindle turns on the knees of Necessity; and on the upper
      surface of each circle is a siren, who goes round with them, hymning a
      single tone or note. The eight together form one harmony; and round about,
      at equal intervals, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage617C">C</a></span>there is another band, three in number, each sitting
      upon her throne: these are the Fates, daughters of Necessity, who are
      clothed in white robes and have chaplets upon their heads, Lachesis and
      Clotho and Atropos, who accompany with their voices the harmony of the
      sirens—Lachesis singing of the past, Clotho of the present, Atropos
      of the future; Clotho from time to time assisting with a touch of her
      right hand the revolution of the outer circle of the whorl or spindle, and
      Atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner ones, and
      Lachesis laying <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage617D">D</a></span>hold of either in turn, first with one hand and then with
      the other.
    </p>
<p>
      When Er and the spirits arrived, their duty was to go at once to Lachesis;
      but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in order; then he
      took from the knees of Lachesis lots and samples of lives, and having
      mounted a high pulpit, spoke as follows: <span class="sidenote">The proclamation of the free choice.</span>‘Hear the word of Lachesis, the
      daughter of Necessity. Mortal souls, behold a new cycle of life and
      mortality. Your genius will not be allotted to you, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage617E">E</a></span>but you will choose
      your genius; and let him who draws the first lot have the first choice,
      and the life which he chooses shall be his destiny. Virtue is free, and as
      a man honours or dishonours her he will have more or less of her; the
      responsibility is with the chooser—God is justified.’ When the
      Interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots indifferently among them
      all, and each of them took up the lot which fell near him, all but Er
      himself (he was not allowed), and each as he took his lot perceived the
      number which he had obtained. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage618A">618</a></span>Then the Interpreter placed on the ground
      before them the samples of lives; and there were many more lives than the
      souls present, and they were of all sorts. There were lives of every
      animal and of man in every condition. And there were tyrannies among them,
      some lasting out the tyrant’s life, others which broke off in the middle
      and came to an end in poverty and exile and beggary; and there were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page335"></a>335</span> lives
      of famous men, some who were famous for their form and beauty as well as
      for their strength and success in games, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage618B">B</a></span>or, again, for their birth and
      the qualities of their ancestors; and some who were the reverse of famous
      for the opposite qualities. And of women likewise; there was not, however,
      any definite character in them, because the soul, when choosing a new
      life, must of necessity become different. But there was every other
      quality, and the all mingled with one another, and also with elements of
      wealth and poverty, and disease and health; and there were mean states
      also. And here, my dear Glaucon, is the supreme peril of our human state;
      and therefore the utmost care should be taken. <span class="sidenote">The complexity of circumstances,</span><span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage618C">C</a></span>Let each one of us leave
      every other kind of knowledge and seek and follow one thing only, if
      peradventure he may be able to learn and may find some one who will make
      him able to learn and discern between good and evil, and so to choose
      always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity. He should
      consider the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned
      severally and collectively upon virtue; <span class="sidenote">and their relation to the human soul.</span>he should know what the effect of
      beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage618D">D</a></span>particular soul, and
      what are the good and evil consequences of noble and humble birth, of
      private and public station, of strength and weakness, of cleverness and
      dullness, and of all the natural and acquired gifts of the soul, and the
      operation of them when conjoined; he will then look at the nature of the
      soul, and from the consideration of all these qualities he will be able to
      determine which is the better and which is the worse; and so he will
      choose, giving the name <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage618E">E</a></span>of evil to the life which will make his soul more
      unjust, and good to the life which will make his soul more just; all else
      he will disregard. For we have seen and know that this is <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage619A">619</a></span>the best choice
      both in life and after death. A man must take with him into the world
      below an adamantine faith in truth and right, that there too he may be
      undazzled by the desire of wealth or the other allurements of evil, lest,
      coming upon tyrannies and similar villainies, he do irremediable wrongs to
      others and suffer yet worse himself; but let him know how to choose the
      mean and avoid the extremes on either side, as far as possible, not only
      in this life but <span class="pagenum"><a id="page336"></a>336</span> in all <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage619B">B</a></span>that which is to come. For this is the way of
      happiness.
    </p>
<p>
      And according to the report of the messenger from the other world this was
      what the prophet said at the time: ‘Even for the last comer, if he chooses
      wisely and will live diligently, there is appointed a happy and not
      undesirable existence. Let not him who chooses first be careless, and let
      not the last despair.’ And when he had spoken, he who had the first choice
      came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny; his mind having
      been darkened by folly and sensuality, he had not thought out the whole
      matter before he chose, and did not at first sight perceive that he <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage619C">C</a></span>was
      fated, among other evils, to devour his own children. But when he had time
      to reflect, and saw what was in the lot, he began to beat his breast and
      lament over his choice, forgetting the proclamation of the prophet; for,
      instead of throwing the blame of his misfortune on himself, he accused
      chance and the gods, and everything rather than himself. <span class="sidenote">Habit not enough without philosophy when circumstances change.</span>Now he was one of
      those who came from heaven, and in a former life had dwelt in a
      well-ordered State, but his virtue <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage619D">D</a></span>was a matter of habit only, and he had
      no philosophy. And it was true of others who were similarly overtaken,
      that the greater number of them came from heaven and therefore they had
      never been schooled by trial, whereas the pilgrims who came from earth
      having themselves suffered and seen others suffer, were not in a hurry to
      choose. And owing to this inexperience of theirs, and also because the lot
      was a chance, many of the souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an
      evil for a good. For if a man had always on his arrival in this world
      dedicated himself from the first to sound philosophy, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage619E">E</a></span>and had been
      moderately fortunate in the number of the lot, he might, as the messenger
      reported, be happy here, and also his journey to another life and return
      to this, instead of being rough and underground, would be smooth and
      heavenly. <span class="sidenote">The spectacle of the election.</span>Most curious, he said, was the spectacle—sad and laughable
      and strange; for the choice of the souls <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage620A">620</a></span>was in most cases based on their
      experience of a previous life. There he saw the soul which had once been
      Orpheus choosing the life of a swan out of enmity to the race of women,
      hating to be born of a woman because they had <span class="pagenum"><a id="page337"></a>337</span> been his murderers; he
      beheld also the soul of Thamyras choosing the life of a nightingale;
      birds, on the other hand, like the swan and other musicians, wanting to be
      men. The <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage620B">B</a></span>soul which obtained the twentieth<a href="#Footnotebook109" id="FnAnchorbook109" class="pginternal"><span class="sp">9</span></a> lot chose the life of a lion,
      and this was the soul of Ajax the son of Telamon, who would not be a man,
      remembering the injustice which was done him in the judgment about the
      arms. The next was Agamemnon, who took the life of an eagle, because, like
      Ajax, he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings. About the middle
      came the lot of Atalanta; she, seeing the great fame of an athlete, was
      unable to resist the temptation: and after her <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage620C">C</a></span>there followed the soul of
      Epeus the son of Panopeus passing into the nature of a woman cunning in
      the arts; and far away among the last who chose, the soul of the jester
      Thersites was putting on the form of a monkey. There came also the soul of
      Odysseus having yet to make a choice, and his lot happened to be the last
      of them all. Now the recollection of former toils had disenchanted him of
      ambition, and he went about for a considerable time in search of the life
      of a private man who had no cares; he had some difficulty in finding this,
      which was lying about and had been neglected by everybody else; <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage620D">D</a></span>and when
      he saw it, he said that he would have done the same had his lot been first
      instead of last, and that he was delighted to have it. And not only did
      men pass into animals, but I must also mention that there were animals
      tame and wild who changed into one another and into corresponding human
      natures—the good into the gentle and the evil into the savage, in
      all sorts of combinations.

<p>
      All the souls had now chosen their lives, and they went in the order of
      their choice to Lachesis, who sent with them the genius whom they had
      severally chosen, to be the guardian <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage620E">E</a></span>of their lives and the fulfiller of
      the choice: this genius led the souls first to Clotho, and drew them
      within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand, thus ratifying
      the destiny of each; and then, when they were fastened to this, carried
      them to Atropos, who spun the threads and made <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage621A">621</a></span>them irreversible, whence
      without turning round they passed beneath the throne of Necessity; and
      when they had all passed, they marched on in a scorching heat to the plain
      of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page338"></a>338</span> Forgetfulness, which was a barren waste destitute of trees and verdure;
      and then towards evening they encamped by the river of Unmindfulness,
      whose water no vessel can hold; of this they were all obliged to drink a
      certain quantity, and those who were not saved by wisdom drank more than
      was necessary; and each one as he drank forgot all things. <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage621B">B</a></span>Now after they
      had gone to rest, about the middle of the night there was a thunderstorm
      and earthquake, and then in an instant they were driven upwards in all
      manner of ways to their birth, like stars shooting. He himself was
      hindered from drinking the water. But in what manner or by what means he
      returned to the body he could not say; only, in the morning, awaking
      suddenly, he found himself lying on the pyre.
    </p>
<p>
      And thus, Glaucon, the tale has been saved and has not perished, <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage621C">C</a></span>and will
      save us if we are obedient to the word spoken; and we shall pass safely
      over the river of Forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled.
      Wherefore my counsel is, that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way and
      follow after justice and virtue always, considering that the soul is
      immortal and able to endure every sort of good and every sort of evil.
      Thus shall we live dear to one another and to the gods, both while
      remaining here and when, like <span class="stpagenum"><a id="stpage621D">D</a></span>conquerors in the games who go round to
      gather gifts, we receive our reward. And it shall be well with us both in
      this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand years which we have been
      describing.

Art. [<i>Art, according to the conception of Plato, is not a collection

things animate as well as inanimate</i> (3. <a href="#stpage400A" class="pginternal">400</a>, <a href="#stpage401A" class="pginternal">401</a>). <i>He knows nothing
of ‘schools’ or of the history of art, nor does he select any
building or statue for condemnation or admiration.</i> [<i>Cp.</i> Protag. 311
C, <i>where Pheidias is casually mentioned as the typical sculptor, and</i>
Meno 91 D, <i>where Socrates says that Pheidias, ‘although he wrought
such exceedingly noble works,’ did not make nearly so much money by
them as Protagoras did by his wisdom.</i>] <i>Plato judges art by one test,
‘simplicity,’ but under this he includes moderation, purity, and
harmony of proportion; and he would extend to sculpture and
architecture the same rigid censorship which he has already applied to poetry and music</i> (3. <a href="#stpage401A" class="pginternal">401 A</a>). <i>He
dislikes the ‘illusions’ of painting</i> (10. <a href="#stpage602A" class="pginternal">602</a>) <i>and the ‘false
proportions’ given by sculptors to their subjects</i> (Soph. 234 E),
<i>both of which he classes as a species of magic. With more justice he
points out the danger of an excessive devotion to art;</i> (cp. <i>the
ludicrous pictures of the unmanly musician</i> (3. <a href="#stpage411A" class="pginternal">411</a>), <i>and of the

Community. [<i>The communism of the Republic seems to have been suggested
by Plato’s desire for the unity of the state</i> (cp. 5. <a href="#stpage462A" class="pginternal">462</a> foll.). <i>If
those ‘two small pestilent words, “meum” and “tuum,” which have
engendered so much strife among men and created so much mischief in
the world,’ could be banished from the lips and thoughts of mankind,
the ideal state would soon be realized. The citizens would have
parents, wives, children, and property in common; they would rejoice
in each other’s prosperity, and sorrow at each other’s misfortune; they
would call their rulers not ‘lords’ and ‘masters,’ but ‘friends’
and ‘saviours.’ Plato is aware that such a conception could hardly be
carried out in this world; and he evades or adjourns, rather than
solves, the difficulty by the famous assertion that only when the
philosopher rules in the city will the ills of human life find an end</i>
[<i>cp.</i> Introduction, <a href="#pageclxxiii" class="pginternal">p. clxxiii</a>]. <i>In the Critias, where the ideal state,
as Plato himself hints to us</i> (110 D), <i>is to some extent reproduced in an
imaginary description of ancient Attica, property is common, but
there is no mention of a community of wives and children. Finally in
the Laws</i> (5. 739), <i>Plato while still maintaining the blessings of communism,
recognizes the impossibility of its realization, and sets
about the construction of a ‘second-best state’ in which the rights
of property are conceded; although, according to Aristotle</i> (Pol. ii.
6, § 4), <i>he gradually reverts to the ideal polity in all except a few
unimportant particulars.</i>]

Education. [<i>Education in the Republic is divided into two parts,</i> (i)
<i>the common education of the citizens;</i> (ii) <i>the special education of
the rulers.</i> (i) <i>The first, beginning with childhood in the plays of
the children</i> [<i>cp.</i> Laws 1. 643 B], <i>is the old Hellenic education,</i>
[<i>the</i> <span class="transl" title="katabeblême/na paideu/mata">καταβεβλημένα παιδεύματα</span> <i>of Aristotle</i>, Pol. viii. 2, § 6],
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page348"></a>348</span>—<i>‘music for the mind and gymnastic for the body’</i> [<i>cp.</i> Laws 7. 795
E]. <i>But Plato soon discovers that both are really intended for the
benefit of the soul</i> [<i>cp.</i> Laws 5. 743 D]; <i>and under ‘music’ he includes
literature</i> (<span class="transl" title="lo/goi">λόγοι</span>), <i>i.e. humane culture as distinguished from
scientific knowledge. Music precedes gymnastic; both are not to be
learned together; only the simpler kinds of either are tolerated</i>
[<i>cp.</i> Laws Book VII, <i>passim</i>]. <i>Boys and girls share equally in both</i>
[<i>cp.</i> Laws 7. 794 D]. <i>The greatest attention must be paid to good
surroundings; nothing mean or vile must meet the eye or strike the
ear of the young scholar. The fairy tales of childhood and the
fictions of the poets are alike placed under censorship</i> [<i>cp.</i> Laws Book
X, <i>and see s. v.</i> <a href="#Poetry" class="pginternal">Poetry</a>]. <i>Gentleness is to be united with manliness;
beauty of form and activity of mind are to mingle in perfect and
harmonious accord.</i><br>—(ii) <i>The special education commences at twenty by
the selection of the most promising students. These spend ten years in
the acquisition of the higher branches of arithmetic, geometry,
astronomy, harmony</i> [<i>cp.</i> Laws 7. 817 E], <i>which are not to be pursued
in a scientific spirit or for utility only, but rather with a view to
their combination by means of dialectic into an ideal of all
knowledge</i> (<i>see s. v.</i> <a href="#Dialectic" class="pginternal">Dialectic</a>). <i>At thirty a further selection is
made: those selected spend five years in the study of philosophy, are
then sent into active life for fifteen years, and finally after fifty
return to philosophy, which for the remainder of their days is to
form their chief occupation</i> (<i>see s. v.</i> <a href="#Ruler" class="pginternal">Rulers</a>).]

and ‘God is true and</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page351"></a>351</span> <i>the author of truth.’ These canons are also the test by which he tries
poetry and the poets</i> (<i>see s. v.</i> <a href="#Poetry" class="pginternal">Poetry</a>):—<i>Homer and the tragedians
represent the Gods as changing their forms or as deceiving men by
lying dreams, and therefore they must be expelled from the state. But
Plato has not yet acquired the austere temper of his later years. He
does not threaten the impenitent unbeliever with bonds and death</i> (Laws
10. 908, 910), <i>but is content to show by argument the superiority of
justice over injustice. In other respects the theology of the Republic
is repeated and amplified in the Laws; the theses that God is
not the author of evil and will not accept the gifts of the wicked or
favour the unjust, are maintained with equal earnestness in both.
The Republic is less pessimistic in tone than the Laws; but the
thought of the insignificance of man and the briefness of human

Government, forms of. [<i>The classification of forms of government
which Plato adopts in the Republic is not exactly the same with that
given in the Statesman or the Laws. Both in the Republic</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page352"></a>352</span> <i>and the Statesman
the series commences with the perfect state,
which may be either monarchy or aristocracy, accordingly as the ‘one
best man’ bears rule or many who are all ‘perfect in virtue’</i> [<i>cp.</i>
Arist. Pol. iv. 2, § 1]. <i>But in the Republic the further succession is
somewhat fancifully connected with the divisions of the soul. The rule
of reason</i> [<i>i.e. the perfect state</i>] <i>passes into timocracy, in which
the ‘spirited element’ is predominant</i> (8. <a href="#stpage548A" class="pginternal">548</a>), <i>timocracy into three
governments in turn, which represent the ‘appetitive principle,’—first,
oligarchy, in which the desire of wealth is supreme</i> (8. <a href="#stpage533D" class="pginternal">533 D</a>; 9. <a href="#stpage581A" class="pginternal">581</a>); <i>secondly, democracy, characterised by an unbounded lust
for freedom</i> (9. <a href="#stpage561A" class="pginternal">561</a>); <i>thirdly, tyranny, in which all evil desires grow
unchecked, and the tyrant becomes ‘the waking reality of what he
once was in his dreams only’</i> (9. <a href="#stpage574E" class="pginternal">574 E</a>). <i>Each of these inferior forms
is illustrated in the individual who corresponds to the state and
‘is set over against it’</i> (8. <a href="#stpage550C" class="pginternal">550 C</a>). <i>In the Statesman, after the
government of the one or many good has been separated, the remaining
forms are classified accordingly as the government has or has not
regard to law, and democracy is said to be</i> (303 A) <i>‘the worst of
lawful and the best of lawless governments’</i> (<i>an expression criticised
by Aristotle,</i> Pol. iv. 2, § 3). <i>In the Laws again the subject is
differently treated: monarchy and democracy are described as ‘the two
mother forms,’ which must be combined in order to produce a good state</i>
(3. 693), <i>and the Spartan and Cretan constitutions are therefore
praised as polities in which every form of government is represented</i>
(4. 712). <i>But the majority of existing states are mere class
governments and have no regard to virtue</i> (12. 962 E). <i>These various
ideas are nearly all reproduced or criticised in the Politics of
Aristotle, who, however, does not employ the term ‘timocracy,’
and adds one great original conception,—the</i> <span class="transl" title="mesê\ politei/a">μεσὴ πολιτεία</span>, <i>or

Idea. [<i>The Idea of Good is an abstraction, which, under that name at
least, does not elsewhere occur in Plato’s writings. But it is
probably not essentially different from another abstraction, ‘the
true being of things,’ which is mentioned in many of his Dialogues</i>
[<i>cp. passages cited s. v. <a href="#Being" class="pginternal">Being</a></i>]. <i>He has nowhere given an
explanation of his meaning, not because he was ‘regardless whether we
understood him or not,’ but rather, perhaps, because he was himself
unable to state in precise terms the ideal which floated before his
mind. He belonged to an age in which men felt too strongly the first
pleasure of metaphysical speculation to be able to estimate the true
value of the ideas which they conceived</i> (<i>cp. his own picture of the
effect of dialectic on the youthful mind,</i> 7. <a href="#stpage539A" class="pginternal">539</a>). <i>To him, as to the
Schoolmen of the Middle Ages, an abstraction seemed truer than a fact: he
was impatient to shake off the shackles of sense and rise into the
purer atmosphere of ideas. Yet in the allegory of the cave</i> (<i><a href="#BookVII" class="pginternal">Book VII</a></i>),
<i>whose inhabitants must go up to the light of perfect knowledge but
descend again into the obscurity of opinion, he has shown that he was
not unaware of the necessity of finding a firm starting-point for
these flights of metaphysical imagination</i> (<i>cp.</i> 6. <a href="#stpage510A" class="pginternal">510</a>). <i>A passage in
the Philebus</i> (65 A) <i>gives perhaps the best insight into his meaning:
‘If we are not able to hunt the good with one idea only, with three
we may take our prey,—Beauty, Symmetry, Truth.’ The three were
inseparable to the Greek mind, and no conception of perfection could
be formed in which they did not unite.</i> (Cp. Introduction, <a href="#pagelxix" class="pginternal">pp. lxix</a>,

Justice. [<i>The search for justice is the groundwork or foundation of
the Republic, which commences with an enquiry into its nature and ends
with a triumphant demonstration of the superior happiness enjoyed
by the just man. In the First Book several definitions
of justice are attempted, all of which prove inadequate. Glaucon and
Adeimantus then intervene:—mankind regard justice as a necessity, not
as a good in itself, or at best as only to be practised because of the
temporal benefits which flow from it: can Socrates prove that it
belongs to a higher class of goods? Socrates in reply proposes to
construct an ideal state in which justice will be more easily
recognised than in the individual. Justice is thus discovered to
be the essential virtue of the state,</i> (<i>a thesis afterwards enlarged
upon by Aristotle</i> [Pol. i. 2, § 16; iii. 13, § 3]), <i>the bond of the social
organization, and, like temperance in the Laws</i> [3. 696, 697; 4. 709
E], <i>rather the accompaniment or condition of the virtues than a virtue
in itself</i> [<i>cp.</i> Introduction, <a href="#pagelxiii" class="pginternal">p. lxiii</a>]. <i>Expressed in an outward or
political form it becomes the great principle which has been already
enunciated</i> (i. 322), <i>‘that every man shall do his own work;’ on this
Plato bases the necessity of the division into classes which underlies
the whole fabric of the ideal state</i> (4. <a href="#stpage433A" class="pginternal">433</a> foll.; Tim. 17 C). <i>Thus we
are led to acknowledge the happiness of the just; for he alone reflects in
 himself this vital principle of the state</i> (4. <a href="#stpage445A" class="pginternal">445</a>). <i>The
final proof is supplied by a comparison of the perfect state with
actual forms of government. These, like the individuals who correspond
to them, become more and more miserable as they recede further from
the ideal, and the climax is reached</i> (9. <a href="#stpage587A" class="pginternal">587</a>) <i>when the tyrant is
shown by the aid of arithmetic to have ‘729 times less pleasure than
the king’</i> [<i>i.e. the perfectly just ruler</i>]. <i>Lastly, the happiness of
the just is proved to</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page359"></a>359</span> <i>extend also into the next world, where men
 appear before the judgment
seat of heaven and receive the due reward of their deeds in this
life.</i>]

Music. [<i>Music to the ancients had a far wider significance than to us.
It was opposed to gymnastic as ‘mental’ to ‘bodily’ training, and
included equally reading and writing, mathematics, harmony, poetry,
and music strictly speaking:  drawing, as Aristotle tells us</i> (Pol.
viii. 3, § 1), <i>was sometimes made a separate division.</i><br>I. <i>Music</i> (<i>in
this wider sense</i>), <i>Plato says, should precede gymnastic; and,
according to a remarkable passage in the Protagoras</i> (325 C), <i>the
pupils in a Greek school were actually instructed in reading and
writing, made to learn poetry by heart, and taught to play on the
lyre, before they went to the gymnasium. The ages at which children
should commence these various studies are not stated in the Republic;
but in the VIIth Book of the Laws, where the subject is treated more
in detail, the children begin going to school at ten, and spend three
years in learning to read and write, and another three years in music</i>
(Laws 7. 810). <i>This agrees very fairly with the selection of the</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page363"></a>363</span>
<i>most promising youth at the age of twenty</i> (Rep. 7. <a href="#stpage537A" class="pginternal">537</a>), <i>as it would
allow a corresponding period of three years for gymnastic training.</i>
<br>II. <i>Music, strictly so called, plays a great part in Plato’s scheme
of education. He hopes by its aid to make the lives of his youthful
scholars harmonious and gracious, and to implant in their souls true
conceptions of good and evil. Music is a gift of the Gods to men,
and was never intended, ‘as the many foolishly and blasphemously suppose,’
 merely to give us an idle pleasure</i> (Tim. 47 E; Laws 2. 654, 658
E; 7. 802 D). <i>Neither should a freeman aim at attaining perfect
execution</i> [<i>cp.</i> Arist. Pol. viii. 6, §§ 7, 15]:  <i>in the Laws</i> (7. 810) <i>we
are told that every one must go through the three years course of
music, ‘neither more nor less, whether he like or whether he dislike
the study.’ Both instruments and music are to be of a simple
character: in the Republic only the lyre, the pipe, and the flute
are tolerated, and the Dorian and Phrygian harmonies. No change in the
fashions of music is permitted; for where there is licence in music
there will be anarchy in the state. In this desire for simplicity and
fixity in music Plato was probably opposed to the tendencies of his
own age. The severe harmony which had once characterized Hellenic art
was passing out of favour: alike in architecture, sculpture, painting,
 literature, and music, richer and more ornate styles prevailed.
We regard the change as inevitable, and not perhaps wholly to be
regretted: to Plato it was a cause rather than a sign of the decline
of Hellas.</i>]

Poetry. [<i>The Republic is the first of Plato’s works in which he
seriously examines the value of poetry in education, and the place of
the poets in the state. The question could hardly be neglected by the
philosopher who proposed to construct an ideal polity or government of
the best. For poetry played a great part in Hellenic life: the
children learned whole poems by heart in their schools</i> (Protag. 326 A;
Laws 7. 810 C); <i>the rhapsode delighted the crowds at the festivals</i> (Ion
535); <i>the theatres were free, or almost free, to all, ‘costing but a
drachma at the most’</i> (Apol. 26 D); <i>the intervals of a banquet were
filled up by conversation about the poets</i> (Protag. <a href="#stpage347C" class="pginternal">347 C</a>). <i>The quarrel
between philosophy and poetry was an ancient one, which had found its
first expression in the attacks of Xenophanes</i> (538 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) <i>and
Heracleitus</i> (508 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) <i>upon the popular mythology. In the earlier
dialogues of Plato the poets are treated with an ironical courtesy,
through which an antagonistic spirit is allowed here and there to
appear:  they are ‘winged and holy beings’</i> (Ion 534) <i>who sing by
inspiration,</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page367"></a>367</span> <i>but at the same time are the worst possible critics of their own
writings and the most self-conceited of mortals</i> (Apol. 22 D). <i>In the
Republic</i> (<i>II and III</i>), <i>Plato begins the trial of poetry by the
enquiry whether the tales and legends related by the epic and tragic
poets are true in themselves or likely to furnish good examples to
his future citizens. They cannot be true, for they are contrary to the
nature of God</i> (<i>see s. v.</i> <a href="#God" class="pginternal">God</a>), <i>and they are certainly not proper
lessons for youth. There must be a censorship of poetry, and all
objectionable passages expunged; suitable rules and regulations
will be laid down, and to these the poets must conform. In the Xth
Book the argument takes a deeper tone. The Poet is proved to be an
impostor thrice removed from the truth, a wizard who steals the hearts
of the unwary by his spells and enchantments. Men easily fall into
the habit of imitating what they admire; and the lamentations and woes
of the tragic hero and the unseemly buffoonery of the comedian are
equally bad models for the citizens of a free and noble state. The
poets must therefore be banished, unless, Plato adds, the lovers of
poetry can persuade us of her innocence of the charges laid against
her. In the Laws a similar conclusion is reached:—‘The state is an
imitation of the best life, and the noblest form of tragedy. The
legislator and the poet are rivals, and the latter can only be
tolerated if his words are in harmony with the laws of the state’</i>
(vii. 817)].

Soul. [<i>The psychology of the Republic,
while agreeing generally with that of the other Dialogues, is in some
respects a modification or developement of their conclusions.<br>—The
division of the soul into three elements, reason, spirit, appetite,
here first assumes a precise form, and henceforward has a permanent
place in the language of philosophy</i> (<i>cp.</i> Introd. <a href="#pagelxvii" class="pginternal">p. lxvii</a>). <i>On this
division the distinction between forms of government is based</i> (<i>see
s. v.</i> <a href="#Government" class="pginternal">Government</a>). <i>Virtue, again, is the harmony or accord of the
different elements, when the dictates of reason are enforced by
passion against the appetites, while vice is the anarchy or discord of
the soul when passion and appetite join in rebellion against reason</i>
(<i>cp.</i> 4. <a href="#stpage444A" class="pginternal">444</a>; 10. <a href="#stpage609A" class="pginternal">609</a> foll.; Soph. 228; Pol. 296 D; Laws 10. 906 C].<br>—<i>Regarded
 from the intellectual side the soul is analysed into four
faculties, reason, understanding, faith, knowledge of shadows. These
severally correspond to the four divisions of knowledge</i> (6. <a href="#stpage511E" class="pginternal">511 E</a>),
<i>two for intellect and two for opinion; and thus arises the Platonic
‘proportion,’</i>—<i>being</i> : <i>becoming</i> :: <i>intellect</i> : <i>opinion, and science</i>
: <i>belief</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page372"></a>372</span> :: <i>understanding</i> : <i>knowledge of shadows. These divisions are
partly real, partly formed by a logical process, which, as in so many
distinctions of ancient philosophers, has outrun fact, and are further
illustrated and explained by the allegory of the cave in Book VII</i> (<i>see</i>
Introduction, <a href="#pagexciv" class="pginternal">p. xciv</a>).<br>—<i>The pre-existence and the immortality of the
soul are assumed. The doctrine of</i> <span class="transl" title="a)na/mnêsis">ἀνάμνησις</span> <i>or ‘remembrance of a
previous birth’ is not so much dwelt upon as in the Meno, Phaedo,
or Phaedrus, neither is it made a proof of immortality</i> (Meno 86;
Phaedo 73). <i>It is apparently alluded to in the story of Er, where we
are told that ‘the pilgrims drank the waters of Unmindfulness; the
foolish took too deep a draught, but the wise were more moderate’</i> (10.
<a href="#stpage621A" class="pginternal">621 A</a>). <i>In the Xth Book Glaucon is supposed to receive with amazement
 Socrates’ confident assertion of immortality, although a previous allusion
 to another state of existence has passed unheeded</i> (6.
<a href="#stpage498D" class="pginternal">498 D</a>); <i>and in earlier parts of the discussion</i> (<i>e.g.</i> 2. <a href="#stpage362A" class="pginternal">362</a>; 3. <a href="#stpage386A" class="pginternal">386</a>),
<i>the censure which is passed on the common representations of Hades
implies in itself some belief in a future life</i> [<i>cp.</i> Introduction to
Phaedo, Vol. I]. <i>The argument for the immortality of the soul is
not drawn out at great length or with the emphasis of the Phaedo. It
is chiefly of a verbal character:—All things which perish are
destroyed by some inherent evil; but the soul is not destroyed by
sin, which is the evil proper to her, and must therefore be immortal</i>
(<i>cp.</i> Introd. <a href="#pageclxvi" class="pginternal">p. clxvi</a>).<br>—<i>The condition of the soul after death is
represented by Plato in his favourite form of a
myth</i> [<i>cp.</i> Meno 81; Phaedo 88; Gorg. 522]. <i>The Pamphylian warrior Er,
who is supposed to have died in battle, revives when placed on the
funeral pyre and relates his experiences in the other world. He tells
how the just are rewarded and the wicked punished, and is privileged
 to describe the spectacle which he had witnessed of the choice
of a new life by the pilgrim souls. The reward of release from bodily
existence is not held out to the philosopher</i> (Phaedo 114 C), <i>but his
wisdom, which has a deeper root than habit</i> (10. <a href="#stpage619A" class="pginternal">619</a>), <i>preserves him
from overhaste in his choice and ensures him a happy destiny.<br>—The
transmigration of souls is represented in the myth much as in the
Phaedrus and Timaeus. Plato in all likelihood derived the doctrine
from an Oriental source, but through Pythagorean channels. It probably
 had a real hold on his mind, as it agreed, or could be made to
agree, with the conviction, which he elsewhere expresses, of the remedial
 nature of punishment</i> [<i>cp.</i> Protag. 323; Gorg. 523–525].

state of the older or Spartan type, with some traits borrowed from
Athens,</i> II, <i>an ideal city in which the citizens have all things in
common, and the government is carried on by a class of philosopher
rulers who are selected by merit. These two elements are not perfectly
combined; and, as Aristotle complains</i> (Pol. ii. 5, § 18), <i>very much
is left ill-defined and uncertain.</i><br>—I. <i>Like Hellenic cities in general,
the number of the citizens is not to be great. The size of the state
is limited by the requirement that ‘it shall not be larger or smaller
than is consistent with unity.’</i> [<i>The ‘convenient number’ 5040,
which is</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page374"></a>374</span> <i>suggested in the Laws</i> (v. 737), <i>is regarded by Aristotle</i> (Pol. ii. 6,
§ 6) <i>as an ‘enormous multitude.’</i>] <i>Again, the individual is subordinate
to the state. When Adeimantus complains of the hard life which the
citizens will lead, ‘like mercenaries in a garrison’</i> (4. <a href="#stpage419A" class="pginternal">419</a>), <i>he is
answered by Socrates that if the happiness of the whole is secured,
the happiness of the parts will inevitably follow. Once more, war is
supposed to be the normal condition of the state, and military service
is imposed upon all. The profession of arms is the only one in which
the citizen may properly engage. Trade is regarded as dishonourable:—‘those
who are good for nothing else sit in the Agora buying and
selling’</i> (2. <a href="#stpage371D" class="pginternal">371 D</a>); <i>the warrior can spare no time for such an
employment</i> (<i>ib.</i> <a href="#stpage374C" class="pginternal">374 C</a>). [<i>In the Laws Plato’s ideas enlarge; he thinks
that peace is to be preferred to war</i> (1. 628); <i>and he speculates on
the possibility of redeeming trade from reproach by compelling some of
the best citizens to open a shop or keep a tavern</i> (11. 918).]—<i>In
 these respects, as well as in the introduction of common meals,
Plato was probably influenced by the traditional ideal of Sparta</i> [<i>cp.</i>
Introd. <a href="#pageclxx" class="pginternal">p. clxx</a>]. <i>The Athenian element appears in the intellectual
training of the citizens, and generally in the atmosphere of grace and
refinement which they are to breathe</i> (<i>see s. v.</i> <a href="#Art" class="pginternal">Art</a>). <i>The restless
energy of the Athenian
 character is perhaps reflected in the discipline imposed upon the
ruling class</i> (7. <a href="#stpage540A" class="pginternal">540</a>), <i>who when they have reached fifty are dispensed
 from continuous public service, but must then devote themselves
to abstract study, and also be willing to take their turn
when necessary at the helm of state</i> [<i>cp.</i> Laws 7. 807; Thucyd. i. 70;
ii. 40].<br>—II. <i>The most peculiar features of Plato’s state are</i> (1) <i>the
community of property,</i> (2) <i>the position of women,</i> (3) <i>the government
of philosophers.</i> (1)<i> The first</i> (<i>see <a href="#Community" class="pginternal">s. v.</a></i>), <i>though suggested in some
measure by the example of Sparta or Crete</i> [<i>cp.</i> Arist. Pol. ii. 5, § 6],
<i>is not known to have been actually practised anywhere in Hellas,
unless possibly among such a body as the Pythagorean brotherhood.</i>
(2) <i>Nothing in all the Republic was probably stranger to his
contemporaries than the place which Plato assigns to women in the
state. The community of wives and children, though carefully guarded
by him from the charge of licentiousness</i> (5. <a href="#stpage458E" class="pginternal">458 E</a>), <i>would appear
worse in Athenian eyes than the traditional ‘licence’ of the
Spartan women</i> [Arist. Pol. ii. 9, § 5), <i>which, so far as it really
existed, no doubt arose out of an excessive regard to physical
considerations in marriage. Again, the equal share in education, in
war, and in administration which the women are supposed to enjoy in
Plato’s state, was, if not so revolting, quite as contrary to common
Hellenic sentiment</i> [<i>cp.</i> Thucyd. ii. 45]. <i>The Spartan women exercised a
great influence on public affairs, but this was mainly indirect</i> [<i>cp.</i>
Laws 7. 806; Arist. Pol. ii. 9, § 8]; <i>they did not hold office or learn
the use of arms. At Athens, as is well known, the women, of the upper
classes at least, lived in an almost Oriental seclusion, and were
wholly absorbed in household duties</i> (Laws 7. 805 E). (3) <i>Finally,
the government of philosophers had no analogy in the Hellenic
world of</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page375"></a>375</span> <i>Plato’s time. He may have taken the suggestion from the
stories of the Pythagorean rule in Magna Graecia. But it is also possible that these
accounts of the brotherhood of Pythagoras, some of which have
reached us on very doubtful authority, may be themselves to a
considerable extent coloured and distorted by features adapted from
the Republic. Whether this is the case or not, we can hardly doubt
that Plato was chiefly indebted to his own imagination for his kingdom
of philosophers, or that it remained to himself an ideal, rather than
a state which would ever ‘play her part in actual life’</i> (Tim. 19,
20). <i>It is at least significant that he never finished the Critias,
as though he were unable to embody, even in a mythical form, the ‘city
of which the pattern is laid up in heaven.’</i>]

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the

of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
