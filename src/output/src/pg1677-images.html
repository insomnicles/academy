<h2>
      APPENDIX II.
    </h2>
<p>
      The two dialogues which are translated in the second appendix are not
      mentioned by Aristotle, or by any early authority, and have no claim to be
      ascribed to Plato. They are examples of Platonic dialogues to be assigned
      probably to the second or third generation after Plato, when his writings
      were well known at Athens and Alexandria. They exhibit considerable
      originality, and are remarkable for containing several thoughts of the
      sort which we suppose to be modern rather than ancient, and which
      therefore have a peculiar interest for us. The Second Alcibiades shows
      that the difficulties about prayer which have perplexed Christian
      theologians were not unknown among the followers of Plato. The Eryxias was
      doubted by the ancients themselves: yet it may claim the distinction of
      being, among all Greek or Roman writings, the one which anticipates in the
      most striking manner the modern science of political economy and gives an
      abstract form to some of its principal doctrines.
    </p>
<p>
      For the translation of these two dialogues I am indebted to my friend and
      secretary, Mr. Knight.
    </p>
<p>
      That the Dialogue which goes by the name of the Second Alcibiades is a
      genuine writing of Plato will not be maintained by any modern critic, and
      was hardly believed by the ancients themselves. The dialectic is poor and
      weak. There is no power over language, or beauty of style; and there is a
      certain abruptness and agroikia in the conversation, which is very
      un-Platonic. The best passage is probably that about the poets:—the
      remark that the poet, who is of a reserved disposition, is uncommonly
      difficult to understand, and the ridiculous interpretation of Homer, are
      entirely in the spirit of Plato (compare Protag; Ion; Apol.). The
      characters are ill-drawn. Socrates assumes the 'superior person' and
      preaches too much, while Alcibiades is stupid and heavy-in-hand. There are
      traces of Stoic influence in the general tone and phraseology of the
      Dialogue (compare opos melesei tis...kaka: oti pas aphron mainetai): and
      the writer seems to have been acquainted with the 'Laws' of Plato (compare
      Laws). An incident from the Symposium is rather clumsily introduced, and
      two somewhat hackneyed quotations (Symp., Gorg.) recur. The reference to
      the death of Archelaus as having occurred 'quite lately' is only a
      fiction, probably suggested by the Gorgias, where the story of Archelaus
      is told, and a similar phrase occurs;—ta gar echthes kai proen
      gegonota tauta, k.t.l. There are several passages which are either corrupt
      or extremely ill-expressed. But there is a modern interest in the subject
      of the dialogue; and it is a good example of a short spurious work, which
      may be attributed to the second or third century before Christ.

<h2>
      ALCIBIADES II
    </h2>
<p>
      PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: Socrates and Alcibiades.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Are you going, Alcibiades, to offer prayer to Zeus?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes, Socrates, I am.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: you seem to be troubled and to cast your eyes on the ground, as
      though you were thinking about something.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Of what do you suppose that I am thinking?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Of the greatest of all things, as I believe. Tell me, do you not
      suppose that the Gods sometimes partly grant and partly reject the
      requests which we make in public and private, and favour some persons and
      not others?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Do you not imagine, then, that a man ought to be very careful,
      lest perchance without knowing it he implore great evils for himself,
      deeming that he is asking for good, especially if the Gods are in the mood
      to grant whatever he may request? There is the story of Oedipus, for
      instance, who prayed that his children might divide their inheritance
      between them by the sword: he did not, as he might have done, beg that his
      present evils might be averted, but called down new ones. And was not his
      prayer accomplished, and did not many and terrible evils thence arise,
      upon which I need not dilate?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes, Socrates, but you are speaking of a madman: surely you do
      not think that any one in his senses would venture to make such a prayer?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Madness, then, you consider to be the opposite of discretion?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Of course.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And some men seem to you to be discreet, and others the
      contrary?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: They do.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Well, then, let us discuss who these are. We acknowledge that
      some are discreet, some foolish, and that some are mad?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And again, there are some who are in health?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: There are.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: While others are ailing?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And they are not the same?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Nor are there any who are in neither state?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: A man must either be sick or be well?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is my opinion.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Very good: and do you think the same about discretion and want
      of discretion?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: How do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Do you believe that a man must be either in or out of his
      senses; or is there some third or intermediate condition, in which he is
      neither one nor the other?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Decidedly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: He must be either sane or insane?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: So I suppose.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Did you not acknowledge that madness was the opposite of
      discretion?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And that there is no third or middle term between discretion and
      indiscretion?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And there cannot be two opposites to one thing?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: There cannot.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then madness and want of sense are the same?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That appears to be the case.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: We shall be in the right, therefore, Alcibiades, if we say that
      all who are senseless are mad. For example, if among persons of your own
      age or older than yourself there are some who are senseless,—as
      there certainly are,—they are mad. For tell me, by heaven, do you
      not think that in the city the wise are few, while the foolish, whom you
      call mad, are many?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I do.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But how could we live in safety with so many crazy people?
      Should we not long since have paid the penalty at their hands, and have
      been struck and beaten and endured every other form of ill-usage which
      madmen are wont to inflict? Consider, my dear friend: may it not be quite
      otherwise?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Why, Socrates, how is that possible? I must have been
      mistaken.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: So it seems to me. But perhaps we may consider the matter thus:—
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: How?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: I will tell you. We think that some are sick; do we not?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And must every sick person either have the gout, or be in a
      fever, or suffer from ophthalmia? Or do you believe that a man may labour
      under some other disease, even although he has none of these complaints?
      Surely, they are not the only maladies which exist?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And is every kind of ophthalmia a disease?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And every disease ophthalmia?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Surely not. But I scarcely understand what I mean myself.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Perhaps, if you give me your best attention, 'two of us' looking
      together, we may find what we seek.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I am attending, Socrates, to the best of my power.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: We are agreed, then, that every form of ophthalmia is a disease,
      but not every disease ophthalmia?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: We are.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And so far we seem to be right. For every one who suffers from a
      fever is sick; but the sick, I conceive, do not all have fever or gout or
      ophthalmia, although each of these is a disease, which, according to those
      whom we call physicians, may require a different treatment. They are not
      all alike, nor do they produce the same result, but each has its own
      effect, and yet they are all diseases. May we not take an illustration
      from the artizans?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: There are cobblers and carpenters and sculptors and others of
      all sorts and kinds, whom we need not stop to enumerate. All have their
      distinct employments and all are workmen, although they are not all of
      them cobblers or carpenters or sculptors.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No, indeed.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And in like manner men differ in regard to want of sense. Those
      who are most out of their wits we call 'madmen,' while we term those who
      are less far gone 'stupid' or 'idiotic,' or, if we prefer gentler
      language, describe them as 'romantic' or 'simple-minded,' or, again, as
      'innocent' or 'inexperienced' or 'foolish.' You may even find other names,
      if you seek for them; but by all of them lack of sense is intended. They
      only differ as one art appeared to us to differ from another or one
      disease from another. Or what is your opinion?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I agree with you.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then let us return to the point at which we digressed. We said
      at first that we should have to consider who were the wise and who the
      foolish. For we acknowledged that there are these two classes? Did we not?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: To be sure.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And you regard those as sensible who know what ought to be done
      or said?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: The senseless are those who do not know this?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: The latter will say or do what they ought not without their own
      knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Exactly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Oedipus, as I was saying, Alcibiades, was a person of this sort.
      And even now-a-days you will find many who (have offered inauspicious
      prayers), although, unlike him, they were not in anger nor thought that
      they were asking evil. He neither sought, nor supposed that he sought for
      good, but others have had quite the contrary notion. I believe that if the
      God whom you are about to consult should appear to you, and, in
      anticipation of your request, enquired whether you would be contented to
      become tyrant of Athens, and if this seemed in your eyes a small and mean
      thing, should add to it the dominion of all Hellas; and seeing that even
      then you would not be satisfied unless you were ruler of the whole of
      Europe, should promise, not only that, but, if you so desired, should
      proclaim to all mankind in one and the same day that Alcibiades, son of
      Cleinias, was tyrant:—in such a case, I imagine, you would depart
      full of joy, as one who had obtained the greatest of goods.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: And not only I, Socrates, but any one else who should meet
      with such luck.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Yet you would not accept the dominion and lordship of all the
      Hellenes and all the barbarians in exchange for your life?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not: for then what use could I make of them?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And would you accept them if you were likely to use them to a
      bad and mischievous end?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I would not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You see that it is not safe for a man either rashly to accept
      whatever is offered him, or himself to request a thing, if he is likely to
      suffer thereby or immediately to lose his life. And yet we could tell of
      many who, having long desired and diligently laboured to obtain a tyranny,
      thinking that thus they would procure an advantage, have nevertheless
      fallen victims to designing enemies. You must have heard of what happened
      only the other day, how Archelaus of Macedonia was slain by his beloved
      (compare Aristotle, Pol.), whose love for the tyranny was not less than
      that of Archelaus for him. The tyrannicide expected by his crime to become
      tyrant and afterwards to have a happy life; but when he had held the
      tyranny three or four days, he was in his turn conspired against and
      slain. Or look at certain of our own citizens,—and of their actions
      we have been not hearers, but eyewitnesses,—who have desired to
      obtain military command: of those who have gained their object, some are
      even to this day exiles from the city, while others have lost their lives.
      And even they who seem to have fared best, have not only gone through many
      perils and terrors during their office, but after their return home they
      have been beset by informers worse than they once were by their foes,
      insomuch that several of them have wished that they had remained in a
      private station rather than have had the glories of command. If, indeed,
      such perils and terrors were of profit to the commonwealth, there would be
      reason in undergoing them; but the very contrary is the case. Again, you
      will find persons who have prayed for offspring, and when their prayers
      were heard, have fallen into the greatest pains and sufferings. For some
      have begotten children who were utterly bad, and have therefore passed all
      their days in misery, while the parents of good children have undergone
      the misfortune of losing them, and have been so little happier than the
      others that they would have preferred never to have had children rather
      than to have had them and lost them. And yet, although these and the like
      examples are manifest and known of all, it is rare to find any one who has
      refused what has been offered him, or, if he were likely to gain aught by
      prayer, has refrained from making his petition. The mass of mankind would
      not decline to accept a tyranny, or the command of an army, or any of the
      numerous things which cause more harm than good: but rather, if they had
      them not, would have prayed to obtain them. And often in a short space of
      time they change their tone, and wish their old prayers unsaid. Wherefore
      also I suspect that men are entirely wrong when they blame the gods as the
      authors of the ills which befall them (compare Republic): 'their own
      presumption,' or folly (whichever is the right word)—
    </p>
<p>
      'Has brought these unmeasured woes upon them.' (Homer. Odyss.)
    </p>
<p>
      He must have been a wise poet, Alcibiades, who, seeing as I believe, his
      friends foolishly praying for and doing things which would not really
      profit them, offered up a common prayer in behalf of them all:—
    </p>
<p>
      'King Zeus, grant us good whether prayed for or unsought by us; But that
      which we ask amiss, do thou avert.' (The author of these lines, which are
      probably of Pythagorean origin, is unknown. They are found also in the
      Anthology (Anth. Pal.).)
    </p>
<p>
      In my opinion, I say, the poet spoke both well and prudently; but if you
      have anything to say in answer to him, speak out.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: It is difficult, Socrates, to oppose what has been well said.
      And I perceive how many are the ills of which ignorance is the cause,
      since, as would appear, through ignorance we not only do, but what is
      worse, pray for the greatest evils. No man would imagine that he would do
      so; he would rather suppose that he was quite capable of praying for what
      was best: to call down evils seems more like a curse than a prayer.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But perhaps, my good friend, some one who is wiser than either
      you or I will say that we have no right to blame ignorance thus rashly,
      unless we can add what ignorance we mean and of what, and also to whom and
      how it is respectively a good or an evil?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: How do you mean? Can ignorance possibly be better than
      knowledge for any person in any conceivable case?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: So I believe:—you do not think so?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And yet surely I may not suppose that you would ever wish to act
      towards your mother as they say that Orestes and Alcmeon and others have
      done towards their parent.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Good words, Socrates, prithee.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You ought not to bid him use auspicious words, who says that you
      would not be willing to commit so horrible a deed, but rather him who
      affirms the contrary, if the act appear to you unfit even to be mentioned.
      Or do you think that Orestes, had he been in his senses and knew what was
      best for him to do, would ever have dared to venture on such a crime?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Nor would any one else, I fancy?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: That ignorance is bad then, it would appear, which is of the
      best and does not know what is best?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: So I think, at least.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And both to the person who is ignorant and everybody else?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Let us take another case. Suppose that you were suddenly to get
      into your head that it would be a good thing to kill Pericles, your
      kinsman and guardian, and were to seize a sword and, going to the doors of
      his house, were to enquire if he were at home, meaning to slay only him
      and no one else:—the servants reply, 'Yes': (Mind, I do not mean
      that you would really do such a thing; but there is nothing, you think, to
      prevent a man who is ignorant of the best, having occasionally the whim
      that what is worst is best?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No.)
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES:—If, then, you went indoors, and seeing him, did not know
      him, but thought that he was some one else, would you venture to slay him?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Most decidedly not (it seems to me). (These words are omitted
      in several MSS.)
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: For you designed to kill, not the first who offered, but
      Pericles himself?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And if you made many attempts, and each time failed to recognize
      Pericles, you would never attack him?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Never.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Well, but if Orestes in like manner had not known his mother, do
      you think that he would ever have laid hands upon her?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: He did not intend to slay the first woman he came across, nor
      any one else's mother, but only his own?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Ignorance, then, is better for those who are in such a frame of
      mind, and have such ideas?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Obviously.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You acknowledge that for some persons in certain cases the
      ignorance of some things is a good and not an evil, as you formerly
      supposed?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I do.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And there is still another case which will also perhaps appear
      strange to you, if you will consider it? (The reading is here uncertain.)
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: What is that, Socrates?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: It may be, in short, that the possession of all the sciences, if
      unaccompanied by the knowledge of the best, will more often than not
      injure the possessor. Consider the matter thus:—Must we not, when we
      intend either to do or say anything, suppose that we know or ought to know
      that which we propose so confidently to do or say?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes, in my opinion.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: We may take the orators for an example, who from time to time
      advise us about war and peace, or the building of walls and the
      construction of harbours, whether they understand the business in hand, or
      only think that they do. Whatever the city, in a word, does to another
      city, or in the management of her own affairs, all happens by the counsel
      of the orators.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But now see what follows, if I can (make it clear to you). (Some
      words appear to have dropped out here.) You would distinguish the wise
      from the foolish?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: The many are foolish, the few wise?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And you use both the terms, 'wise' and 'foolish,' in reference
      to something?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I do.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Would you call a person wise who can give advice, but does not
      know whether or when it is better to carry out the advice?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Decidedly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Nor again, I suppose, a person who knows the art of war, but
      does not know whether it is better to go to war or for how long?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Nor, once more, a person who knows how to kill another or to
      take away his property or to drive him from his native land, but not when
      it is better to do so or for whom it is better?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But he who understands anything of the kind and has at the same
      time the knowledge of the best course of action:—and the best and
      the useful are surely the same?—
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES:—Such an one, I say, we should call wise and a useful
      adviser both of himself and of the city. What do you think?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I agree.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And if any one knows how to ride or to shoot with the bow or to
      box or to wrestle, or to engage in any other sort of contest or to do
      anything whatever which is in the nature of an art,—what do you call
      him who knows what is best according to that art? Do you not speak of one
      who knows what is best in riding as a good rider?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And in a similar way you speak of a good boxer or a good
      flute-player or a good performer in any other art?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But is it necessary that the man who is clever in any of these
      arts should be wise also in general? Or is there a difference between the
      clever artist and the wise man?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: All the difference in the world.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And what sort of a state do you think that would be which was
      composed of good archers and flute-players and athletes and masters in
      other arts, and besides them of those others about whom we spoke, who knew
      how to go to war and how to kill, as well as of orators puffed up with
      political pride, but in which not one of them all had this knowledge of
      the best, and there was no one who could tell when it was better to apply
      any of these arts or in regard to whom?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I should call such a state bad, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You certainly would when you saw each of them rivalling the
      other and esteeming that of the greatest importance in the state,
    </p>
<p>
      'Wherein he himself most excelled.' (Euripides, Antiope.) —I mean
      that which was best in any art, while he was entirely ignorant of what was
      best for himself and for the state, because, as I think, he trusts to
      opinion which is devoid of intelligence. In such a case should we not be
      right if we said that the state would be full of anarchy and lawlessness?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Decidedly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But ought we not then, think you, either to fancy that we know
      or really to know, what we confidently propose to do or say?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And if a person does that which he knows or supposes that he
      knows, and the result is beneficial, he will act advantageously both for
      himself and for the state?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And if he do the contrary, both he and the state will suffer?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Well, and are you of the same mind, as before?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I am.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But were you not saying that you would call the many unwise and
      the few wise?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I was.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And have we not come back to our old assertion that the many
      fail to obtain the best because they trust to opinion which is devoid of
      intelligence?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is the case.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: It is good, then, for the many, if they particularly desire to
      do that which they know or suppose that they know, neither to know nor to
      suppose that they know, in cases where if they carry out their ideas in
      action they will be losers rather than gainers?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: What you say is very true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Do you not see that I was really speaking the truth when I
      affirmed that the possession of any other kind of knowledge was more
      likely to injure than to benefit the possessor, unless he had also the
      knowledge of the best?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I do now, if I did not before, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: The state or the soul, therefore, which wishes to have a right
      existence must hold firmly to this knowledge, just as the sick man clings
      to the physician, or the passenger depends for safety on the pilot. And if
      the soul does not set sail until she have obtained this she will be all
      the safer in the voyage through life. But when she rushes in pursuit of
      wealth or bodily strength or anything else, not having the knowledge of
      the best, so much the more is she likely to meet with misfortune. And he
      who has the love of learning (Or, reading polumatheian, 'abundant
      learning.'), and is skilful in many arts, and does not possess the
      knowledge of the best, but is under some other guidance, will make, as he
      deserves, a sorry voyage:—he will, I believe, hurry through the
      brief space of human life, pilotless in mid-ocean, and the words will
      apply to him in which the poet blamed his enemy:—
    </p>
<p>
      '...Full many a thing he knew; But knew them all badly.' (A fragment from
      the pseudo-Homeric poem, 'Margites.')
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: How in the world, Socrates, do the words of the poet apply to
      him? They seem to me to have no bearing on the point whatever.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Quite the contrary, my sweet friend: only the poet is talking in
      riddles after the fashion of his tribe. For all poetry has by nature an
      enigmatical character, and it is by no means everybody who can interpret
      it. And if, moreover, the spirit of poetry happen to seize on a man who is
      of a begrudging temper and does not care to manifest his wisdom but keeps
      it to himself as far as he can, it does indeed require an almost
      superhuman wisdom to discover what the poet would be at. You surely do not
      suppose that Homer, the wisest and most divine of poets, was unaware of
      the impossibility of knowing a thing badly: for it was no less a person
      than he who said of Margites that 'he knew many things, but knew them all
      badly.' The solution of the riddle is this, I imagine:—By 'badly'
      Homer meant 'bad' and 'knew' stands for 'to know.' Put the words together;—the
      metre will suffer, but the poet's meaning is clear;—'Margites knew
      all these things, but it was bad for him to know them.' And, obviously, if
      it was bad for him to know so many things, he must have been a
      good-for-nothing, unless the argument has played us false.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: But I do not think that it has, Socrates: at least, if the
      argument is fallacious, it would be difficult for me to find another which
      I could trust.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And you are right in thinking so.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Well, that is my opinion.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But tell me, by Heaven:—you must see now the nature and
      greatness of the difficulty in which you, like others, have your part. For
      you change about in all directions, and never come to rest anywhere: what
      you once most strongly inclined to suppose, you put aside again and quite
      alter your mind. If the God to whose shrine you are going should appear at
      this moment, and ask before you made your prayer, 'Whether you would
      desire to have one of the things which we mentioned at first, or whether
      he should leave you to make your own request:'—what in either case,
      think you, would be the best way to take advantage of the opportunity?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Indeed, Socrates, I could not answer you without
      consideration. It seems to me to be a wild thing (The Homeric word margos
      is said to be here employed in allusion to the quotation from the
      'Margites' which Socrates has just made; but it is not used in the sense
      which it has in Homer.) to make such a request; a man must be very careful
      lest he pray for evil under the idea that he is asking for good, when
      shortly after he may have to recall his prayer, and, as you were saying,
      demand the opposite of what he at first requested.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And was not the poet whose words I originally quoted wiser than
      we are, when he bade us (pray God) to defend us from evil even though we
      asked for it?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I believe that you are right.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: The Lacedaemonians, too, whether from admiration of the poet or
      because they have discovered the idea for themselves, are wont to offer
      the prayer alike in public and private, that the Gods will give unto them
      the beautiful as well as the good:—no one is likely to hear them
      make any further petition. And yet up to the present time they have not
      been less fortunate than other men; or if they have sometimes met with
      misfortune, the fault has not been due to their prayer. For surely, as I
      conceive, the Gods have power either to grant our requests, or to send us
      the contrary of what we ask.
    </p>
<p>
      And now I will relate to you a story which I have heard from certain of
      our elders. It chanced that when the Athenians and Lacedaemonians were at
      war, our city lost every battle by land and sea and never gained a
      victory. The Athenians being annoyed and perplexed how to find a remedy
      for their troubles, decided to send and enquire at the shrine of Ammon.
      Their envoys were also to ask, 'Why the Gods always granted the victory to
      the Lacedaemonians?' 'We,' (they were to say,) 'offer them more and finer
      sacrifices than any other Hellenic state, and adorn their temples with
      gifts, as nobody else does; moreover, we make the most solemn and costly
      processions to them every year, and spend more money in their service than
      all the rest of the Hellenes put together. But the Lacedaemonians take no
      thought of such matters, and pay so little respect to the Gods that they
      have a habit of sacrificing blemished animals to them, and in various ways
      are less zealous than we are, although their wealth is quite equal to
      ours.' When they had thus spoken, and had made their request to know what
      remedy they could find against the evils which troubled them, the prophet
      made no direct answer,—clearly because he was not allowed by the God
      to do so;—but he summoned them to him and said: 'Thus saith Ammon to
      the Athenians: "The silent worship of the Lacedaemonians pleaseth me
      better than all the offerings of the other Hellenes."' Such were the words
      of the God, and nothing more. He seems to have meant by 'silent worship'
      the prayer of the Lacedaemonians, which is indeed widely different from
      the usual requests of the Hellenes. For they either bring to the altar
      bulls with gilded horns or make offerings to the Gods, and beg at random
      for what they need, good or bad. When, therefore, the Gods hear them using
      words of ill omen they reject these costly processions and sacrifices of
      theirs. And we ought, I think, to be very careful and consider well what
      we should say and what leave unsaid. Homer, too, will furnish us with
      similar stories. For he tells us how the Trojans in making their
      encampment,
    </p>
<p>
      'Offered up whole hecatombs to the immortals,'
    </p>
<p>
      and how the 'sweet savour' was borne 'to the heavens by the winds;
    </p>
<pre>
     'But the blessed Gods were averse and received it not.
     For exceedingly did they hate the holy Ilium,
     Both Priam and the people of the spear-skilled king.'
</pre>
<p>
      So that it was in vain for them to sacrifice and offer gifts, seeing that
      they were hateful to the Gods, who are not, like vile usurers, to be
      gained over by bribes. And it is foolish for us to boast that we are
      superior to the Lacedaemonians by reason of our much worship. The idea is
      inconceivable that the Gods have regard, not to the justice and purity of
      our souls, but to costly processions and sacrifices, which men may
      celebrate year after year, although they have committed innumerable crimes
      against the Gods or against their fellow-men or the state. For the Gods,
      as Ammon and his prophet declare, are no receivers of gifts, and they
      scorn such unworthy service. Wherefore also it would seem that wisdom and
      justice are especially honoured both by the Gods and by men of sense; and
      they are the wisest and most just who know how to speak and act towards
      Gods and men. But I should like to hear what your opinion is about these
      matters.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I agree, Socrates, with you and with the God, whom, indeed, it
      would be unbecoming for me to oppose.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Do you not remember saying that you were in great perplexity,
      lest perchance you should ask for evil, supposing that you were asking for
      good?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I do.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You see, then, that there is a risk in your approaching the God
      in prayer, lest haply he should refuse your sacrifice when he hears the
      blasphemy which you utter, and make you partake of other evils as well.
      The wisest plan, therefore, seems to me that you should keep silence; for
      your 'highmindedness'—to use the mildest term which men apply to
      folly—will most likely prevent you from using the prayer of the
      Lacedaemonians. You had better wait until we find out how we should behave
      towards the Gods and towards men.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: And how long must I wait, Socrates, and who will be my
      teacher? I should be very glad to see the man.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: It is he who takes an especial interest in you. But first of
      all, I think, the darkness must be taken away in which your soul is now
      enveloped, just as Athene in Homer removes the mist from the eyes of
      Diomede that
    </p>
<p>
      'He may distinguish between God and mortal man.'
    </p>
<p>
      Afterwards the means may be given to you whereby you may distinguish
      between good and evil. At present, I fear, this is beyond your power.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Only let my instructor take away the impediment, whether it
      pleases him to call it mist or anything else! I care not who he is; but I
      am resolved to disobey none of his commands, if I am likely to be the
      better for them.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And surely he has a wondrous care for you.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: It seems to be altogether advisable to put off the sacrifice
      until he is found.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You are right: that will be safer than running such a tremendous
      risk.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: But how shall we manage, Socrates?—At any rate I will
      set this crown of mine upon your head, as you have given me such excellent
      advice, and to the Gods we will offer crowns and perform the other
      customary rites when I see that day approaching: nor will it be long
      hence, if they so will.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: I accept your gift, and shall be ready and willing to receive
      whatever else you may proffer. Euripides makes Creon say in the play, when
      he beholds Teiresias with his crown and hears that he has gained it by his
      skill as the first-fruits of the spoil:—
    </p>
<p>
      'An auspicious omen I deem thy victor's wreath: For well thou knowest that
      wave and storm oppress us.'
    </p>
<p>
      And so I count your gift to be a token of good-fortune; for I am in no
      less stress than Creon, and would fain carry off the victory over your
      lovers.

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>


<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">

prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain

        • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right

fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™

or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
