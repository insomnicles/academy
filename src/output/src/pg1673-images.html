<h2>
      APPENDIX I.
    </h2>
<p>
      It seems impossible to separate by any exact line the genuine writings of
      Plato from the spurious. The only external evidence to them which is of
      much value is that of Aristotle; for the Alexandrian catalogues of a
      century later include manifest forgeries. Even the value of the
      Aristotelian authority is a good deal impaired by the uncertainty
      concerning the date and authorship of the writings which are ascribed to
      him. And several of the citations of Aristotle omit the name of Plato, and
      some of them omit the name of the dialogue from which they are taken.
      Prior, however, to the enquiry about the writings of a particular author,
      general considerations which equally affect all evidence to the
      genuineness of ancient writings are the following: Shorter works are more
      likely to have been forged, or to have received an erroneous designation,
      than longer ones; and some kinds of composition, such as epistles or
      panegyrical orations, are more liable to suspicion than others; those,
      again, which have a taste of sophistry in them, or the ring of a later
      age, or the slighter character of a rhetorical exercise, or in which a
      motive or some affinity to spurious writings can be detected, or which
      seem to have originated in a name or statement really occurring in some
      classical author, are also of doubtful credit; while there is no instance
      of any ancient writing proved to be a forgery, which combines excellence
      with length. A really great and original writer would have no object in
      fathering his works on Plato; and to the forger or imitator, the 'literary
      hack' of Alexandria and Athens, the Gods did not grant originality or
      genius. Further, in attempting to balance the evidence for and against a
      Platonic dialogue, we must not forget that the form of the Platonic
      writing was common to several of his contemporaries. Aeschines, Euclid,
      Phaedo, Antisthenes, and in the next generation Aristotle, are all said to
      have composed dialogues; and mistakes of names are very likely to have
      occurred. Greek literature in the third century before Christ was almost
      as voluminous as our own, and without the safeguards of regular
      publication, or printing, or binding, or even of distinct titles. An
      unknown writing was naturally attributed to a known writer whose works
      bore the same character; and the name once appended easily obtained
      authority. A tendency may also be observed to blend the works and opinions
      of the master with those of his scholars. To a later Platonist, the
      difference between Plato and his imitators was not so perceptible as to
      ourselves. The Memorabilia of Xenophon and the Dialogues of Plato are but
      a part of a considerable Socratic literature which has passed away. And we
      must consider how we should regard the question of the genuineness of a
      particular writing, if this lost literature had been preserved to us.
    </p>
<p>
      These considerations lead us to adopt the following criteria of
      genuineness: (1) That is most certainly Plato's which Aristotle attributes
      to him by name, which (2) is of considerable length, of (3) great
      excellence, and also (4) in harmony with the general spirit of the
      Platonic writings. But the testimony of Aristotle cannot always be
      distinguished from that of a later age (see above); and has various
      degrees of importance. Those writings which he cites without mentioning
      Plato, under their own names, e.g. the Hippias, the Funeral Oration, the
      Phaedo, etc., have an inferior degree of evidence in their favour. They
      may have been supposed by him to be the writings of another, although in
      the case of really great works, e.g. the Phaedo, this is not credible;
      those again which are quoted but not named, are still more defective in
      their external credentials. There may be also a possibility that Aristotle
      was mistaken, or may have confused the master and his scholars in the case
      of a short writing; but this is inconceivable about a more important work,
      e.g. the Laws, especially when we remember that he was living at Athens,
      and a frequenter of the groves of the Academy, during the last twenty
      years of Plato's life. Nor must we forget that in all his numerous
      citations from the Platonic writings he never attributes any passage found
      in the extant dialogues to any one but Plato. And lastly, we may remark
      that one or two great writings, such as the Parmenides and the Politicus,
      which are wholly devoid of Aristotelian (1) credentials may be fairly
      attributed to Plato, on the ground of (2) length, (3) excellence, and (4)
      accordance with the general spirit of his writings. Indeed the greater
      part of the evidence for the genuineness of ancient Greek authors may be
      summed up under two heads only: (1) excellence; and (2) uniformity of
      tradition—a kind of evidence, which though in many cases sufficient,
      is of inferior value.
    </p>
<p>
      Proceeding upon these principles we appear to arrive at the conclusion
      that nineteen-twentieths of all the writings which have ever been ascribed
      to Plato, are undoubtedly genuine. There is another portion of them,
      including the Epistles, the Epinomis, the dialogues rejected by the
      ancients themselves, namely, the Axiochus, De justo, De virtute,
      Demodocus, Sisyphus, Eryxias, which on grounds, both of internal and
      external evidence, we are able with equal certainty to reject. But there
      still remains a small portion of which we are unable to affirm either that
      they are genuine or spurious. They may have been written in youth, or
      possibly like the works of some painters, may be partly or wholly the
      compositions of pupils; or they may have been the writings of some
      contemporary transferred by accident to the more celebrated name of Plato,
      or of some Platonist in the next generation who aspired to imitate his
      master. Not that on grounds either of language or philosophy we should
      lightly reject them. Some difference of style, or inferiority of
      execution, or inconsistency of thought, can hardly be considered decisive
      of their spurious character. For who always does justice to himself, or
      who writes with equal care at all times? Certainly not Plato, who exhibits
      the greatest differences in dramatic power, in the formation of sentences,
      and in the use of words, if his earlier writings are compared with his
      later ones, say the Protagoras or Phaedrus with the Laws. Or who can be
      expected to think in the same manner during a period of authorship
      extending over above fifty years, in an age of great intellectual
      activity, as well as of political and literary transition? Certainly not
      Plato, whose earlier writings are separated from his later ones by as wide
      an interval of philosophical speculation as that which separates his later
      writings from Aristotle.
    </p>
<p>
      The dialogues which have been translated in the first Appendix, and which
      appear to have the next claim to genuineness among the Platonic writings,
      are the Lesser Hippias, the Menexenus or Funeral Oration, the First
      Alcibiades. Of these, the Lesser Hippias and the Funeral Oration are cited
      by Aristotle; the first in the Metaphysics, the latter in the Rhetoric.
      Neither of them are expressly attributed to Plato, but in his citation of
      both of them he seems to be referring to passages in the extant dialogues.
      From the mention of 'Hippias' in the singular by Aristotle, we may perhaps
      infer that he was unacquainted with a second dialogue bearing the same
      name. Moreover, the mere existence of a Greater and Lesser Hippias, and of
      a First and Second Alcibiades, does to a certain extent throw a doubt upon
      both of them. Though a very clever and ingenious work, the Lesser Hippias
      does not appear to contain anything beyond the power of an imitator, who
      was also a careful student of the earlier Platonic writings, to invent.
      The motive or leading thought of the dialogue may be detected in Xen.
      Mem., and there is no similar instance of a 'motive' which is taken from
      Xenophon in an undoubted dialogue of Plato. On the other hand, the
      upholders of the genuineness of the dialogue will find in the Hippias a
      true Socratic spirit; they will compare the Ion as being akin both in
      subject and treatment; they will urge the authority of Aristotle; and they
      will detect in the treatment of the Sophist, in the satirical reasoning
      upon Homer, in the reductio ad absurdum of the doctrine that vice is
      ignorance, traces of a Platonic authorship. In reference to the last point
      we are doubtful, as in some of the other dialogues, whether the author is
      asserting or overthrowing the paradox of Socrates, or merely following the
      argument 'whither the wind blows.' That no conclusion is arrived at is
      also in accordance with the character of the earlier dialogues. The
      resemblances or imitations of the Gorgias, Protagoras, and Euthydemus,
      which have been observed in the Hippias, cannot with certainty be adduced
      on either side of the argument. On the whole, more may be said in favour
      of the genuineness of the Hippias than against it.
    </p>
<p>
      The Menexenus or Funeral Oration is cited by Aristotle, and is interesting
      as supplying an example of the manner in which the orators praised 'the
      Athenians among the Athenians,' falsifying persons and dates, and casting
      a veil over the gloomier events of Athenian history. It exhibits an
      acquaintance with the funeral oration of Thucydides, and was, perhaps,
      intended to rival that great work. If genuine, the proper place of the
      Menexenus would be at the end of the Phaedrus. The satirical opening and
      the concluding words bear a great resemblance to the earlier dialogues;
      the oration itself is professedly a mimetic work, like the speeches in the
      Phaedrus, and cannot therefore be tested by a comparison of the other
      writings of Plato. The funeral oration of Pericles is expressly mentioned
      in the Phaedrus, and this may have suggested the subject, in the same
      manner that the Cleitophon appears to be suggested by the slight mention
      of Cleitophon and his attachment to Thrasymachus in the Republic; and the
      Theages by the mention of Theages in the Apology and Republic; or as the
      Second Alcibiades seems to be founded upon the text of Xenophon, Mem. A
      similar taste for parody appears not only in the Phaedrus, but in the
      Protagoras, in the Symposium, and to a certain extent in the Parmenides.
    </p>
<p>
      To these two doubtful writings of Plato I have added the First Alcibiades,
      which, of all the disputed dialogues of Plato, has the greatest merit, and
      is somewhat longer than any of them, though not verified by the testimony
      of Aristotle, and in many respects at variance with the Symposium in the
      description of the relations of Socrates and Alcibiades. Like the Lesser
      Hippias and the Menexenus, it is to be compared to the earlier writings of
      Plato. The motive of the piece may, perhaps, be found in that passage of
      the Symposium in which Alcibiades describes himself as self-convicted by
      the words of Socrates. For the disparaging manner in which Schleiermacher
      has spoken of this dialogue there seems to be no sufficient foundation. At
      the same time, the lesson imparted is simple, and the irony more
      transparent than in the undoubted dialogues of Plato. We know, too, that
      Alcibiades was a favourite thesis, and that at least five or six dialogues
      bearing this name passed current in antiquity, and are attributed to
      contemporaries of Socrates and Plato. (1) In the entire absence of real
      external evidence (for the catalogues of the Alexandrian librarians cannot
      be regarded as trustworthy); and (2) in the absence of the highest marks
      either of poetical or philosophical excellence; and (3) considering that
      we have express testimony to the existence of contemporary writings
      bearing the name of Alcibiades, we are compelled to suspend our judgment
      on the genuineness of the extant dialogue.
    </p>
<p>
      Neither at this point, nor at any other, do we propose to draw an absolute
      line of demarcation between genuine and spurious writings of Plato. They
      fade off imperceptibly from one class to another. There may have been
      degrees of genuineness in the dialogues themselves, as there are certainly
      degrees of evidence by which they are supported. The traditions of the
      oral discourses both of Socrates and Plato may have formed the basis of
      semi-Platonic writings; some of them may be of the same mixed character
      which is apparent in Aristotle and Hippocrates, although the form of them
      is different. But the writings of Plato, unlike the writings of Aristotle,
      seem never to have been confused with the writings of his disciples: this
      was probably due to their definite form, and to their inimitable
      excellence. The three dialogues which we have offered in the Appendix to
      the criticism of the reader may be partly spurious and partly genuine;
      they may be altogether spurious;—that is an alternative which must
      be frankly admitted. Nor can we maintain of some other dialogues, such as
      the Parmenides, and the Sophist, and Politicus, that no considerable
      objection can be urged against them, though greatly overbalanced by the
      weight (chiefly) of internal evidence in their favour. Nor, on the other
      hand, can we exclude a bare possibility that some dialogues which are
      usually rejected, such as the Greater Hippias and the Cleitophon, may be
      genuine. The nature and object of these semi-Platonic writings require
      more careful study and more comparison of them with one another, and with
      forged writings in general, than they have yet received, before we can
      finally decide on their character. We do not consider them all as genuine
      until they can be proved to be spurious, as is often maintained and still
      more often implied in this and similar discussions; but should say of some
      of them, that their genuineness is neither proven nor disproven until
      further evidence about them can be adduced. And we are as confident that
      the Epistles are spurious, as that the Republic, the Timaeus, and the Laws
      are genuine.
    </p>
<p>
      On the whole, not a twentieth part of the writings which pass under the
      name of Plato, if we exclude the works rejected by the ancients themselves
      and two or three other plausible inventions, can be fairly doubted by
      those who are willing to allow that a considerable change and growth may
      have taken place in his philosophy (see above). That twentieth debatable
      portion scarcely in any degree affects our judgment of Plato, either as a
      thinker or a writer, and though suggesting some interesting questions to
      the scholar and critic, is of little importance to the general reader.

<h2>
      INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
<p>
      The Lesser Hippias may be compared with the earlier dialogues of Plato, in
      which the contrast of Socrates and the Sophists is most strongly
      exhibited. Hippias, like Protagoras and Gorgias, though civil, is vain and
      boastful: he knows all things; he can make anything, including his own
      clothes; he is a manufacturer of poems and declamations, and also of
      seal-rings, shoes, strigils; his girdle, which he has woven himself, is of
      a finer than Persian quality. He is a vainer, lighter nature than the two
      great Sophists (compare Protag.), but of the same character with them, and
      equally impatient of the short cut-and-thrust method of Socrates, whom he
      endeavours to draw into a long oration. At last, he gets tired of being
      defeated at every point by Socrates, and is with difficulty induced to
      proceed (compare Thrasymachus, Protagoras, Callicles, and others, to whom
      the same reluctance is ascribed).
    </p>
<p>
      Hippias like Protagoras has common sense on his side, when he argues,
      citing passages of the Iliad in support of his view, that Homer intended
      Achilles to be the bravest, Odysseus the wisest of the Greeks. But he is
      easily overthrown by the superior dialectics of Socrates, who pretends to
      show that Achilles is not true to his word, and that no similar
      inconsistency is to be found in Odysseus. Hippias replies that Achilles
      unintentionally, but Odysseus intentionally, speaks falsehood. But is it
      better to do wrong intentionally or unintentionally? Socrates, relying on
      the analogy of the arts, maintains the former, Hippias the latter of the
      two alternatives...All this is quite conceived in the spirit of Plato, who
      is very far from making Socrates always argue on the side of truth. The
      over-reasoning on Homer, which is of course satirical, is also in the
      spirit of Plato. Poetry turned logic is even more ridiculous than
      'rhetoric turned logic,' and equally fallacious. There were reasoners in
      ancient as well as in modern times, who could never receive the natural
      impression of Homer, or of any other book which they read. The argument of
      Socrates, in which he picks out the apparent inconsistencies and
      discrepancies in the speech and actions of Achilles, and the final
      paradox, 'that he who is true is also false,' remind us of the
      interpretation by Socrates of Simonides in the Protagoras, and of similar
      reasonings in the first book of the Republic. The discrepancies which
      Socrates discovers in the words of Achilles are perhaps as great as those
      discovered by some of the modern separatists of the Homeric poems...
    </p>
<p>
      At last, Socrates having caught Hippias in the toils of the voluntary and
      involuntary, is obliged to confess that he is wandering about in the same
      labyrinth; he makes the reflection on himself which others would make upon
      him (compare Protagoras). He does not wonder that he should be in a
      difficulty, but he wonders at Hippias, and he becomes sensible of the
      gravity of the situation, when ordinary men like himself can no longer go
      to the wise and be taught by them.
    </p>
<p>
      It may be remarked as bearing on the genuineness of this dialogue: (1)
      that the manners of the speakers are less subtle and refined than in the
      other dialogues of Plato; (2) that the sophistry of Socrates is more
      palpable and unblushing, and also more unmeaning; (3) that many turns of
      thought and style are found in it which appear also in the other
      dialogues:—whether resemblances of this kind tell in favour of or
      against the genuineness of an ancient writing, is an important question
      which will have to be answered differently in different cases. For that a
      writer may repeat himself is as true as that a forger may imitate; and
      Plato elsewhere, either of set purpose or from forgetfulness, is full of
      repetitions. The parallelisms of the Lesser Hippias, as already remarked,
      are not of the kind which necessarily imply that the dialogue is the work
      of a forger. The parallelisms of the Greater Hippias with the other
      dialogues, and the allusion to the Lesser (where Hippias sketches the
      programme of his next lecture, and invites Socrates to attend and bring
      any friends with him who may be competent judges), are more than
      suspicious:—they are of a very poor sort, such as we cannot suppose
      to have been due to Plato himself. The Greater Hippias more resembles the
      Euthydemus than any other dialogue; but is immeasurably inferior to it.
      The Lesser Hippias seems to have more merit than the Greater, and to be
      more Platonic in spirit. The character of Hippias is the same in both
      dialogues, but his vanity and boasting are even more exaggerated in the
      Greater Hippias. His art of memory is specially mentioned in both. He is
      an inferior type of the same species as Hippodamus of Miletus (Arist.
      Pol.). Some passages in which the Lesser Hippias may be advantageously
      compared with the undoubtedly genuine dialogues of Plato are the
      following:—Less. Hipp.: compare Republic (Socrates' cunning in
      argument): compare Laches (Socrates' feeling about arguments): compare
      Republic (Socrates not unthankful): compare Republic (Socrates dishonest
      in argument).
    </p>
<p>
      The Lesser Hippias, though inferior to the other dialogues, may be
      reasonably believed to have been written by Plato, on the ground (1) of
      considerable excellence; (2) of uniform tradition beginning with Aristotle
      and his school. That the dialogue falls below the standard of Plato's
      other works, or that he has attributed to Socrates an unmeaning paradox
      (perhaps with the view of showing that he could beat the Sophists at their
      own weapons; or that he could 'make the worse appear the better cause'; or
      merely as a dialectical experiment)—are not sufficient reasons for
      doubting the genuineness of the work.

<div class="poetry">
<p>
        EUDICUS: Why are you silent, Socrates, after the magnificent display
        which Hippias has been making? Why do you not either refute his words,
        if he seems to you to have been wrong in any point, or join with us in
        commending him? There is the more reason why you should speak, because
        we are now alone, and the audience is confined to those who may fairly
        claim to take part in a philosophical discussion.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: I should greatly like, Eudicus, to ask Hippias the meaning of
        what he was saying just now about Homer. I have heard your father,
        Apemantus, declare that the Iliad of Homer is a finer poem than the
        Odyssey in the same degree that Achilles was a better man than Odysseus;
        Odysseus, he would say, is the central figure of the one poem and
        Achilles of the other. Now, I should like to know, if Hippias has no
        objection to tell me, what he thinks about these two heroes, and which
        of them he maintains to be the better; he has already told us in the
        course of his exhibition many things of various kinds about Homer and
        divers other poets.
      </p>
<p>
        EUDICUS: I am sure that Hippias will be delighted to answer anything
        which you would like to ask; tell me, Hippias, if Socrates asks you a
        question, will you answer him?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Indeed, Eudicus, I should be strangely inconsistent if I
        refused to answer Socrates, when at each Olympic festival, as I went up
        from my house at Elis to the temple of Olympia, where all the Hellenes
        were assembled, I continually professed my willingness to perform any of
        the exhibitions which I had prepared, and to answer any questions which
        any one had to ask.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Truly, Hippias, you are to be congratulated, if at every
        Olympic festival you have such an encouraging opinion of your own wisdom
        when you go up to the temple. I doubt whether any muscular hero would be
        so fearless and confident in offering his body to the combat at Olympia,
        as you are in offering your mind.
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: And with good reason, Socrates; for since the day when I first
        entered the lists at Olympia I have never found any man who was my
        superior in anything. (Compare Gorgias.)
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: What an ornament, Hippias, will the reputation of your wisdom
        be to the city of Elis and to your parents! But to return: what say you
        of Odysseus and Achilles? Which is the better of the two? and in what
        particular does either surpass the other? For when you were exhibiting
        and there was company in the room, though I could not follow you, I did
        not like to ask what you meant, because a crowd of people were present,
        and I was afraid that the question might interrupt your exhibition. But
        now that there are not so many of us, and my friend Eudicus bids me ask,
        I wish you would tell me what you were saying about these two heroes, so
        that I may clearly understand; how did you distinguish them?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: I shall have much pleasure, Socrates, in explaining to you more
        clearly than I could in public my views about these and also about other
        heroes. I say that Homer intended Achilles to be the bravest of the men
        who went to Troy, Nestor the wisest, and Odysseus the wiliest.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: O rare Hippias, will you be so good as not to laugh, if I find
        a difficulty in following you, and repeat my questions several times
        over? Please to answer me kindly and gently.
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: I should be greatly ashamed of myself, Socrates, if I, who
        teach others and take money of them, could not, when I was asked by you,
        answer in a civil and agreeable manner.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Thank you: the fact is, that I seemed to understand what you
        meant when you said that the poet intended Achilles to be the bravest of
        men, and also that he intended Nestor to be the wisest; but when you
        said that he meant Odysseus to be the wiliest, I must confess that I
        could not understand what you were saying. Will you tell me, and then I
        shall perhaps understand you better; has not Homer made Achilles wily?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Certainly not, Socrates; he is the most straight-forward of
        mankind, and when Homer introduces them talking with one another in the
        passage called the Prayers, Achilles is supposed by the poet to say to
        Odysseus:—
      </p>
<p>
        'Son of Laertes, sprung from heaven, crafty Odysseus, I will speak out
        plainly the word which I intend to carry out in act, and which will, I
        believe, be accomplished. For I hate him like the gates of death who
        thinks one thing and says another. But I will speak that which shall be
        accomplished.'
      </p>
<p>
        Now, in these verses he clearly indicates the character of the two men;
        he shows Achilles to be true and simple, and Odysseus to be wily and
        false; for he supposes Achilles to be addressing Odysseus in these
        lines.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Now, Hippias, I think that I understand your meaning; when you
        say that Odysseus is wily, you clearly mean that he is false?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Exactly so, Socrates; it is the character of Odysseus, as he is
        represented by Homer in many passages both of the Iliad and Odyssey.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And Homer must be presumed to have meant that the true man is
        not the same as the false?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Of course, Socrates.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And is that your own opinion, Hippias?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Certainly; how can I have any other?
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Well, then, as there is no possibility of asking Homer what he
        meant in these verses of his, let us leave him; but as you show a
        willingness to take up his cause, and your opinion agrees with what you
        declare to be his, will you answer on behalf of yourself and him?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: I will; ask shortly anything which you like.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Do you say that the false, like the sick, have no power to do
        things, or that they have the power to do things?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: I should say that they have power to do many things, and in
        particular to deceive mankind.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then, according to you, they are both powerful and wily, are
        they not?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And are they wily, and do they deceive by reason of their
        simplicity and folly, or by reason of their cunning and a certain sort
        of prudence?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: By reason of their cunning and prudence, most certainly.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then they are prudent, I suppose?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: So they are—very.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And if they are prudent, do they know or do they not know what
        they do?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Of course, they know very well; and that is why they do
        mischief to others.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And having this knowledge, are they ignorant, or are they
        wise?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Wise, certainly; at least, in so far as they can deceive.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Stop, and let us recall to mind what you are saying; are you
        not saying that the false are powerful and prudent and knowing and wise
        in those things about which they are false?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: To be sure.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And the true differ from the false—the true and the
        false are the very opposite of each other?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: That is my view.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then, according to your view, it would seem that the false are
        to be ranked in the class of the powerful and wise?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Assuredly.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And when you say that the false are powerful and wise in so
        far as they are false, do you mean that they have or have not the power
        of uttering their falsehoods if they like?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: I mean to say that they have the power.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: In a word, then, the false are they who are wise and have the
        power to speak falsely?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then a man who has not the power of speaking falsely and is
        ignorant cannot be false?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: You are right.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And every man has power who does that which he wishes at the
        time when he wishes. I am not speaking of any special case in which he
        is prevented by disease or something of that sort, but I am speaking
        generally, as I might say of you, that you are able to write my name
        when you like. Would you not call a man able who could do that?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And tell me, Hippias, are you not a skilful calculator and
        arithmetician?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes, Socrates, assuredly I am.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And if some one were to ask you what is the sum of 3
        multiplied by 700, you would tell him the true answer in a moment, if
        you pleased?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: certainly I should.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Is not that because you are the wisest and ablest of men in
        these matters?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And being as you are the wisest and ablest of men in these
        matters of calculation, are you not also the best?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: To be sure, Socrates, I am the best.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And therefore you would be the most able to tell the truth
        about these matters, would you not?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes, I should.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And could you speak falsehoods about them equally well? I must
        beg, Hippias, that you will answer me with the same frankness and
        magnanimity which has hitherto characterized you. If a person were to
        ask you what is the sum of 3 multiplied by 700, would not you be the
        best and most consistent teller of a falsehood, having always the power
        of speaking falsely as you have of speaking truly, about these same
        matters, if you wanted to tell a falsehood, and not to answer truly?
        Would the ignorant man be better able to tell a falsehood in matters of
        calculation than you would be, if you chose? Might he not sometimes
        stumble upon the truth, when he wanted to tell a lie, because he did not
        know, whereas you who are the wise man, if you wanted to tell a lie
        would always and consistently lie?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes, there you are quite right.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Does the false man tell lies about other things, but not about
        number, or when he is making a calculation?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: To be sure; he would tell as many lies about number as about
        other things.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then may we further assume, Hippias, that there are men who
        are false about calculation and number?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Who can they be? For you have already admitted that he who is
        false must have the ability to be false: you said, as you will remember,
        that he who is unable to be false will not be false?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes, I remember; it was so said.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And were you not yourself just now shown to be best able to
        speak falsely about calculation?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes; that was another thing which was said.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And are you not likewise said to speak truly about
        calculation?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Certainly.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then the same person is able to speak both falsely and truly
        about calculation? And that person is he who is good at calculation—the
        arithmetician?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Who, then, Hippias, is discovered to be false at calculation?
        Is he not the good man? For the good man is the able man, and he is the
        true man.
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: That is evident.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Do you not see, then, that the same man is false and also true
        about the same matters? And the true man is not a whit better than the
        false; for indeed he is the same with him and not the very opposite, as
        you were just now imagining.
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Not in that instance, clearly.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Shall we examine other instances?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Certainly, if you are disposed.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Are you not also skilled in geometry?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: I am.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Well, and does not the same hold in that science also? Is not
        the same person best able to speak falsely or to speak truly about
        diagrams; and he is—the geometrician?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: He and no one else is good at it?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes, he and no one else.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then the good and wise geometer has this double power in the
        highest degree; and if there be a man who is false about diagrams the
        good man will be he, for he is able to be false; whereas the bad is
        unable, and for this reason is not false, as has been admitted.
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: True.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Once more—let us examine a third case; that of the
        astronomer, in whose art, again, you, Hippias, profess to be a still
        greater proficient than in the preceding—do you not?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes, I am.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And does not the same hold of astronomy?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: True, Socrates.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And in astronomy, too, if any man be able to speak falsely he
        will be the good astronomer, but he who is not able will not speak
        falsely, for he has no knowledge.
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Clearly not.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then in astronomy also, the same man will be true and false?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: It would seem so.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And now, Hippias, consider the question at large about all the
        sciences, and see whether the same principle does not always hold. I
        know that in most arts you are the wisest of men, as I have heard you
        boasting in the agora at the tables of the money-changers, when you were
        setting forth the great and enviable stores of your wisdom; and you said
        that upon one occasion, when you went to the Olympic games, all that you
        had on your person was made by yourself. You began with your ring, which
        was of your own workmanship, and you said that you could engrave rings;
        and you had another seal which was also of your own workmanship, and a
        strigil and an oil flask, which you had made yourself; you said also
        that you had made the shoes which you had on your feet, and the cloak
        and the short tunic; but what appeared to us all most extraordinary and
        a proof of singular art, was the girdle of your tunic, which, you said,
        was as fine as the most costly Persian fabric, and of your own weaving;
        moreover, you told us that you had brought with you poems, epic, tragic,
        and dithyrambic, as well as prose writings of the most various kinds;
        and you said that your skill was also pre-eminent in the arts which I
        was just now mentioning, and in the true principles of rhythm and
        harmony and of orthography; and if I remember rightly, there were a
        great many other accomplishments in which you excelled. I have forgotten
        to mention your art of memory, which you regard as your special glory,
        and I dare say that I have forgotten many other things; but, as I was
        saying, only look to your own arts—and there are plenty of them—and
        to those of others; and tell me, having regard to the admissions which
        you and I have made, whether you discover any department of art or any
        description of wisdom or cunning, whichever name you use, in which the
        true and false are different and not the same: tell me, if you can, of
        any. But you cannot.
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Not without consideration, Socrates.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Nor will consideration help you, Hippias, as I believe; but
        then if I am right, remember what the consequence will be.
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: I do not know what you mean, Socrates.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: I suppose that you are not using your art of memory, doubtless
        because you think that such an accomplishment is not needed on the
        present occasion. I will therefore remind you of what you were saying:
        were you not saying that Achilles was a true man, and Odysseus false and
        wily?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: I was.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And now do you perceive that the same person has turned out to
        be false as well as true? If Odysseus is false he is also true, and if
        Achilles is true he is also false, and so the two men are not opposed to
        one another, but they are alike.
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: O Socrates, you are always weaving the meshes of an argument,
        selecting the most difficult point, and fastening upon details instead
        of grappling with the matter in hand as a whole. Come now, and I will
        demonstrate to you, if you will allow me, by many satisfactory proofs,
        that Homer has made Achilles a better man than Odysseus, and a truthful
        man too; and that he has made the other crafty, and a teller of many
        untruths, and inferior to Achilles. And then, if you please, you shall
        make a speech on the other side, in order to prove that Odysseus is the
        better man; and this may be compared to mine, and then the company will
        know which of us is the better speaker.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: O Hippias, I do not doubt that you are wiser than I am. But I
        have a way, when anybody else says anything, of giving close attention
        to him, especially if the speaker appears to me to be a wise man. Having
        a desire to understand, I question him, and I examine and analyse and
        put together what he says, in order that I may understand; but if the
        speaker appears to me to be a poor hand, I do not interrogate him, or
        trouble myself about him, and you may know by this who they are whom I
        deem to be wise men, for you will see that when I am talking with a wise
        man, I am very attentive to what he says; and I ask questions of him, in
        order that I may learn, and be improved by him. And I could not help
        remarking while you were speaking, that when you recited the verses in
        which Achilles, as you argued, attacks Odysseus as a deceiver, that you
        must be strangely mistaken, because Odysseus, the man of wiles, is never
        found to tell a lie; but Achilles is found to be wily on your own
        showing. At any rate he speaks falsely; for first he utters these words,
        which you just now repeated,—
      </p>
<p>
        'He is hateful to me even as the gates of death who thinks one thing and
        says another:'—
      </p>
<p>
        And then he says, a little while afterwards, he will not be persuaded by
        Odysseus and Agamemnon, neither will he remain at Troy; but, says he,—
      </p>
<p>
        'To-morrow, when I have offered sacrifices to Zeus and all the Gods,
        having loaded my ships well, I will drag them down into the deep; and
        then you shall see, if you have a mind, and if such things are a care to
        you, early in the morning my ships sailing over the fishy Hellespont,
        and my men eagerly plying the oar; and, if the illustrious shaker of the
        earth gives me a good voyage, on the third day I shall reach the fertile
        Phthia.'
      </p>
<p>
        And before that, when he was reviling Agamemnon, he said,—
      </p>
<p>
        'And now to Phthia I will go, since to return home in the beaked ships
        is far better, nor am I inclined to stay here in dishonour and amass
        wealth and riches for you.'
      </p>
<p>
        But although on that occasion, in the presence of the whole army, he
        spoke after this fashion, and on the other occasion to his companions,
        he appears never to have made any preparation or attempt to draw down
        the ships, as if he had the least intention of sailing home; so nobly
        regardless was he of the truth. Now I, Hippias, originally asked you the
        question, because I was in doubt as to which of the two heroes was
        intended by the poet to be the best, and because I thought that both of
        them were the best, and that it would be difficult to decide which was
        the better of them, not only in respect of truth and falsehood, but of
        virtue generally, for even in this matter of speaking the truth they are
        much upon a par.
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: There you are wrong, Socrates; for in so far as Achilles speaks
        falsely, the falsehood is obviously unintentional. He is compelled
        against his will to remain and rescue the army in their misfortune. But
        when Odysseus speaks falsely he is voluntarily and intentionally false.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: You, sweet Hippias, like Odysseus, are a deceiver yourself.
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Certainly not, Socrates; what makes you say so?
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Because you say that Achilles does not speak falsely from
        design, when he is not only a deceiver, but besides being a braggart, in
        Homer's description of him is so cunning, and so far superior to
        Odysseus in lying and pretending, that he dares to contradict himself,
        and Odysseus does not find him out; at any rate he does not appear to
        say anything to him which would imply that he perceived his falsehood.
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: What do you mean, Socrates?
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Did you not observe that afterwards, when he is speaking to
        Odysseus, he says that he will sail away with the early dawn; but to
        Ajax he tells quite a different story?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Where is that?
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Where he says,—
      </p>
<p>
        'I will not think about bloody war until the son of warlike Priam,
        illustrious Hector, comes to the tents and ships of the Myrmidons,
        slaughtering the Argives, and burning the ships with fire; and about my
        tent and dark ship, I suspect that Hector, although eager for the
        battle, will nevertheless stay his hand.'
      </p>
<p>
        Now, do you really think, Hippias, that the son of Thetis, who had been
        the pupil of the sage Cheiron, had such a bad memory, or would have
        carried the art of lying to such an extent (when he had been assailing
        liars in the most violent terms only the instant before) as to say to
        Odysseus that he would sail away, and to Ajax that he would remain, and
        that he was not rather practising upon the simplicity of Odysseus, whom
        he regarded as an ancient, and thinking that he would get the better of
        him by his own cunning and falsehood?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: No, I do not agree with you, Socrates; but I believe that
        Achilles is induced to say one thing to Ajax, and another to Odysseus in
        the innocence of his heart, whereas Odysseus, whether he speaks falsely
        or truly, speaks always with a purpose.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then Odysseus would appear after all to be better than
        Achilles?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Certainly not, Socrates.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Why, were not the voluntary liars only just now shown to be
        better than the involuntary?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: And how, Socrates, can those who intentionally err, and
        voluntarily and designedly commit iniquities, be better than those who
        err and do wrong involuntarily? Surely there is a great excuse to be
        made for a man telling a falsehood, or doing an injury or any sort of
        harm to another in ignorance. And the laws are obviously far more severe
        on those who lie or do evil, voluntarily, than on those who do evil
        involuntarily.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: You see, Hippias, as I have already told you, how pertinacious
        I am in asking questions of wise men. And I think that this is the only
        good point about me, for I am full of defects, and always getting wrong
        in some way or other. My deficiency is proved to me by the fact that
        when I meet one of you who are famous for wisdom, and to whose wisdom
        all the Hellenes are witnesses, I am found out to know nothing. For
        speaking generally, I hardly ever have the same opinion about anything
        which you have, and what proof of ignorance can be greater than to
        differ from wise men? But I have one singular good quality, which is my
        salvation; I am not ashamed to learn, and I ask and enquire, and am very
        grateful to those who answer me, and never fail to give them my grateful
        thanks; and when I learn a thing I never deny my teacher, or pretend
        that the lesson is a discovery of my own; but I praise his wisdom, and
        proclaim what I have learned from him. And now I cannot agree in what
        you are saying, but I strongly disagree. Well, I know that this is my
        own fault, and is a defect in my character, but I will not pretend to be
        more than I am; and my opinion, Hippias, is the very contrary of what
        you are saying. For I maintain that those who hurt or injure mankind,
        and speak falsely and deceive, and err voluntarily, are better far than
        those who do wrong involuntarily. Sometimes, however, I am of the
        opposite opinion; for I am all abroad in my ideas about this matter, a
        condition obviously occasioned by ignorance. And just now I happen to be
        in a crisis of my disorder at which those who err voluntarily appear to
        me better than those who err involuntarily. My present state of mind is
        due to our previous argument, which inclines me to believe that in
        general those who do wrong involuntarily are worse than those who do
        wrong voluntarily, and therefore I hope that you will be good to me, and
        not refuse to heal me; for you will do me a much greater benefit if you
        cure my soul of ignorance, than you would if you were to cure my body of
        disease. I must, however, tell you beforehand, that if you make a long
        oration to me you will not cure me, for I shall not be able to follow
        you; but if you will answer me, as you did just now, you will do me a
        great deal of good, and I do not think that you will be any the worse
        yourself. And I have some claim upon you also, O son of Apemantus, for
        you incited me to converse with Hippias; and now, if Hippias will not
        answer me, you must entreat him on my behalf.
      </p>
<p>
        EUDICUS: But I do not think, Socrates, that Hippias will require any
        entreaty of mine; for he has already said that he will refuse to answer
        no man.—Did you not say so, Hippias?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes, I did; but then, Eudicus, Socrates is always troublesome
        in an argument, and appears to be dishonest. (Compare Gorgias;
        Republic.)
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Excellent Hippias, I do not do so intentionally (if I did, it
        would show me to be a wise man and a master of wiles, as you would
        argue), but unintentionally, and therefore you must pardon me; for, as
        you say, he who is unintentionally dishonest should be pardoned.
      </p>
<p>
        EUDICUS: Yes, Hippias, do as he says; and for our sake, and also that
        you may not belie your profession, answer whatever Socrates asks you.
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: I will answer, as you request me; and do you ask whatever you
        like.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: I am very desirous, Hippias, of examining this question, as to
        which are the better—those who err voluntarily or involuntarily?
        And if you will answer me, I think that I can put you in the way of
        approaching the subject: You would admit, would you not, that there are
        good runners?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And there are bad runners?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And he who runs well is a good runner, and he who runs ill is
        a bad runner?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Very true.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And he who runs slowly runs ill, and he who runs quickly runs
        well?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then in a race, and in running, swiftness is a good, and
        slowness is an evil quality?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: To be sure.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Which of the two then is a better runner? He who runs slowly
        voluntarily, or he who runs slowly involuntarily?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: He who runs slowly voluntarily.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And is not running a species of doing?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Certainly.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And if a species of doing, a species of action?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then he who runs badly does a bad and dishonourable action in
        a race?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes; a bad action, certainly.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And he who runs slowly runs badly?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then the good runner does this bad and disgraceful action
        voluntarily, and the bad involuntarily?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: That is to be inferred.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then he who involuntarily does evil actions, is worse in a
        race than he who does them voluntarily?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes, in a race.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Well, but at a wrestling match—which is the better
        wrestler, he who falls voluntarily or involuntarily?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: He who falls voluntarily, doubtless.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And is it worse or more dishonourable at a wrestling match, to
        fall, or to throw another?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: To fall.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then, at a wrestling match, he who voluntarily does base and
        dishonourable actions is a better wrestler than he who does them
        involuntarily?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: That appears to be the truth.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And what would you say of any other bodily exercise—is
        not he who is better made able to do both that which is strong and that
        which is weak—that which is fair and that which is foul?—so
        that when he does bad actions with the body, he who is better made does
        them voluntarily, and he who is worse made does them involuntarily.
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes, that appears to be true about strength.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And what do you say about grace, Hippias? Is not he who is
        better made able to assume evil and disgraceful figures and postures
        voluntarily, as he who is worse made assumes them involuntarily?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: True.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then voluntary ungracefulness comes from excellence of the
        bodily frame, and involuntary from the defect of the bodily frame?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: True.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And what would you say of an unmusical voice; would you prefer
        the voice which is voluntarily or involuntarily out of tune?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: That which is voluntarily out of tune.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: The involuntary is the worse of the two?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And would you choose to possess goods or evils?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Goods.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And would you rather have feet which are voluntarily or
        involuntarily lame?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Feet which are voluntarily lame.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: But is not lameness a defect or deformity?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And is not blinking a defect in the eyes?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And would you rather always have eyes with which you might
        voluntarily blink and not see, or with which you might involuntarily
        blink?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: I would rather have eyes which voluntarily blink.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then in your own case you deem that which voluntarily acts
        ill, better than that which involuntarily acts ill?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes, certainly, in cases such as you mention.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And does not the same hold of ears, nostrils, mouth, and of
        all the senses—those which involuntarily act ill are not to be
        desired, as being defective; and those which voluntarily act ill are to
        be desired as being good?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: I agree.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And what would you say of instruments;—which are the
        better sort of instruments to have to do with?—those with which a
        man acts ill voluntarily or involuntarily? For example, had a man better
        have a rudder with which he will steer ill, voluntarily or
        involuntarily?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: He had better have a rudder with which he will steer ill
        voluntarily.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And does not the same hold of the bow and the lyre, the flute
        and all other things?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Very true.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And would you rather have a horse of such a temper that you
        may ride him ill voluntarily or involuntarily?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: I would rather have a horse which I could ride ill voluntarily.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: That would be the better horse?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then with a horse of better temper, vicious actions would be
        produced voluntarily; and with a horse of bad temper involuntarily?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Certainly.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And that would be true of a dog, or of any other animal?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And is it better to possess the mind of an archer who
        voluntarily or involuntarily misses the mark?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Of him who voluntarily misses.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: This would be the better mind for the purposes of archery?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then the mind which involuntarily errs is worse than the mind
        which errs voluntarily?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes, certainly, in the use of the bow.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And what would you say of the art of medicine;—has not
        the mind which voluntarily works harm to the body, more of the healing
        art?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then in the art of medicine the voluntary is better than the
        involuntary?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Well, and in lute-playing and in flute-playing, and in all
        arts and sciences, is not that mind the better which voluntarily does
        what is evil and dishonourable, and goes wrong, and is not the worse
        that which does so involuntarily?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: That is evident.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And what would you say of the characters of slaves? Should we
        not prefer to have those who voluntarily do wrong and make mistakes, and
        are they not better in their mistakes than those who commit them
        involuntarily?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And should we not desire to have our own minds in the best
        state possible?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And will our minds be better if they do wrong and make
        mistakes voluntarily or involuntarily?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: O, Socrates, it would be a monstrous thing to say that those
        who do wrong voluntarily are better than those who do wrong
        involuntarily!
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And yet that appears to be the only inference.
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: I do not think so.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: But I imagined, Hippias, that you did. Please to answer once
        more: Is not justice a power, or knowledge, or both? Must not justice,
        at all events, be one of these?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: But if justice is a power of the soul, then the soul which has
        the greater power is also the more just; for that which has the greater
        power, my good friend, has been proved by us to be the better.
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes, that has been proved.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And if justice is knowledge, then the wiser will be the juster
        soul, and the more ignorant the more unjust?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: But if justice be power as well as knowledge—then will
        not the soul which has both knowledge and power be the more just, and
        that which is the more ignorant be the more unjust? Must it not be so?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Clearly.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And is not the soul which has the greater power and wisdom
        also better, and better able to do both good and evil in every action?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Certainly.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: The soul, then, which acts ill, acts voluntarily by power and
        art—and these either one or both of them are elements of justice?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: That seems to be true.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And to do injustice is to do ill, and not to do injustice is
        to do well?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And will not the better and abler soul when it does wrong, do
        wrong voluntarily, and the bad soul involuntarily?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Clearly.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: And the good man is he who has the good soul, and the bad man
        is he who has the bad?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Yes.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then the good man will voluntarily do wrong, and the bad man
        involuntarily, if the good man is he who has the good soul?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: Which he certainly has.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Then, Hippias, he who voluntarily does wrong and disgraceful
        things, if there be such a man, will be the good man?
      </p>
<p>
        HIPPIAS: There I cannot agree with you.
      </p>
<p>
        SOCRATES: Nor can I agree with myself, Hippias; and yet that seems to be
        the conclusion which, as far as we can see at present, must follow from
        our argument. As I was saying before, I am all abroad, and being in
        perplexity am always changing my opinion. Now, that I or any ordinary
        man should wander in perplexity is not surprising; but if you wise men
        also wander, and we cannot come to you and rest from our wandering, the
        matter begins to be serious both to us and to you.

</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>


<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear

phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
