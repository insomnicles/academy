<h4>PREFACE</h4>
<p>If I have turned aside from Euripides for a moment
and attempted a translation of the great stage masterpiece
of Sophocles, my excuse must be the fascination
of this play, which has thrown its spell on me as on
many other translators. Yet I may plead also that
as a rule every diligent student of these great works
can add something to the discoveries of his predecessors,
and I think I have been able to bring out
a few new points in the old and much-studied
<i>Oedipus</i>, chiefly points connected with the dramatic
technique and the religious atmosphere.</p>
<p>Mythologists tell us that Oedipus was originally
a daemon haunting Mount Kithairon, and Jocasta a
form of that Earth-Mother who, as Aeschylus puts
it, "bringeth all things to being, and when she hath
reared them receiveth again their seed into her body"
(<i>Choephori</i>, 127: cf. Crusius, <i>Beiträge z. Gr. Myth</i>,
21). That stage of the story lies very far behind
the consciousness of Sophocles. But there does cling
about both his hero and his heroine a great deal of
very primitive atmosphere. There are traces in
Oedipus of the pre-hellenic Medicine King, the
<i>Basileus</i> who is also a <i>Theos</i>, and can make rain or
blue sky, pestilence or fertility. This explains many
things in the Priest's first speech, in the attitude
of the Chorus, and in Oedipus' own language after
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>the discovery. It partly explains the hostility of
Apollo, who is not a mere motiveless Destroyer but a
true Olympian crushing his Earth-born rival. And
in the same way the peculiar royalty of Jocasta,
which makes Oedipus at times seem not the King
but the Consort of the Queen, brings her near to
that class of consecrated queens described in Dr.
Frazer's <i>Lectures on the Kingship</i>, who are "honoured
as no woman now living on the earth."</p>
<p>The story itself, and the whole spirit in which
Sophocles has treated it, belong not to the fifth century
but to that terrible and romantic past from
which the fifth century poets usually drew their
material. The atmosphere of brooding dread, the
pollution, the curses; the "insane and beastlike
cruelty," as an ancient Greek commentator calls it,
of piercing the exposed child's feet in order to ensure
its death and yet avoid having actually murdered it
(<i>Schol. Eur. Phoen.</i>, 26); the whole treatment of the
parricide and incest, not as moral offences capable of
being rationally judged or even excused as unintentional,
but as monstrous and inhuman pollutions, the
last limit of imaginable horror: all these things take
us back to dark regions of pre-classical and even pre-homeric
belief. We have no right to suppose that
Sophocles thought of the involuntary parricide and
metrogamy as the people in his play do. Indeed, considering
the general tone of his contemporaries and
friends, we may safely assume that he did not. But
at any rate he has allowed no breath of later enlightenment
to disturb the primaeval gloom of his
atmosphere.</p>
<p>Does this in any way make the tragedy insincere?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>I think not. We know that people did feel and
think about "pollution" in the way which Sophocles
represents; and if they so felt, then the tragedy was
there.<br><br></p>
<p>I think these considerations explain the remarkable
absence from this play of any criticism of life or
any definite moral judgment. I know that some
commentators have found in it a "humble and unquestioning
piety," but I cannot help suspecting that
what they saw was only a reflection from their own
pious and unquestioning minds. Man is indeed
shown as a "plaything of Gods," but of Gods strangely
and incomprehensibly malignant, whose ways there
is no attempt to explain or justify. The original
story, indeed, may have had one of its roots in a
Theban "moral tale." Aelian (<i>Varia Historia</i>, 2, 7)
tells us that the exposure of a child was forbidden by
Theban Law. The state of feeling which produced
this law, against the immensely strong conception
of the <i>patria potestas</i>, may also have produced a folklore
story telling how a boy once was exposed, in
a peculiarly cruel way, by his wicked parents, and
how Heaven preserved him to take upon both of
them a vengeance which showed that the unnatural
father had no longer a father's sanctity nor the unnatural
mother a mother's. But, as far as Sophocles
is concerned, if anything in the nature of a criticism
of life has been admitted into the play at all, it
seems to be only a flash or two of that profound and
pessimistic arraignment of the ruling powers which
in other plays also opens at times like a sudden abyss
across the smooth surface of his art.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>There is not much philosophy in the <i>Oedipus</i>.
There is not, in comparison with other Greek plays,
much pure poetry. What there is, is drama; drama
of amazing grandeur and power. In respect of plot
no Greek play comes near it. It contains no doubt
a few points of unsophisticated technique such as
can be found in all ancient and nearly all modern
drama; for instance, the supposition that Oedipus
has never inquired into the death of his predecessor
on the throne. But such flaws are external, not
essential. On the whole, I can only say that the
work of translation has made me feel even more
strongly than before the extraordinary grip and
reality of the dialogue, the deftness of the construction,
and, except perhaps for a slight drop in the Creon
scene, the unbroken crescendo of tragedy from the
opening to the close.<br><br></p>
<p>Where plot-interest is as strong as it is in the
<i>Oedipus</i>, character-interest is apt to be comparatively
weak. Yet in this play every character is interesting,
vital, and distinct. Oedipus himself is selected by
Aristotle as the most effective kind of tragic hero,
because, first, he has been great and glorious, and
secondly he has not been "pre-eminently virtuous
or just." This is true in its way. Oedipus is too
passionate to be just; but he is at least noble in his
impetuosity, his devotion, and his absolute truthfulness.
It is important to realise that at the beginning
of the play he is prepared for an oracle commanding
him to die for his people (pp. 6, 7). And he never
thinks of refusing that "task" any more than he tries
to elude the doom that actually comes, or to conceal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>any fact that tells against him. If Oedipus had been
an ordinary man the play would have been a very
different and a much poorer thing.</p>
<p>Jocasta is a wonderful study. Euripides might
have brought her character out more explicitly and
more at length, but even he could not have made her
more living or more tragic, or represented more subtly
in her relation to Oedipus both the mother's protecting
love and the mother's authority. As for her
"impiety," of which the old commentaries used to
speak with much disapproval, the essential fact in her
life is that both her innocence and her happiness have,
as she believes, been poisoned by the craft of priests.
She and Laïus both "believed a bad oracle": her
terror and her love for her husband made her consent
to an infamous act of cruelty to her own child, an act
of which the thought sickens her still, and about
which she cannot, when she tries, speak the whole
truth. (See note on p. 42.) And after all her crime
was for nothing! The oracle proved to be a lie.
Never again will she believe a priest.</p>
<p>As to Tiresias, I wish to ask forgiveness for an unintelligent
criticism made twelve years ago in my
<i>Ancient Greek Literature</i>, p. 240. I assumed then,
what I fancy was a common assumption, that Tiresias
was a "sympathetic" prophet, compact of wisdom
and sanctity and all the qualities which beseem that
calling; and I complained that he did not consistently
act as such. I was quite wrong. Tiresias is not anything
so insipid. He is a study of a real type, and a
type which all the tragedians knew. The character
of the professional seer or "man of God" has in the
imagination of most ages fluctuated between two
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>poles. At one extreme are sanctity and superhuman
wisdom; at the other fraud and mental disease, self-worship
aping humility and personal malignity in the
guise of obedience to God. There is a touch of all
these qualities, good and bad alike, in Tiresias. He
seems to me a most life-like as well as a most dramatic
figure.</p>
<p>As to the Chorus, it generally plays a smaller part
in Sophocles than in Euripides and Aeschylus, and
the <i>Oedipus</i> forms no exception to that rule. It seems
to me that Sophocles was feeling his way towards a
technique which would have approached that of the
New Comedy or even the Elizabethan stage, and
would perhaps have done without a Chorus altogether.
In Aeschylus Greek tragedy had been a thing of
traditional forms and clear-cut divisions; the religious
ritual showed through, and the visible gods and the
disguised dancers were allowed their full value. And
Euripides in the matter of outward formalism went
back to the Aeschylean type and even beyond it:
prologue, chorus, messenger, visible god, all the traditional
forms were left clear-cut and undisguised and
all developed to full effectiveness on separate and
specific lines. But Sophocles worked by blurring his
structural outlines just as he blurs the ends of his
verses. In him the traditional divisions are all made
less distinct, all worked over in the direction of
greater naturalness, at any rate in externals. This
was a very great gain, but of course some price had to
be paid for it. Part of the price was that Sophocles
could never attempt the tremendous choric effects
which Euripides achieves in such plays as the <i>Bacchae</i>
and the <i>Trojan Women</i>. His lyrics, great as they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>sometimes are, move their wings less boldly. They
seem somehow tied to their particular place in the
tragedy, and they have not quite the strength to lift
the whole drama bodily aloft with them.... At
least that is my feeling. But I realise that this may
be only the complaint of an unskilful translator, blaming
his material for his own defects of vision.</p>
<p>In general, both in lyrics and in dialogue, I believe
I have allowed myself rather less freedom than in
translating Euripides. This is partly because the
writing of Euripides, being less business-like and
more penetrated by philosophic reflections and by
subtleties of technique, actually needs more thorough
re-casting to express it at all adequately; partly because
there is in Sophocles, amid all his passion and
all his naturalness, a certain severe and classic reticence,
which, though impossible really to reproduce by any
method, is less misrepresented by occasional insufficiency
than by habitual redundance.</p>
<p>I have asked pardon for an ill deed done twelve
years ago. I should like to end by speaking of a
benefit older still, and express something of the gratitude
I feel to my old master, Francis Storr, whose
teaching is still vivid in my mind and who first opened
my eyes to the grandeur of the <i>Oedipus</i>.</p>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>
<p>While Thebes was under the rule of <span class="smcap">Laïus</span> and <span class="smcap">Jocasta</span>
there appeared a strange and monstrous creature, "the
riddling Sphinx," "the She-Wolf of the woven song," who
in some unexplained way sang riddles of death and slew
the people of Thebes. <span class="smcap">Laïus</span> went to ask aid of the oracle
of Delphi, but was slain mysteriously on the road. Soon
afterwards there came to Thebes a young Prince of Corinth,
<span class="smcap">Oedipus</span>, who had left his home and was wandering. He
faced the Sphinx and read her riddle, whereupon she flung
herself from her rock and died. The throne being vacant
was offered to <span class="smcap">Oedipus</span>, and with it the hand of the Queen,
<span class="smcap">Jocasta</span>.</p>
<p>Some ten or twelve years afterwards a pestilence has
fallen on Thebes. At this point the play begins.</p>
<p><i>The date of the first production of the play is not known, but was
probably about the year 425 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></i></p>

<h2>OEDIPUS, KING OF THEBES</h2>
<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>—<i>Before the Palace of <span class="smcap">Oedipus</span> at Thebes. A
crowd of suppliants of all ages are waiting by the
altar in front and on the steps of the Palace; among
them the <span class="smcap">Priest of Zeus</span>. As the Palace door opens
and <span class="smcap">Oedipus</span> comes out all the suppliants with a cry
move towards him in attitudes of prayer, holding
out their olive branches, and then become still again

<span class="i0">A thing befell: strange was it, but no way</span>
<span class="i0">Meet for such wonder and such rage as mine.</span>

<span class="i0">Day I kept silence, but the morrow morn</span>
<span class="i0">I sought my parents, told that tale of scorn</span>
<span class="i0">And claimed the truth; and they rose in their pride</span>
<span class="i0">And smote the mocker.... Aye, they satisfied</span>
<span class="i0">All my desire; yet still the cavil gnawed</span>
<span class="i0">My heart, and still the story crept abroad.</span>
<span class="i1">At last I rose—my father knew not, nor</span>
<span class="i0">My mother—and went forth to Pytho's floor</span>
<span class="i0">To ask. And God in that for which I came</span>
<span class="i0">Rejected me, but round me, like a flame,</span>
<span class="i0">His voice flashed other answers, things of woe,</span>

<span class="i0">Fled, fled from the dark south where Corinth lay,</span>
<span class="i0">To lands far off, where never I might see</span>
<span class="i0">My doom of scorn fulfilled. On bitterly</span>
<span class="i0">I strode, and reached the region where, so saith</span>
<span class="i0">Thy tale, that King of Thebes was struck to death....</span>
<span class="i0">Wife, I will tell thee true. As one in daze</span>
<span class="i0">I walked, till, at the crossing of three ways,</span>
<span class="i0">A herald, like thy tale, and o'er his head</span>
<span class="i0">A man behind strong horses charioted</span>
<span class="i0">Met me. And both would turn me from the path,</span>
<span class="i0">He and a thrall in front. And I in wrath</span>
<span class="i0">Smote him that pushed me—'twas a groom who led</span>
<span class="i0">The horses. Not a word the master said,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">vv. 808-828&nbsp;&nbsp;[Pg 47]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But watched, and as I passed him on the road</span>
<span class="i0">Down on my head his iron-branchèd goad</span>
<span class="i0">Stabbed. But, by heaven, he rued it! In a flash</span>
<span class="i0">I swung my staff and saw the old man crash</span>
<span class="i0">Back from his car in blood.... Then all of them</span>
<span class="i0">I slew.</span>
<span class="i5">Oh, if that man's unspoken name</span>
<span class="i0">Had aught of Laïus in him, in God's eye</span>

<h3>NOTES TO<br>
OEDIPUS, KING OF THEBES</h3>
<p><a href="#Page_4" class="pginternal">P. 4, l. 21:</a> Dry Ash of Ismênus.]—Divination by
burnt offerings was practised at an altar of Apollo by
the river Ismenus in Thebes.</p>
<p>Observe how many traits Oedipus retains of the
primitive king, who was at once chief and medicine-man
and god. The Priest thinks it necessary to state
explicitly that he does not regard Oedipus as a god,
but he is clearly not quite like other men. And it
seems as if Oedipus himself realised in this scene that
the oracle from Delphi might well demand the king's
life. Cf. p. 6, "what deed of mine, what bitter task,
May save my city"; p. 7, "any fear for mine own
death." This thought, present probably in more minds
than his, greatly increases the tension of the scene.
Cf. <i>Anthropology and the Classics</i>, pp. 74-79.]</p>
<p><a href="#Page_7" class="pginternal">P. 7, l. 87,</a> Message of joy.]—Creon says this for
the sake of the omen. The first words uttered at
such a crisis would be ominous and tend to fulfil
themselves.]</p>
<p><a href="#Page_13" class="pginternal">Pp. 13-16, ll. 216-275.</a> The long cursing speech
of Oedipus.]—Observe that this speech is broken into
several divisions, Oedipus at each point expecting
an answer and receiving none. Thus it is not mere
declamation; it involves action and reaction between
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
a speaker and a crowd.—Every reader will notice
how full it is of "tragic irony." Almost every paragraph
carries with it some sinister meaning of which
the speaker is unconscious. Cf. such phrases as "if
he tread my hearth," "had but his issue been more
fortunate," "as I would for mine own father," and
of course the whole situation.</p>
<p><a href="#Page_25" class="pginternal">P. 25, l. 437,</a> Who were they?]—This momentary
doubt of Oedipus, who of course regarded himself
as the son of Polybus, King of Corinth, is explained
later (p. 46, l. 780).</p>
<p><a href="#Page_29" class="pginternal">Pp. 29 ff.</a> The Creon scene.]—The only part of
the play which could possibly be said to flag. Creon's
defence, p. 34, "from probabilities," as the rhetoricians
would have called it, seems less interesting to us than
it probably did to the poet's contemporaries. It is
remarkably like Hippolytus's defence (pp. 52 f. of my
translation), and probably one was suggested by the
other. We cannot be sure which was the earlier
play.</p>
<p>The scene serves at least to quicken the pace of
the drama, to bring out the impetuous and somewhat
tyrannical nature of Oedipus, and to prepare the
magnificent entrance of Jocasta.</p>
<p><a href="#Page_36" class="pginternal">P. 36, l. 630</a>, Thebes is my country.]—It must
be remembered that to the Chorus Creon is a real
Theban, Oedipus a stranger from Corinth.</p>
<p><a href="#Page_41" class="pginternal">P. 41,</a> Conversation of Oedipus and Jocasta.]—The
technique of this wonderful scene, an intimate
self-revealing conversation between husband and wife
about the past, forming the pivot of the play, will
remind a modern reader of Ibsen.</p>
<p><a href="#Page_42" class="pginternal">P. 42, l. 718.</a>]—Observe that Jocasta does not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
tell the whole truth. It was she herself who gave
the child to be killed (p. 70, l. 1173).</p>
<p><a href="#Page_42" class="pginternal">P. 42, l. 730,</a> Crossing of Three Ways.]—Cross
roads always had dark associations. This particular
spot was well known to tradition and is still pointed
out. "A bare isolated hillock of grey stone stands
at the point where our road from Daulia meets the
road to Delphi and a third road that stretches to
the south.... The road runs up a frowning pass
between Parnassus on the right hand and the spurs
of the Helicon range on the left. Away to the south
a wild and desolate valley opens, running up among
the waste places of Helicon, a scene of inexpressible
grandeur and desolation" (Jebb, abridged).</p>
<p><a href="#Page_44" class="pginternal">P. 44, l. 754,</a> Who could bring, &amp;c.]—Oedipus of
course thought he had killed them all. See his next
speech.</p>
<p><a href="#Page_51" class="pginternal">P. 51.</a>]—Observe the tragic effect of this prayer.
Apollo means to destroy Jocasta, not to save her;
her prayer is broken across by the entry of the
Corinthian Stranger, which seems like a deliverance
but is really a link in the chain of destruction.
There is a very similar effect in Sophocles' <i>Electra</i>,
636-659, Clytaemnestra's prayer; compare also the
prayers to Cypris in Euripides' <i>Hippolytus</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#Page_51" class="pginternal">P. 51, l. 899.</a>]—Abae was an ancient oracular
shrine in Boeotia; Olympia in Elis was the seat of
the Olympian Games and of a great Temple of Zeus.</p>
<p><a href="#Page_52" class="pginternal">P. 52, l. 918,</a> O Slayer of the Wolf, O Lord of
Light.]—The names Lykeios, Lykios, &amp;c., seem to
have two roots, one meaning "Wolf" and the other
"Light."</p>
<p><a href="#Page_56" class="pginternal">P. 56, l. 987,</a> Thy father's tomb Like light across
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
our darkness.]—This ghastly line does not show hardness
of heart, it shows only the terrible position in
which Oedipus and Jocasta are. Naturally Oedipus
would give thanks if his father was dead. Compare
his question above, p. 54, l. 960, "Not murdered?"—He
cannot get the thought of the fated murder out
of his mind.</p>
<p><a href="#Page_57" class="pginternal">P. 57, l. 994.</a>]—Why does Oedipus tell the Corinthian
this oracle, which he has kept a secret even
from his wife till to-day?—Perhaps because, if there
is any thought of his going back to Corinth, his long
voluntary exile must be explained. Perhaps, too, the
secret possesses his mind so overpoweringly that it
can hardly help coming out.</p>
<p><a href="#Page_57" class="pginternal">Pp. 57, 58, ll. 1000-1020.</a>]—It is natural that the
Corinthian hesitates before telling a king that he is
really not of royal birth.</p>
<p><a href="#Page_64" class="pginternal">Pp. 64, 65, ll. 1086-1109.</a>]—This joyous Chorus
strikes a curious note. Of course it forms a good
contrast with what succeeds, but how can the Elders
take such a serenely happy view of the discovery that
Oedipus is a foundling just after they have been alarmed
at the exit of Jocasta? It seems as if the last
triumphant speech of Oedipus, "fey" and almost
touched with megalomania as it was, had carried the
feeling of the Chorus with it.</p>
<p><a href="#Page_66" class="pginternal">P. 66, l. 1122.</a>]—Is there any part in any tragedy so
short and yet so effective as that of this Shepherd?</p>
<p><a href="#Page_75" class="pginternal">P. 75, l. 1264</a>, Like a dead bird.]—The curious
word, [Greek: empeplêgmenên], seems to be taken from Odyssey
xxii. 469, where it is applied to birds caught in a snare.
As to the motives of Oedipus, his first blind instinct
to kill Jocasta as a thing that polluted the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
earth; when he saw her already dead, a revulsion
came.</p>
<p><a href="#Page_76" class="pginternal">P. 76, ll. 1305 ff</a>.]—Observe how a climax of
physical horror is immediately veiled and made beautiful
by lyrical poetry. Sophocles does not, however,
carry this plan of simply flooding the scene with
sudden beauty nearly so far as Euripides does. See
<i>Hipp.</i>, p. 39; <i>Trojan Women</i>, p. 51.</p>
<p><a href="#Page_83" class="pginternal">P. 83, ll. 1450 ff.</a>, Set me to live on the wild hills.]—These
lines serve to explain the conception, existing
in the poet's own time, of Oedipus as a daemon
or ghost haunting Mount Kithairon.</p>
<p><a href="#Page_86" class="pginternal">P. 86, l. 1520,</a> Creon.]—Amid all Creon's whole-hearted
forgiveness of Oedipus and his ready kindness
there are one or two lines of his which strike a
modern reader as tactless if not harsh. Yet I do not
think that Sophocles meant to produce that effect.
At the present day it is not in the best manners to
moralise over a man who is down, any more than
it is the part of a comforter to expound and insist
upon his friend's misfortunes. But it looks as if
ancient manners expected, and even demanded, both.
Cf. the attitude of Theseus to Adrastus in Eur.,
<i>Suppliants</i>.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
