<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>In 1869, having read the Antigone with a pupil who
at the time had a passion for the stage, I was led to
attempt a metrical version of the <i>Antigone</i>, and, by and
by, of the Electra and Trachiniae.<a class="fnref pginternal" href="#Pref1_fn_1">[1]</a> I had the satisfaction
of seeing this last very beautifully produced by an
amateur company in Scotland in 1877; when Mrs.
Fleeming Jenkin may be said to have ‘created’ the
part of Dêanira. Thus encouraged, I completed the
translation of the seven plays, which was published by
Kegan Paul in 1883 and again by Murray in 1896. I
have now to thank Mr. Murray for consenting to this
cheaper issue.</p>
<p>The seven extant plays of Sophocles have been
variously arranged. In the order most frequently
adopted by English editors, the three plays of the
Theban cycle, Oedipus Tyrannus, Oedipus Coloneus,
and Antigone, have been placed foremost.</p>
<p>In one respect this is obviously convenient, as appearing
to present continuously a connected story.
But on a closer view, it is in two ways illusory.</p>
<p>1. The Antigone is generally admitted to be, comparatively
speaking, an early play, while the Oedipus
Coloneus belongs to the dramatist’s latest manner;
the first Oedipus coming in somewhere between the
two. The effect is therefore analogous to that produced
on readers of Shakespeare by the habit of placing
Henry VI after Henry IV and V. But tragedies and
‘histories’ or chronicle plays are not <i>in pari materia</i>.</p>
<p>2. The error has been aggravated by a loose way of
speaking of ‘the Theban Trilogy’, a term which could
only be properly applicable if the three dramas had been
produced in the same year. I have therefore now
<span class="page2">[page xii]</span>
arranged the seven plays in an order corresponding to
the most probable dates of their production, viz. Antigone,
Aias, King Oedipus, Electra, Trachiniae, Philoctetes,
and Oedipus at Colonos. A credible tradition
refers the Antigone to 445 B.C. The Aias appears to
be not much later—it may even be earlier—than the
Antigone. The Philoctetes was produced in 408 B.C.,
when the poet was considerably over eighty. The
Oedipus at Colonos has always been believed to be a
composition of Sophocles’ old age. It is said to have
been produced after his death, though it may have
been composed some years earlier. The tragedy of
King Oedipus, in which the poet’s art attained its
maturity, is plausibly assigned to an early year of the
Peloponnesian war (say 427 B.C.), the Trachiniae to
about 420 B.C. The time of the Electra is doubtful;
but Professor Jebb has shown that, on metrical grounds,
it should be placed after, rather than before, King
Oedipus. Even the English reader, taking the plays
as they are grouped in this volume, may be aware of
a gradual change of manner, not unlike what is perceptible
in passing from Richard II to Macbeth, and from
Macbeth to The Winter’s Tale or Cymbeline. For
although the supposed date of the Antigone was long
subsequent to the poet’s first tragic victory, the forty
years over which the seven plays are spread saw many
changes of taste in art and literature.</p>

<h2>PREFATORY NOTE TO THE EDITION OF 1883</h2>
<p>I. The Hellenic spirit has been repeatedly characterized
as simple Nature-worship. Even the Higher
Paganism has been described as ‘in other words the
purified worship of natural forms.’<a class="fnref pginternal" href="#Pref2_fn_1">[1]</a> One might suppose,
in reading some modern writers, that the Nymphs
and Fauns, the River-Gods and Pan, were at least as
prominent in all Greek poetry as Zeus, Apollo, and
Athena, or that Apollo was only the sweet singer and
not also the prophet of retribution.</p>
<p>The fresh and unimpaired enjoyment of the Beautiful
is certainly the aspect of ancient life and literature
which most attracted the humanists of the sixteenth
century, and still most impresses those amongst ourselves
who for various reasons desire to point the contrast
between Paganism and Judaism. The two great
groups of forces vaguely known as the Renaissance and
the Revolution have both contributed to this result.
Men who were weary of conventionality and of the
weight of custom ‘heavy as frost and deep almost as
life,’ have longed for the vision of ‘Oread or Dryad
glancing through the shade,’ or to ‘hear old Triton
blow his wreathèd horn.’ Meanwhile, that in which the
Greeks most resembled us, ‘the human heart by which
we live,’ for the very reason that it lies so near to us,
is too apt to be lost from our conception of them.
Another cause of this one-sided view is the illusion produced
by the contemplation of statuary, together with
the unapproachable perfection of form which every relic
of Greek antiquity indisputably possesses.</p>
<p><span class="page2">[page xiv]</span>
But on turning from the forms of Greek art to the
substance of Greek literature, we find that Beauty,
although everywhere an important element, is by no
means the sole or even the chief attribute of the greatest
writings, nor is the Hellenic consciousness confined
within the life of Nature, unless this term is allowed to
comprehend man with all his thoughts and aspirations.
It was in this latter sense that Hegel recognized the
union of depth with brightness in Greek culture: ‘If
the first paradise was the paradise of nature, this is the
second, the higher paradise of the human spirit, which
in its fair naturalness, freedom, depth and brightness
here comes forth like a bride out of her chamber. The
first wild majesty of the rise of spiritual life in the East
is here circumscribed by the dignity of form, and softened
into beauty. Its depth shows itself no longer in confusion,
obscurity, and inflation, but lies open before us
in simple clearness. Its brightness (Heiterkeit) is not
a childish play, but covers a sadness which knows the
baldness of fate but is not by that knowledge driven out
of freedom and measure.’ Hegel’s Werke, vol. XVI.
p. 139 (translated by Prof. Caird). The simplicity of
Herodotus, for example, does not exclude far reaching
thoughts on the political advantages of liberty, nor such
reflections on experience as are implied in the saying
of Artabanus, that the transitoriness of human life is
the least of its evils. And in what modern writing is
more of the wisdom of life condensed than in the History
of Thucydides? It is surely more true to say of Greek
literature that it contains types of all things human,
stamped with the freshness, simplicity, and directness
which belong to first impressions, and to the first impressions
of genius.</p>
<p>Now the ‘thoughts and aspirations,’ which are nowhere
absent from Greek literature, and make a centre
of growing warmth and light in its Periclean period—when
the conception of human nature for the first time
takes definite shape—have no less of Religion in them
than underlay the ‘creed outworn’. To think otherwise
would be an error of the same kind as that ‘abuse
<span class="page2">[page xv]</span>
of the word Atheism’ against which the author of the
work above alluded to protests so forcibly.</p>
<p>Religion, in the sense here indicated, is the mainspring
and vital principle of Tragedy. The efforts of
Aeschylus and Sophocles were sustained by it, and its
inevitable decay through the scepticism which preceded
Socrates was the chief hindrance to the tragic genius of
Euripides. Yet the inequality of which we have consequently
to complain in him is redeemed by pregnant
hints of something yet ‘more deeply interfused,’ which
in him, as in his two great predecessors, is sometimes
felt as ‘modern,’ because it is not of an age but for all
time. The most valuable part of every literature is
something which transcends the period and nation out
of which it springs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, much that at first sight seems
primitive in Greek tragedy belongs more to the subject
than to the mode of handling. The age of Pericles was
in advance of that in which the legends were first
Hellenized and humanized, just as this must have been
already far removed from the earliest stages of mythopoeic
imagination. The reader of Aeschylus or Sophocles
should therefore be warned against attributing to
the poet’s invention that which is given in the fable.</p>
<p>An educated student of Italian painting knows how
to discriminate—say in an Assumption by Botticelli—between
the traditional conventions, the contemporary
ideas, and the refinements of the artist’s own fancy.
The same indulgence must be extended to dramatic art.
The tragedy of King Lear is not rude or primitive,
although the subject belongs to prehistoric times in
Britain. Nor is Goethe’s Faust mediaeval in spirit as
in theme. So neither is the Oedipus Rex the product
of ‘lawless and uncertain thoughts,’ notwithstanding
the unspeakable horror of the story, but is penetrated
by the most profound estimate of all in human life that
is saddest, and all that is most precious.</p>
<p>Far from being naive naturalists after the Keats
<span class="page2">[page xvi]</span>
fashion, the Greek tragic poets had succeeded to a
pessimistic reaction from simple Pagan enjoyment; they
were surrounded with gloomy questionings about human
destiny and Divine Justice, and they replied by looking
steadily at the facts of life and asserting the supreme
worth of innocence, equity, and mercy.</p>
<p>They were not philosophers, for they spoke the language
of feeling; but the civilization of which they
were the strongest outcome was already tinged with
influences derived from early philosophy—especially
from the gnomic wisdom of the sixth century and from
the spirit of theosophic speculation, which in Aeschylus
goes far even to recast mythology. The latter influence
was probably reinforced, through channels no longer
traceable, by the Eleusinian worship, in which the
mystery of life and death and of human sorrow had
replaced the primitive wonder at the phenomena of the
year.</p>
<p>And whatever elements of philosophic theory or
mystic exaltation the drama may have reflected, it was
still more emphatically the repository of some of the
most precious traditions of civilized humanity—traditions
which philosophy has sometimes tended to extenuate,
if not to destroy.</p>
<p>Plato’s Gorgias contains one of the most eloquent
vindications of the transcendent value of righteousness
and faithfulness as such. But when we ask, ‘Righteousness
in what relation?’—‘Faithfulness to whom?’—the
Gorgias is silent; and when the vacant outline is
filled up in the Republic, we are presented with an ideal
of man’s social relations, which, although it may be
regarded as the ultimate development of existing tendencies,
yet has no immediate bearing on any actual
condition of the world.</p>
<p>The ideal of the tragic poet may be less perfect; or
rather he does not attempt to set before us abstractedly
any single ideal. But the grand types of character
which he presents to the world are not merely imaginary.
They are creatures of flesh and blood, men and women,
to whom the unsullied purity of their homes, the freedom
<span class="page2">[page xvii]</span>
and power of their country, the respect and love
of their fellow-citizens, are inestimably dear. From a
Platonic, and still more from a Christian point of view,
the best morality of the age of Pericles is no doubt
defective. Such counsels of perfection as ‘Love your
enemies’, or ‘A good man can harm no one, not even
an enemy’,—are beyond the horizon of tragedy, unless
dimly seen in the person of Antigone. The coexistence
of savage vindictiveness with the most affectionate tenderness
is characteristic of heroes and heroines alike, and
produces some of the most moving contrasts. But the
tenderness is no less deep and real for this, and while
the chief persons are thus passionate, the Greek lesson
of moderation and reasonableness is taught by the
event, whether expressed or not by the mouth of sage
or prophet or of the ‘ideal bystander’.</p>
<p>Greek tragedy, then, is a religious art, not merely
because associated with the festival of Dionysus, nor
because the life which it represented was that of men
who believed, with all the Hellenes, in Zeus, Apollo,
and Athena, or in the power of Moira and the Erinyes,—not
merely because it represented</p>
<div class="poem"><span class="i3">‘the dread strife<br></span>
<span>Of poor humanity’s afflicted will<br></span>
<span>Struggling in vain with ruthless destiny,’<br></span></div>
<p>but much more because it awakened in the Athenian
spectator emotions of wonder concerning human life,
and of admiration for nobleness in the unfortunate—a
sense of the infinite value of personal uprightness and
of domestic purity—which in the most universal sense
of the word were truly religious,—because it expressed
a consciousness of depths which Plato never fathomed,
and an ideal of character which, if less complete than
Shakespeare’s, is not less noble. It is indeed a ‘rough’
generalization that ranks the Agamemnon with the
Adoniazusae as a religious composition.</p>
<p>II. This spiritual side of tragic poetry deserves to be
emphasized both as the most essential aspect of it, and
as giving it the most permanent claim to lasting recognition.
<span class="page2">[page xviii]</span>
And yet, apart from this, merely as dramas,
the works of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides will
never cease to be admired. These poets are teachers,
but they teach through art. To ask simply, as Carlyle
once did, ‘What did they think?’ is not the way to
understand or learn from them.</p>
<p>Considered simply as works of art, the plays of
Sophocles stand alone amongst dramatic writings in
their degree of concentration and complex unity.</p>
<p>1. The interest of a Sophoclean drama is always intensely
personal, and is almost always centred in an
individual destiny. In other words, it is not historical
or mythical, but ethical. Single persons stand out
magnificently in Aeschylus. But the action is always
larger than any single life. Each tragedy or trilogy
resembles the fragment of a sublime Epic poem. Mighty
issues revolve about the scene, whether this is laid on
Earth or amongst the Gods, issues far transcending
the fate of Orestes or even of Prometheus. In the perspective
painting of Sophocles, these vast surroundings
fall into the background, and the feelings of the spectator
are absorbed in sympathy with the chief figure
on the stage, round whom the other characters—the
members of the chorus being included—are grouped
with the minutest care.</p>
<p>2. In this grouping of the persons, as well as in the
conduct of the action, Sophocles is masterly in his use
of pathetic contrast. This motive must of course enter
into all tragedy—nothing can be finer than the contrast
of Cassandra to Clytemnestra in the Agamemnon,—but
in Sophocles it is all-pervading, and some of the minor
effects of it are so subtle that although inevitably felt
by the spectator they are often lost upon the mere
reader or student. And every touch, however transient,
is made to contribute to the main effect.</p>
<p>To recur once more to the much-abused analogy of
statuary:—the work of Aeschylus may be compared to
a colossal frieze, while that of Sophocles resembles the
pediment of a smaller temple. Or if, as in considering
the Orestean trilogy, the arrangement of the pediment
<span class="page2">[page xix]</span>
affords the more fitting parallel even for Aeschylus, yet
the forms are so gigantic that minute touches of characterization
and of contrast are omitted as superfluous.
Whereas in Sophocles, it is at once the finish of the chief
figure and the studied harmony of the whole, which
have led his work to be compared with that of his
contemporary Phidias. Such comparison, however, is
useful by way of illustration merely. It must never be
forgotten that, as Lessing pointed out to some who
thought the Philoctetes too sensational, analogies between
the arts are limited by essential differences of
material and of scope. All poetry represents successive
moments. Its figures are never in repose. And although
the action of Tragedy is concentrated and revolves
around a single point, yet it is a dull vision that confounds
rapidity of motion with rest.</p>
<p>3. Sophocles found the subjects of his dramas already
embodied not only in previous tragedies but in Epic and
Lyric poetry. And there were some fables, such as that
of the death of Oedipus at Colonos, which seem to have
been known to him only through oral tradition. For
some reason which is not clearly apparent, both he and
Aeschylus drew more largely from the Cyclic poets than
from ‘our Homer’. The inferior and more recent Epics,
which are now lost, were probably more episodical, and
thus presented a more inviting repertory of legends than
the Iliad and Odyssey.</p>
<p>Arctinus of Lesbos had treated at great length the
story of the House of Thebes. The legend of Orestes,
to which there are several allusions, not always consistent
with each other, in the Homeric poems, had been
a favourite and fruitful subject of tradition and of
poetical treatment in the intervening period. Passages
of the Tale of Troy, in which other heroes than Achilles
had the pre-eminence, had been elaborated by Lesches
and other Epic writers of the Post-Homeric time. The
voyage of the Argonauts, another favourite heroic
theme, supplied the subjects of many dramas which
have disappeared. Lastly, the taking of Oechalia by
<span class="page2">[page xx]</span>
Heracles, and the events which followed it, had been
narrated in a long poem, in which one version of that
hero’s multiform legend was fully set forth.</p>
<p>The subjects of the King Oedipus, Oedipus at
Colonos, and Antigone, are taken from the Tale of
Thebes, the Aias and the Philoctetes are founded on
incidents between the end of the Iliad and the taking
of Troy, the Electra represents the vengeance of
Orestes, the crowning event in the tale of ‘Pelops’
line’, the Trachiniae recounts the last crisis in the life
of Heracles.</p>
<p>4. Of the three Theban plays, the Antigone was first
composed, although its subject is the latest. Aeschylus
in the Seven against Thebes had already represented
the young heroine as defying the victorious citizens who
forbade the burial of her brother, the rebel Polynices.
He allowed her to be supported in her action by a band
of sympathizing friends. But in the play of Sophocles
she stands alone, and the power which she defies is not
that of the citizens generally, but of Creon, whose will
is absolute in the State. Thus the struggle is intensified,
and both her strength and her desolation become more
impressive, while the opposing claims of civic authority
and domestic piety are more vividly realized, because
either is separately embodied in an individual will. By
the same means the situation is humanized to the last
degree, and the heart of the spectator, although strained
to the uttermost with pity for the heroic maiden whose
life when full of brightest hopes was sacrificed to affection
and piety, has still some feeling left for the living
desolation of the man, whose patriotic zeal, degenerating
into tyranny, brought his city to the brink of ruin,
and cost him the lives of his two sons and of his wife,
whose dying curse, as well as that of Haemon, is denounced
upon him.</p>
<p>In the Oedipus Tyrannus, Sophocles goes back to the
central crisis of the Theban story. And again he fixes
our attention, not so much on the fortunes of the city,
or of the reigning house, as on the man Oedipus, his
glory and his fall.—</p>
<p><span class="page2">[page xxi]</span></p>
<div class="poem"><span>‘O mirror of our fickle state<br></span>
<span>Since man on earth unparalleled!<br></span>
<span>The rarer thy example stands,<br></span>
<span>By how much from the top of wondrous glory,<br></span>
<span>Strongest of mortal men,<br></span>
<span>To lowest pitch of abject fortune thou art fallen<a class="fnref pginternal" href="#Pref2_fn_2">[2]</a>.<br></span></div>
<p>The horror and the pity of it are both enhanced by
the character of Oedipus—his essential innocence, his
affectionateness, his uncalculating benevolence and
public spirit;—while his impetuosity and passionateness
make the sequel less incredible.</p>
<p>The essential innocence of Oedipus, which survives
the ruin of his hopes in this world, supplies the chief
motive of the Oedipus at Colonos. This drama, which
Sophocles is said to have written late in life, is in many
ways contrasted with the former Oedipus. It begins
with pity and horror, and ends with peace. It is only
in part founded on Epic tradition, the main incident
belonging apparently to the local mythology of the
poet’s birthplace. It also implies a later stage of ethical
reflection, and in this respect resembles the Philoctetes;
it depends more on lyrical and melodramatic effects,
and allows more room for collateral and subsidiary
motives than any other of the seven. Yet in its principal
theme, the vindication or redemption of an essentially
noble spirit from the consequences of error, it
repeats a note which had been struck much earlier in the
Aias with great force, although with some crudities of
treatment which are absent from the later drama.</p>
<p>5. In one of the Epic poems which narrated the fall of
Troy, the figure of Aias was more prominent than in the
Iliad. He alone and unassisted was there said to have
repulsed Hector from the ships, and he had the chief
share, although in this he was aided by Odysseus, in
rescuing the dead body of Achilles. Yet Achilles’
arms were awarded by the votes of the chieftains, as the
prize of valour, not to Aias, but to Odysseus. This, no
doubt, meant that wisdom is better than strength. But
<span class="page2">[page xxii]</span>
the wisdom of Odysseus in these later Epics was often
less nobly esteemed than in the Iliad and Odyssey, and
was represented as alloyed with cunning.</p>
<p>Aias has withdrawn with his Salaminians, in a rage,
from the fight, and after long brooding by the ships his
wrath has broken forth into a blaze which would have
endangered the lives of Odysseus and the Atridae, had
not Athena in her care for them changed his anger into
madness. Hence, instead of slaying the generals, he
makes havoc amongst the flocks and herds, which as
the result of various forays were the common property
of the whole army. The truth is discovered by Odysseus
with the help of Athena, and from being next to
Achilles in renown, Aias becomes the object of universal
scorn and hatred. The sequel of this hour of his downfall
is the subject of the Aias of Sophocles. After
lamenting his fate, the hero eludes the vigilance of his
captive bride Tecmessa, and of his Salaminian mariners,
and, in complete solitude, falls upon his sword. He is
found by Tecmessa and by his half-brother Teucer, who
has returned too late from a raid in the Mysian highlands.
The Atridae would prohibit Aias’ funeral; but Odysseus,
who has been specially enlightened by Athena,
advises generous forbearance, and his counsel prevails.
The part representing the disgrace and death of Aias is
more affecting to modern readers than the remainder of
the drama. But we should bear in mind that the vindication
of Aias after death, and his burial with undiminished
honours, had an absorbing interest for the
Athenian and Salaminian spectator.</p>
<p>Philoctetes also is rejected by man and accepted by
Destiny. The Argives in his case, as the Thebans in
the case of Oedipus, are blind to the real intentions of
the Gods.</p>
<p>The Philoctetes, like the Oedipus at Colonos, was a
work of Sophocles’ old age; and while it can hardly be
said that the fire of tragic feeling is abated in either of
these plays, dramatic effect is modified in both of them
by the influence of the poet’s contemplative mood. The
interest of the action in the Philoctetes is more inward
<span class="page2">[page xxiii]</span>
and psychological than in any other ancient drama.
The change of mind in Neoptolemus, the stubborn fixity
of will in Philoctetes, contrasted with the confiding
tenderness of his nature, form the elements of a dramatic
movement at once extremely simple and wonderfully
sustained. No purer ideal of virtuous youth has
been imagined than the son of Achilles, who in this play,
though sorely tempted, sets faithfulness before ambition.</p>
<p>6. In the Electra, which, though much earlier than the
Philoctetes, is still a work of his mature genius, our poet
appears at first sight to be in unequal competition with
Aeschylus. If the Theban trilogy of the elder poet had
remained entire, a similar impression might have been
produced by the Oedipus Tyrannus. It is best to lay
such comparisons aside, and to consider the work of
Sophocles simply on its own merits. The subject, as
he has chosen to treat it, is the heroic endurance of a
woman who devotes her life to the vindication of intolerable
wrongs done to her father, and the restoration
of her young brother to his hereditary rights. Hers is
the human agency which for this purpose works together
with Apollo. But the divine intention is concealed
from her. She suffers countless indignities from
her father’s enemies, of whom her own mother is the
chief. And, at length, all her hopes are shattered by
the false tidings that Orestes is no more. Even then
she does not relinquish her resolve. And the revulsion
from her deep sorrow to extremity of joy, when she finds
Orestes at her side and ready to perform the act of
vengeance in his own person, is irresistably affecting,
even when the play is only read.</p>
<p>Sophocles is especially great in the delineation of ideal
female characters. The heroic ardour of Antigone, and
the no less heroic persistence and endurance of Electra,
are both founded on the strength of their affection.
And the affection in both cases is what some moderns
too have called the purest of human feelings, the love of
a sister for a brother. Another aspect of that world-old
marvel, ‘the love of women,’ was presented in Aias’
captive bride, Tecmessa. This softer type also attains
<span class="page2">[page xxiv]</span>
to heroic grandeur in Dêanira, the wronged wife of
Heracles, whose fatal error is caused by the innocent
working of her wounded love.</p>
<p>It is strange that so acute a critic as A.W. Schlegel
should have doubted the Sophoclean authorship of the
Trachiniae. If its religious and moral lessons are even
less obtrusive than those of either Oedipus and of the
Antigone, there is no play which more directly pierces
to the very heart of humanity. And it is a superficial
judgement which complains that here at all events our
sympathies are distracted between the two chief persons,
Dêanira and Heracles. To one passion of his, to one
fond mistake of hers, the ruin of them both is due. Her
love has made their fates inseparable. And the spectator,
in sharing Hyllus’ grief, is afflicted for them both
at once. We may well recognize in this treatment of
the death of Heracles the hand of him who wrote—</p>

<p>7. It is unnecessary to expatiate here on the merits
of construction in which these seven plays are generally
acknowledged to be unrivalled; the natural way in
which the main situation is explained, the suddenness
and inevitableness of the complications, the steadily
sustained climax of emotion until the action culminates,
the preservation of the fitting mood until the end, the
subtlety and effectiveness of the minor contrasts of
situation and character<a class="fnref pginternal" href="#Pref2_fn_4">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>But it may not be irrelevant to observe that the
‘acting qualities’ of Sophocles, as of Shakespeare, are
<span class="page2">[page xxv]</span>
best known to those who have seen him acted, whether
in Greek, as by the students at Harvard<a class="fnref pginternal" href="#Pref2_fn_5">[5]</a> and Toronto<a class="fnref pginternal" href="#Pref2_fn_6">[6]</a>,
and more recently at Cambridge<a class="fnref pginternal" href="#Pref2_fn_7">[7]</a>, or in English long
ago by Miss Helen Faucit (since Lady Martin<a class="fnref pginternal" href="#Pref2_fn_8">[8]</a>), or still
earlier and repeatedly in Germany, or in the French
version of the Antigone by MM. Maurice and Vacquerie
(1845) or of King Oedipus by M. Lacroix, in
which the part of Œdipe Roi was finely sustained by
M. Geoffroy in 1861, and by M. Mounet Sully in 1881<a class="fnref pginternal" href="#Pref2_fn_9">[9]</a>.
With reference to the latter performance, which was
continued throughout the autumn season, M. Francisque
Sarcey wrote an article for the <i>Temps</i> newspaper of
August 15, 1881, which is full of just and vivid appreciation.
At the risk of seeming absurdly ‘modern’,
I will quote from this article some of the more striking
passages.</p>
<blockquote><div><p>‘Ce troisième et ce quatrième actes, les plus émouvants
qui se soient jamais produits sur aucune scène,
se composent d’une suite de narrations, qui viennent
l’une après l’autre frapper au cœur d’Œdipe, et qui ont
leur contrecoup dans l’âme des spectateurs. Je ne sais
qu’une pièce au monde qui soit construite de la sorte,
c’est l’<i>École des Femmes</i>. Ce rapprochement vous paraîtra
<span class="page2">[page xxvi]</span>
singulier, sans doute.... Mais ... c’est dans
le vieux drame grec comme dans la comédie du maître
français une trouvaille de génie....</p>
<p>‘Sophocle a voulu, après des émotions si terribles,
après des angoisses si sèches, ouvrir la source des larmes:
il a écrit un cinquième acte....</p>
<p>‘Les yeux crevés d’Œdipe ne sont qu’un accident, ou,
si vous aimez mieux, un accessoire, Le poète, sans
s’arrêter à ce détail, a mis sur les lèvres de son héros
toute la gamme des sentiments douloureux qu’excite
une si prodigieuse infortune....</p>
<p>‘À la lecture, elle est un pen longue cette scène de
lamentations. Au théâtre, on n’a pas le temps de la
trouver telle: on pleure de toute son âme et de tous ses
yeux. C’est qu’après avoir eu le cœur si longtemps
serré comme dans un étau, on épreuve comme un soulagement
à sentir en soi jaillir la source des larmes.
Sophocle, qui semble avoir été le plus malin des dramaturges,
comme il est le plus parfait des écrivains dramatiques,
a cherché là un effet de contraste dont l’effet est
immanquant sur le public.’</p></div></blockquote>
<p>These and other like remarks of one of the best-known
critics of the Parisian stage show that the dramatic art
of Sophocles is still a living power.</p>
<p>I am well aware how feeble and inadequate the present
attempted reproduction must appear to any reader who
knows the Greek original. There is much to be said for
the view of an eminent scholar who once declared that
he would never think of translating a Greek poet. But
the end of translating is not to satisfy fastidious
scholars, but to make the classics partially accessible to
those whose acquaintance with them would otherwise
be still more defective. Part of this version of Sophocles
was printed several years ago in an imperfect form.
The present volume contains the seven extant plays
entire. As the object has been to give the effect of
each drama as a whole, rather than to dwell on particular
‘beauties’ (which only a poet can render), the fragments
have not been included. But the reader should
<span class="page2">[page xxvii]</span>
bear in mind that the seven plays are less than a tithe
of the work produced by the poet in his lifetime.</p>
<p>It may very possibly be asked why verse has been
employed at all. Why not have listened to Carlyle’s
rough demand, ‘Tell us what they thought; none of
your silly poetry’? The present translator can only
reply that he began with prose, but soon found that, for
tragic dialogue in English, blank verse appeared a more
natural and effective vehicle than any prose style which
he could hope to frame. And with the dialogue in
verse, it was impossible to have the lyric parts in any
sort of prose, simply because the reader would then have
felt an intolerable incongruity. These parts have therefore
been turned into such familiar lyric measures as
seemed at once possible and not unsuitable. And
where this method was found impracticable, as sometimes
in the <i>Commoi</i>, blank metres have again been
used,—with such liberties as seemed appropriate to the
special purpose. The writer’s hope throughout has
been, not indeed fully to transfuse the poetry of Sophocles
into another tongue, but to make the poet’s dramatic
intention to be understood and felt by English
readers. One more such endeavour may possibly find
acceptance at a time when many causes have combined
to awaken a fresh interest at once in dramatic literature
and in Hellenic studies.</p>
<p>The reader who is hitherto unacquainted with the
Greek drama, should be warned that the parts assigned
to the ‘Chorus’ were often distributed among its
several members, who spoke or chanted, singly or in
groups, alternately or in succession. In some cases,
but not in all, <i>Ch. 1</i>, <i>Ch. 2</i>, &amp;c., have been prefixed, to
indicate such an arrangement.</p>

Polynices, son and heir to the unfortunate Oedipus,
having been supplanted by his younger brother Eteocles,
brought an army of Argives against his native city, Thebes.
The army was defeated, and the two brothers slew each
other in single combat. On this Creon, the brother-in-law
of Oedipus, succeeding to the chief power, forbade the
burial of Polynices. But Antigone, sister of the dead,
placing the dues of affection and piety before her obligation
to the magistrate, disobeyed the edict at the sacrifice of her
life. Creon carried out his will, but lost his son Haemon and
his wife Eurydice, and received their curses on his head.
His other son, Megareus, had previously been devoted as
a victim to the good of the state.</p>

When harm from foes threatens the souls we love?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ISMENE.</span>
No word of those we love, Antigone,<br>
Painful or glad, hath reached me, since we two<br>
Were utterly deprived of our two brothers,<br>
Cut off with mutual stroke, both in one day.<br>
And since the Argive host this now-past night<br>
Is vanished, I know nought beside to make me<br>
Nearer to happiness or more in woe.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>

Why, hath not Creon, in the burial-rite,<br>
Of our two brethren honoured one, and wrought<br>
On one foul wrong? Eteocles, they tell,<br>
With lawful consecration he lays out,<br>
And after covers him in earth, adorned<br>
With amplest honours in the world below.<br>
But Polynices, miserably slain,<br>
They say ’tis publicly proclaimed that none<br>
Must cover in a grave, nor mourn for him;<br>
But leave him tombless and unwept, a store<br>
Of sweet provision for the carrion fowl<br>
That eye him greedily. Such righteous law<br>
Good Creon hath pronounced for thy behoof—<br>

Ay, and for mine! I am not left out!—And now<br>
He moves this way to promulgate his will<br>
To such as have not heard, nor lightly holds<br>
The thing he bids, but, whoso disobeys,<br>
The citizens shall stone him to the death.<br>

My friends, the noble vessel of our State,<br>
After sore shaking her, the Gods have sped<br>
On a smooth course once more. I have called you hither,<br>
By special messengers selecting you<br>
From all the city, first, because I knew you<br>
Aye loyal to the throne of Laïus;<br>
Then, both while Oedipus gave prosperous days,<br>
And since his fall, I still beheld you firm<br>
In sound allegiance to the royal issue.<br>
Now since the pair have perished in an hour,<br>
Twinned in misfortune, by a mutual stroke<br>
Staining our land with fratricidal blood,<br>
All rule and potency of sovereign sway,<br>
In virtue of next kin to the deceased,<br>
Devolves on me. But hard it is to learn<br>
The mind of any mortal or the heart,<br>
Till he be tried in chief authority.<br>
Power shows the man. For he who when supreme<br>
Withholds his hand or voice from the best cause,<br>
Being thwarted by some fear, that man to me<br>
Appears, and ever hath appeared, most vile.<br>
He too hath no high place in mine esteem,<br>
Who sets his friend before his fatherland.<br>
Let Zeus whose eye sees all eternally<br>
Be here my witness. I will ne’er keep silence<br>
When danger lours upon my citizens<br>
Who looked for safety, nor make him my friend<br>
Who doth not love my country. For I know<br>
Our country carries us, and whilst her helm<br>
Is held aright we gain good friends and true.<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 9]</span><span class="linenum">[191-225]</span>
<span class="in2">Following such courses ’tis my steadfast will</span><br>
To foster Thebè’s greatness, and therewith<br>
In brotherly accord is my decree<br>
Touching the sons of Oedipus. The man—<br>
Eteocles I mean—who died for Thebes<br>
Fighting with eminent prowess on her side,<br>
Shall be entombed with every sacred rite<br>
That follows to the grave the lordliest dead.<br>
But for his brother, who, a banished man,<br>
Returned to devastate and burn with fire<br>
The land of his nativity, the shrines<br>
Of his ancestral gods, to feed him fat<br>
With Theban carnage, and make captive all<br>
That should escape the sword—for Polynices,<br>
This law hath been proclaimed concerning him:<br>
He shall have no lament, no funeral,<br>
But he unburied, for the carrion fowl<br>
And dogs to eat his corse, a sight of shame.<br>
<span class="in2">Such are the motions of this mind and will.</span><br>

Before the just. But whoso loves the State,<br>

And wheeled me to return. My mind discoursed<br>
Most volubly within my breast, and said—<br>
Fond wretch! why go where thou wilt find thy bane?<br>
Unhappy wight! say, wilt thou bide aloof?<br>
Then if the king shall hear this from another,<br>
How shalt thou ’scape for ’t? Winding thus about<br>
I hasted, but I could not speed, and so<br>
Made a long journey of a little way.<br>
At last ‘yes’ carried it, that I should come<br>
To thee; and tell thee I must needs; and shall,<br>
Though it be nothing that I have to tell.<br>
For I came hither, holding fast by this—<br>
Nought that is not my fate can happen to me.</p>

No dint of spade, or mattock-loosened sod,—<br>
Only the hard bare ground, untilled and trackless.<br>

And, when the scout of our first daylight watch<br>
Showed us the thing, we marvelled in dismay.<br>
The Prince was out of sight; not in a grave,<br>
But a thin dust was o’er him, as if thrown<br>

Appeared of any hound or beast o’ the field<br>

Having come near, or pulled at the dead body.<br>
Then rose high words among us sentinels<br>
With bickering noise accusing each his mate,<br>
And it seemed like to come to blows, with none<br>
To hinder. For the hand that thus had wrought<br>
Was any of ours, and none; the guilty man<br>
Escaped all knowledge. And we were prepared<br>
To lift hot iron with our bare palms; to walk<br>
Through fire, and swear by all the Gods at once<br>
That we were guiltless, ay, and ignorant<br>
Of who had plotted or performed this thing.<br>
<span class="in2">When further search seemed bootless, at the last</span><br>
One spake, whose words bowed all our heads to the earth<br>
With fear. We knew not what to answer him,<br>
Nor how to do it and prosper. He advised<br>
So grave a matter must not be concealed,<br>
But instantly reported to the King.<br>
<span class="in2">Well, this prevailed, and the lot fell on me,</span><br>
Unlucky man! to be the ministrant<br>
Of this fair service. So I am present here,<br>
Against my will and yours, I am sure of that.<br>
None love the bringer of unwelcome news.</p>

Cease, ere thou quite enrage me, and appear<br>
Foolish as thou art old. Talk not to me<br>

Say, was it for his benefits to them<br>
They hid his corse, and honoured him so highly,<br>
Who came to set on fire their pillared shrines,<br>
With all the riches of their offerings,<br>
And to make nothing of their land and laws?<br>
Or, hast thou seen them honouring villany?<br>
That cannot be. Long time the cause of this<br>
Hath come to me in secret murmurings<br>
From malcontents of Thebes, who under yoke<br>
Turned restive, and would not accept my sway.<br>
Well know I, these have bribed the watchmen here<br>

As money. This brings cities to their fall:<br>
This drives men homeless, and moves honest minds<br>
To base contrivings. This hath taught mankind<br>
The use of wickedness, and how to give<br>
An impious turn to every kind of act.<br>
But whosoe’er hath done this for reward<br>
Hath found his way at length to punishment.<br>
If Zeus have still my worship, be assured<br>
Of that which here on oath I say to thee—<br>
Unless ye find the man who made this grave<br>
And bring him bodily before mine eye,<br>
Death shall not be enough, till ye have hung<br>
Alive for an example of your guilt,<br>
That henceforth in your rapine ye may know<br>
Whence gain is to be gotten, and may learn<br>
Pelf from all quarters is not to be loved.<br>

My lord, no mortal should deny on oath,<br>
Judgement is still belied by after thought<br>
When quailing ’neath the tempest of your threats,<br>
Methought no force would drive me to this place<br>
But joy unlook’d for and surpassing hope<br>
Is out of bound the best of all delight,<br>
And so I am here again,—though I had sworn<br>

Caught in the act of caring for the dead<br>
Here was no lot throwing, this hap was mine<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 15]</span><span class="linenum">[397-430]</span>
Without dispute. And now, my sovereign lord,<br>

And how was she detected, caught, and taken?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">WATCH.</span>
It fell in this wise. We were come to the spot,<br>
Bearing the dreadful burden of thy threats;<br>
And first with care we swept the dust away<br>
From round the corse, and laid the dank limbs bare:<br>
Then sate below the hill-top, out o’ the wind,<br>
Where no bad odour from the dead might strike us,<br>
Stirring each other on with interchange<br>
Of loud revilings on the negligent<br>
In ’tendance on this duty. So we stayed<br>
Till in mid heaven the sun’s resplendent orb<br>
Stood high, and the heat strengthened. Suddenly,<br>
The Storm-god raised a whirlwind from the ground,<br>
Vexing heaven’s concave, and filled all the plain,<br>
Rending the locks of all the orchard groves,<br>
Till the great sky was choked withal. We closed<br>
Our lips and eyes, and bore the God-sent evil.<br>
When after a long while this ceased, the maid<br>
Was seen, and wailed in high and bitter key,<br>
Like some despairing bird that hath espied<br>
Her nest all desolate, the nestlings gone.<br>
So, when she saw the body bare, she mourned<br>
Loudly, and cursed the authors of this deed.<br>
Then nimbly with her hands she brought dry dust,<br>
And holding high a shapely brazen cruse,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 16]</span><span class="linenum">[431-467]</span>
Poured three libations, honouring the dead.<br>
We, when we saw, ran in, and straightway seized<br>
Our quarry, nought dismayed, and charged her with<br>
The former crime and this. And she denied<br>
Nothing;—to my delight, and to my grief.<br>
One’s self to escape disaster is great joy;<br>
Yet to have drawn a friend into distress<br>
Is painful. But mine own security<br>
To me is of more value than aught else.</p>

I heard it not from Heaven, nor came it forth<br>
From Justice, where she reigns with Gods below.<br>
They too have published to mankind a law.<br>
Nor thought I thy commandment of such might<br>
That one who is mortal thus could overbear<br>
The infallible, unwritten laws of Heaven.<br>
Not now or yesterday they have their being,<br>
But everlastingly, and none can tell<br>
The hour that saw their birth. I would not, I,<br>
For any terror of a man’s resolve,<br>
Incur the God-inflicted penalty<br>
Of doing them wrong. That death would come, I knew<br>
Without thine edict;—if before the time,<br>
I count it gain. Who does not gain by death,<br>
That lives, as I do, amid boundless woe?<br>
Slight is the sorrow of such doom to me.<br>
But had I suffered my own mother’s child,<br>
Fallen in blood, to be without a grave,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 17]</span><span class="linenum">[468-503]</span>

I count the younger of the twain no less<br>
Copartner in this plotted funeral:<br>
And now I bid you call her. Late I saw her<br>
Within the house, beyond herself, and frantic.<br>
—Full oft when one is darkly scheming wrong,<br>

In furious dissonance; and, I could tell,<br>
Talons were bloodily engaged—the whirr<br>
Of wings told a clear tale. At once, in fear,<br>
I tried burnt sacrifice at the high altar:<br>
Where from the offering the fire god refused<br>
To gleam; but a dank humour from the bones<br>
Dripped on the embers with a sputtering fume.<br>

Lay wasting, bared of their enclosing fat.<br>

Because our altars—yea, our sacred hearths—<br>

Our prayers and savour of the thigh-bone fat—<br>
And of ill presage is the thickening cry<br>

Ye men of Thebes, the tidings met mine ear<br>
As I was coming forth to visit Pallas<br>
With prayerful salutation. I was loosening<br>
The bar of the closed gate, when the sharp sound<br>
Of mine own sorrow smote against my heart,<br>
And I fell back astonied on my maids<br>
And fainted. But the tale? tell me once more;<br>
I am no novice in adversity.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MESS.</span>
Dear lady, I will tell thee what I saw,<br>
And hide no grain of truth: why should I soothe<br>
Thy spirit with soft tales, when the harsh fact<br>
Must prove me a liar? Truth is always best.<br>
I duly led the footsteps of thy lord<br>
To the highest point of the plain, where still was lying,<br>
Forlorn and mangled by the dogs, the corse<br>
Of Polynices. We besought Persephonè<br>
And Pluto gently to restrain their wrath,<br>
And wash’d him pure and clean, and then we burned<br>
The poor remains with brushwood freshly pulled,<br>
And heaped a lofty mound of his own earth<br>
Above him. Then we turned us to the vault,<br>
The maiden’s stony bride-chamber of death.<br>
And from afar, round the unhallowed cell,<br>
One heard a voice of wailing loud and long,<br>
And went and told his lord: who coming near<br>
Was haunted by the dim and bitter cry,<br>
And suddenly exclaiming on his fate<br>
Said lamentably, ‘My prophetic heart<br>
Divined aright. I am going, of all ways<br>
That e’er I went, the unhappiest to-day.<br>
My son’s voice smites me. Go, my men, approach<br>
With speed, and, where the stones are torn away,<br>
Press through the passage to that door of death,<br>
Look hard, and tell me, if I hear aright<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 37]</span><span class="linenum">[1218-1252]</span>
The voice of Haemon, or the gods deceive me.’<br>
Thus urged by our despairing lord, we made<br>
Th’ espial. And in the farthest nook of the vault<br>
We saw the maiden hanging by the neck<br>
With noose of finest tissue firmly tied,<br>
And clinging to her on his knees the boy,<br>
Lamenting o’er his ruined nuptial-rite,<br>
Consummated in death, his father’s crime<br>
And his lost love. And when the father saw him,<br>
With loud and dreadful clamour bursting in<br>
He went to him and called him piteously:<br>
‘What deed is this, unhappy youth? What thought<br>
O’ermaster’d thee? Where did the force of woe<br>
O’erturn thy reason? O come forth, my son,<br>
I beg thee!’ But with savage eyes the youth<br>
Glared scowling at him, and without a word<br>
Plucked forth his two-edged blade. The father then<br>
Fled and escaped: but the unhappy boy,<br>
Wroth with himself, even where he stood, leant heavily<br>
Upon his sword and plunged it in his side.—<br>
And while the sense remained, his slackening arm<br>
Enfolded still the maiden, and his breath,<br>
Gaspingly drawn and panted forth with pain,<br>
Cast ruddy drops upon her pallid face;<br>
Then lay in death upon the dead, at last<br>
Joined to his bride in Hades’ dismal hall:—<br>
A monument unto mankind, that rashness<br>

<p class="lftbrk">SCENE. Before the encampment of Aias on the shore
of the Troad. Afterwards a lonely place beyond

<i>‘A wounded spirit who can bear?’</i></p></div>
<p class="break">After the death of Achilles, the armour made for him by
Hephaestus was to be given to the worthiest of the surviving
Greeks. Although Aias was the most valiant, the judges
made the award to Odysseus, because he was the wisest.</p>
<p>Aias in his rage attempts to kill the generals; but
Athena sends madness upon him, and he makes a raid
upon the flocks and herds of the army, imagining the
bulls and rams to be the Argive chiefs. On awakening
from his delusion, he finds that he has fallen irrecoverably
from honour and from the favour of the Greeks. He also
imagines that the anger of Athena is unappeasable. Under
this impression he eludes the loving eyes of his captive-bride
Tecmessa, and of his Salaminian comrades, and falls
on his sword. (‘The soul and body rive not more in parting
Than greatness going off.’)</p>
<p>But it is revealed through the prophet Calchas, that the
wrath of Athena will last only for a day; and on the return
of Teucer, Aias receives an honoured funeral, the tyrannical
reclamations of the two sons of Atreus being overcome by
the firm fidelity of Teucer and the magnanimity of Odysseus,
who has been inspired for this purpose by Athena.</p>

The man is even but now come home, his head<br>

And with him Havoc ranged: while now he thought<br>
To kill the Atreidae with hot hand, now this<br>
Now that commander, as the fancy grew.<br>
I, joining with the tumult of his mind,<br>
Flung the wild victim on the fatal net.<br>

It toucheth you indeed, and ye shall hear<br>
All from the first. ’Twas midnight, and the lamp<br>
Of eve had died, when, seizing his sharp blade,<br>
He sought on some vain errand to creep forth.<br>
I broke in with my word: ‘Aias, what now?<br>
Why thus uncalled for salliest thou? No voice<br>
Of herald summoned thee. No trumpet blew.<br>
What wouldst thou when the camp is hushed in sleep?’<br>
He with few words well known to women’s ears<br>
Checked me: ‘The silent partner is the best.’<br>
I saw how ’twas and ceased. Forth then he fared<br>
Alone—What horror passed upon the plain<br>
This night, I know not. But he drags within,<br>
Tied in a throng, bulls, shepherd dogs, and spoil<br>
Of cattle and sheep. Anon he butchers them,<br>
Felling or piercing, hacking or tearing wide,<br>
Ribs from breast, limb from limb. Others in rage<br>
He seized and bound and tortured, brutes for men.<br>
Last, out he rushed before the doors, and there<br>
Whirled forth wild language to some shadowy form,<br>
Flouting the generals and Laërtes’ son<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 52]</span><span class="linenum">[303-341]</span>
With torrent laughter and loud triumphing<br>
What in his raid he had wreaked to their despite.<br>
Then diving back within—the fitful storm<br>
Slowly assuaging left his spirit clear.<br>
And when his eye had lightened through the room<br>
Cumbered with ruin, smiting on his brow<br>
He roared; and, tumbling down amid the wreck<br>
Of woolly carnage he himself had made,<br>
Sate with clenched hand tight twisted in his hair.<br>
Long stayed he so in silence. Then flashed forth<br>
Those frightful words of threatening vehemence,<br>
That bade me show him all the night’s mishap,<br>
And whither he was fallen I, dear my friends,<br>
Prevailed on through my fear, told all I knew.<br>
And all at once he raised a bitter cry,<br>
Which heretofore I ne’er had heard, for still<br>
He made us think such doleful utterance<br>
Betokened the dull craven spirit, and still<br>
Dumb to shrill wailings, he would only moan<br>
With half heard muttering, like an angry bull.<br>
But now, by such dark fortune overpowered,<br>
Foodless and dry, amid the quivering heap<br>
His steel hath quelled, all quietly he broods;<br>
And out of doubt his mind intends some harm:<br>
Such words, such groans, burst from him. O my friends.—<br>
Therefore I hastened,—enter and give aid<br>

Thy spear hath ruined. Fate—not thou—hath sent<br>

What wealth have I to comfort me for thee?<br>

Friends, my first news is Teucer’s presence here,<br>
Fresh from the Mysian heights; who, as he came<br>
Right toward the generals’ quarter, was assailed<br>
With outcry from the Argives in a throng:<br>
For when they knew his motion from afar<br>
They swarmed around him, and with shouts of blame<br>
From each side one and all assaulted him<br>
As brother to the man who had gone mad<br>
And plotted ’gainst the host,—threatening aloud,<br>
Spite of his strength, he should be stoned, and die.<br>
—So far strife ran, that swords unscabbarded<br>
Crossed blades, till as it mounted to the height<br>
Age interposed with counsel, and it fell.<br>
<span class="in2">But where is Aias to receive my word?</span><br>
Tidings are best told to the rightful ear.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
Not in the hut, but just gone forth, preparing<br>
New plans to suit his newly altered mind.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MESS.</span>
Alas!<br>
Too tardy then was he who sped me hither;<br>
Or I have proved too slow a messenger.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
What point is lacking for thine errand’s speed?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MESS.</span>
Teucer was resolute the man should bide<br>
Close held within-doors till himself should come.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
Why, sure his going took the happiest turn<br>
And wisest, to propitiate Heaven’s high wrath.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MESS.</span>
The height of folly lives in such discourse,<br>
If Calchas have the wisdom of a seer.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
What knowest thou of our state? What saith he? Tell.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MESS.</span>
I can tell only what I heard and saw.<br>
Whilst all the chieftains and the Atridae twain<br>
Were seated in a ring, Calchas alone<br>
Rose up and left them, and in Teucer’s palm<br>
Laid his right hand full friendly; then out-spake<br>
With strict injunction by all means i’ the world<br>
To keep beneath yon covert this one day<br>
Your hero, and not suffer him to rove,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 64]</span><span class="linenum">[755-789]</span>
If he would see him any more alive.<br>
For through this present light—and ne’er again—-<br>
Holy Athena, so he said, will drive him<br>
Before her anger. Such calamitous woe<br>
Strikes down the unprofitable growth that mounts<br>
Beyond his measure and provokes the sky.<br>
‘Thus ever,’ said the prophet, ‘must he fall<br>
Who in man’s mould hath thoughts beyond a man.<br>
And Aias, ere he left his father’s door,<br>
Made foolish answer to his prudent sire.<br>
<span class="in2">‘My son,’ said Telamon, ‘choose victory</span><br>
Always, but victory with an aid from Heaven.’<br>
How loftily, how madly, he replied!<br>
‘Father, with heavenly help men nothing worth<br>
May win success. But I am confident<br>
Without the Gods to pluck this glory down.’<br>
So huge the boast he vaunted! And again<br>
When holy Pallas urged him with her voice<br>
To hurl his deadly spear against the foe,<br>
He turned on her with speech of awful sound:<br>
<span class="in2">‘Goddess, by other Greeks take thou thy stand;</span><br>
Where I keep rank, the battle ne’er shall break.’<br>
Such words of pride beyond the mortal scope<br>
Have won him Pallas’ wrath, unlovely meed.<br>
But yet, perchance, so be it he live to-day,<br>
We, with Heaven’s succour, may restore his peace.’—<br>
Thus far the prophet, when immediately<br>
Teucer dispatched me, ere the assembly rose,<br>
Bearing to thee this missive to be kept<br>
With all thy care. But if my speed be lost,<br>
And Calchas’ word have power, the man is dead.</p>

Because he, whom we trusted to have brought<br>
To lend us loyal help with heart and hand,<br>
Proved in the trial a worse than Phrygian foe;<br>
Who lay in wait for all the host by night,<br>
And sallied forth in arms to shed our blood;<br>
That, had not one in Heaven foiled this attempt,<br>
Our lot had been to lie as he doth here<br>
Dead and undone for ever, while he lived<br>
And flourished. Heaven hath turned this turbulence<br>
To fall instead upon the harmless flock.<br>
Wherefore no strength of man shall once avail<br>
To encase his body with a seemly tomb,<br>
But outcast on the wide and watery sand,<br>
He’ll feed the birds that batten on the shore.<br>
Nor let thy towering spirit therefore rise<br>
In threatening wrath. Wilt thou or not, our hand<br>
Shall rule him dead, howe’er he braved us living,<br>
And that by force; for never would he yield,<br>
Even while he lived, to words from me. And yet<br>
It shows base metal when the subject-wight<br>
Deigns not to hearken to the chief in power.<br>
Since without settled awe, neither in states<br>
Can laws have rightful sway, nor can a host<br>
Be governed with due wisdom, if no fear<br>
Or wholesome shame be there to shield its safety.<br>
And though a man wax great in thews and bulk,<br>
Let him be warned: a trifling harm may ruin him.<br>
Whoever knows respect and honour both<br>
Stands free from risk of dark vicissitude.<br>
But whereso pride and licence have their fling,<br>
Be sure that state will one day lose her course<br>
And founder in the abysm. Let fear have place<br>

Of kind remembrance any more for thee,<br>
Aias, who oftentimes for his behoof<br>
Hast jeoparded thy life in labour of war.<br>
Now all is clean forgotten and out of mind.<br>
Thou who hast multiplied words void of sense,<br>
Hast thou no faintest memory of the time<br>
When who but Aias came and rescued you<br>
Already locked within the toils,—all lost,<br>
The rout began: when close abaft the ships<br>
The torches flared, and o’er the bootless trench<br>
Hector was bounding high to board our fleet?<br>
Who stayed that onset? Was not Aias he?<br>
Whom thou deny’st to have once set foot by thine.<br>
Find ye no merit there? And once again<br>
When he met Hector singly, man to man,<br>
Not by your bidding, but the lottery’s choice,<br>
His lot, that skulked not low adown i’ the heap,<br>
A moist earth-clod, but sure to spring in air,<br>
And first to clear the plumy helmet’s brim.<br>
Yes, Aias was the man, and I too there<br>
Kept rank, the ‘barbarous mother’s servile son.’<br>
I pity thee the blindness of that word.<br>
Who was thy father’s father? A barbarian,<br>
Pelops, the Phrygian, if you trace him far!<br>
And what was Atreus, thine own father? One<br>
Who served his brother with the abominable<br>
Dire feast of his own flesh. And thou thyself<br>
Cam’st from a Cretan mother, whom her sire<br>
Caught with a man who had no right in her<br>
And gave dumb fishes the polluted prey.<br>
Such was thy race. What is the race thou spurnest?<br>
My father, Telamon, of all the host<br>
Being foremost proved in valour, took as prize<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 79]</span><span class="linenum">[1301-1337]</span>
My mother for his mate: a princess she,<br>
Born of Laomedon; Alcmena’s son<br>
Gave her to grace him—a triumphant meed.<br>
Thus royally descended and thus brave,<br>
Shall I renounce the brother of my blood,<br>
Or suffer thee to thrust him in his woes<br>
Far from all burial, shameless that thou art?<br>
Be sure that, if ye cast him forth, ye’ll cast<br>
Three bodies more beside him in one spot;<br>
For nobler should I find it here to die<br>
In open quarrel for my kinsman’s weal,<br>
Than for thy wife—or Menelaüs’, was ’t?<br>
Consider then, not my case, but your own.<br>
For if you harm me you will wish some day<br>
To have been a coward rather than dare me.</p>

</ul>
<p class="lftbrk">SCENE. Before the Royal Palace in the Cadmean
citadel of Thebes.</p>
<p class="break"><span class="page2">[page 84]</span>
Laius, the descendant of Cadmus, and king of Thebes
(or Thebè), had been told by an oracle that if a son were
born to him by his wife Jocasta the boy would be his
father’s death.</p>
<p>Under such auspices, Oedipus was born, and to elude the
prophecy was exposed by his parents on Mount Cithaeron.
But he was saved by a compassionate shepherd, and became
the adopted son of Polybus, king of Corinth. When
he grew up he was troubled by a rumour that he was not
his father’s son. He went to consult the oracle of Apollo
at Delphi, and was told—not of his origin but of his destiny—that
he should be guilty of parricide and incest.</p>
<p>He was too horror-stricken to return to Corinth, and as
he travelled the other way, he met Laius going from Thebes
to Delphi. The travellers quarrelled and the son killed his
father, but knew not whom he had slain. He went onward
till he came near Thebes, where the Sphinx was
making havoc of the noblest citizens, devouring all who
failed to solve her riddle. But Oedipus succeeded and
overcame her, and, as Laius did not return, was rewarded
with the regal sceptre,—and with the hand of the queen.</p>
<p>He reigned nobly and prosperously, and lived happily
with Jocasta, by whom he had four children.</p>
<p>But after some years a plague descended on the people,
and Apollo, on being inquired of, answered that it was for
Laius’ death. The act of regicide must be avenged.
Oedipus undertakes the task of discovering the murderer,—and
in the same act discovers his own birth, and the fulfilment
of both the former prophecies.</p>
<p>Jocasta hangs herself, and Oedipus in his despair puts
out his eyes.</p>

<h3>KING OEDIPUS</h3>
<p class="sdn"><span class="cnm">OEDIPUS</span>—<span class="cnm">Priest of Zeus</span><br>
(with the <span class="cnm">Train of Suppliants</span> grouped before an altar).</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OEDIPUS.</span>
Nurslings of Cadmus, children of my care,<br>
Why press ye now to kneel before my gate<br>
With sacred branches in those suppliant hands,<br>
While o’er your city clouds of incense rise<br>
And sounds of praise, mingling with sounds of woe?<br>
<span class="in2">I would not learn of your estate, my sons,</span><br>
Through others, wherefore I myself am come,<br>
Your Oedipus,—a name well known to men.<br>
Speak, aged friend, whose look proclaims thee meet<br>
To be their spokesman—What desire, what fear<br>
Hath brought you? Doubt not of my earnest will<br>
To lend all succour. Hard would be the heart<br>
That looked unmoved on such a kneeling throng.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PRIEST.</span>
Great ruler of my country, thou beholdest<br>
The different ages of our flock who here<br>
Are gathered round thine altar,—some, whose wing<br>
Hath not yet ventured far from home, and some<br>
Burdened with many years, priests of the Gods,<br>
Myself the arch priest of Zeus, and these fresh youths,<br>
A chosen few. Others there are who crowd<br>
The holy agora and the temples twain<br>
Of Pallas, and Ismenus’ hallowed fires,<br>
A suppliant host. For, as thyself perceivest,<br>
Our city is tempest tost, and all too weak<br>
To lift above the waves her weary prow<br>
That plunges in a rude and ravenous sea.<br>
Earth’s buds are nipped, withering the germs within,<br>
Our cattle lose their increase, and our wives<br>
Have fruitless travail; and that scourge from Heaven,<br>
The fiery Pestilence abhorred of men,<br>
Descending on our people with dire stroke<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 86]</span><span class="linenum">[27-65]</span>
Lays waste the Home of Cadmus, while dark Death<br>
Wins ample tribute of laments and groans.<br>
<span class="in2">We kneel, then, at thy hearth; not likening thee</span><br>
Unto the gods, I nor these children here,<br>
But of men counting thee the first in might<br>
Whether to cope with earthly casualty<br>
Or visiting of more than earthly Power.<br>
Thou, in thy coming to this Theban land,<br>
Didst take away the hateful tax we paid<br>
To <a href="#King_n_1" id="King_t_1" class="pginternal">that stern songstress,</a>—aided not by us<br>
With hint nor counsel, but, as all believe,<br>
Gifted from heaven with life-restoring thought.<br>
Now too, great Oedipus of matchless fame,<br>
We all uplift our suppliant looks to thee,<br>
To find some help for us, whether from man,<br>
Or through the prompting of a voice Divine.<br>
Experienced counsel, we have seen and know,<br>
Hath ever prosperous issue. Thou, then, come,<br>
Noblest of mortals, give our city rest<br>
From sorrow! come, take heed! seeing this our land<br>
Now calls thee Saviour for thy former zeal;<br>
And ’twere not well to leave this memory<br>
Of thy great reign among Cadmean men,<br>
‘He raised us up, only again to fall.’<br>
Let the salvation thou hast wrought for us<br>
Be flawless and assured! As once erewhile<br>
Thy lucky star gave us prosperity,<br>
Be the same man to-day. Wouldst thou be king<br>
In power, as in command, ’tis greater far<br>
To rule a people than a wilderness.<br>
Since nought avails or city or buttressed wall<br>
Or gallant vessel, if unmanned and void.</p>

Ye touch me to the core. Full well I know<br>
Your trouble and your desire. Think not, my sons,<br>
I have no feeling of your misery!<br>

Your grief is held within the single breast<br>
Of each man severally. My burdened heart<br>
Mourns for myself, for Thebè, and for you.<br>
Your coming hath not roused me from repose:<br>

I have watched, and bitterly have wept; my mind<br>

And now I have tried in act the only plan<br>
Long meditation showed me. I have sent<br>
The brother of my queen, Menoeceus’ son,<br>
Creon, to learn, in Phoebus’ Delphian Hall,<br>
What word or deed of mine may save this city.<br>
And when I count the time, I am full of pain<br>
To guess his speed; for he is absent long,<br>
Beyond the limit of expectancy.<br>
But when he shall appear, base then were I<br>
In aught to disobey the voice of Heaven.</p>

Lo, in good time, crowning thy gracious word,<br>

At home, afield, or on some foreign soil?</p>

But nevermore returned since he set forth.</p>

No, they were slain; save one, who, flying in fear,<br>
Had nought to tell us but one only thing.</p>

Your prayers are answered. Succour and relief<br>
Are yours, if ye will heed my voice and yield<br>
What help the plague requires. Hear it from me,<br>
Who am hitherto a stranger to the tale,<br>
As to the crime. Being nought concerned therewith,<br>
I could not of myself divine the truth.<br>
But now, as one adopted to your state,<br>
To all of you Cadmeans I speak this:<br>
Whoe’er among you knoweth the murderer<br>
Of Laius, son of royal Labdacus,<br>
Let him declare the deed in full to me.<br>
First, if the man himself be touched with fear,<br>
Let him depart, carrying the guilt away;<br>
No harm shall follow him:—he shall go free.<br>
Or if there be who knows another here,<br>
Come from some other country, to have wrought<br>
This murder, let him speak. Reward from me<br>
And store of kind remembrance shall be his.<br>
But if ye are silent, and one present here<br>
Who might have uttered this, shall hold his peace,<br>
As fearing for himself, or for his friend,<br>
What then shall be performed, hear me proclaim.<br>
I here prohibit all within this realm<br>
Whereof I wield the sceptre and sole sway,<br>
To admit the murderer, whosoe’er he be,<br>
Within their houses, or to speak with him,<br>
Or share with him in vow or sacrifice<br>
Or lustral rite. All men shall thrust him forth,<br>
Our dark pollution, so to me revealed<br>
By this day’s oracle from Pytho’s cell.<br>
<span class="in2">So firm is mine allegiance to the God</span><br>
And your dead sovereign in this holy war.<br>
Now on the man of blood, whether he lurk<br>
In lonely guilt, or with a numerous band,<br>
I here pronounce this curse:—Let his crushed life<br>
Wither forlorn in hopeless misery.<br>
Next, I pray Heaven, should he or they be housed<br>
With mine own knowledge in my home, that I<br>
May suffer all I imprecate on them.<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 92]</span><span class="linenum">[252-287]</span>
Last, I enjoin each here to lend his aid<br>
For my sake, and the God’s, and for your land<br>
Reft of her increase and renounced by Heaven.<br>
It was not right, when your good king had fallen,<br>
Although the oracle were silent still,<br>
To leave this inquisition unperformed.<br>
Long since ye should have purged the crime. But now<br>
I, to whom fortune hath transferred his crown,<br>
And given his queen in marriage,—yea, moreover,<br>
His seed and mine had been one family<br>
Had not misfortune trampled on his head<br>
Cutting him off from fair posterity,—<br>
All this being so, I will maintain his cause<br>
As if my father’s, racking means and might<br>

Of Laius, son to Labdacus, and heir<br>
To Polydorus and to Cadmus old,<br>

<span class="in2">Once more, to all who disobey in this</span><br>
May Heaven deny the produce of the ground<br>

There is your villany in breaking fealty.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CR.</span>
Not so, if thou wouldst reason with thyself<br>
As I do. First consider one thing well:<br>
Who would choose rule accompanied with fear<br>
Before safe slumbers with an equal sway?<br>
’Tis not my nature, no, nor any man’s,<br>
Who follows wholesome thoughts, to love the place<br>
Of domination rather than the power.<br>
Now, without fear, I have my will from thee;<br>
But were I king, I should do much unwillingly.<br>
How then can I desire to be a king,<br>
When masterdom is mine without annoy?<br>
Delusion hath not gone so far with me<br>
As to crave more than honour joined with gain.<br>
Now all men hail me happy, all embrace me;<br>
All who have need of thee, call in my aid;<br>
For thereupon their fortunes wholly turn.<br>
How should I leave this substance for that show?<br>
No man of sense can harbour thoughts of crime.<br>
Such vain ambition hath no charm for me,<br>
Nor could I bear to lend it countenance.<br>
If you would try me, go and ask again<br>
If I brought Phoebus’ answer truly back.<br>
Nay more, should I be found to have devised<br>
Aught in collusion with the seer, destroy me,<br>
Not by one vote, but two, mine own with thine.<br>
But do not on a dim suspicion blame me<br>
Of thy mere will. To darken a good name<br>
Without clear cause is heinous wickedness;<br>
And to cast off a worthy friend I call<br>
No less a folly than to fling away<br>
What most we love, the life within our breast.<br>
The certainty of this will come with time;<br>
For time alone can clear the righteous man.<br>
An hour suffices to make known the villain.</p>

Word came to Laius once, I will not say<br>
From Phoebus’ self, but from his ministers,<br>
The King should be destroyed by his own son,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 105]</span><span class="linenum">[714-746]</span>
If son were born to him from me. What followed?<br>
Laius was slain, by robbers from abroad,<br>
Saith Rumour, in a cross-way! But the child<br>
Lived not three days, ere by my husband’s hand<br>
His feet were locked, and he was cast and left<br>
By messengers on the waste mountain wold.<br>
So Phoebus neither brought upon the boy<br>
His father’s murder, nor on Laius<br>
The thing he greatly feared, death by his son.<br>
Such issue came of prophesying words.<br>
Therefore regard them not. God can himself<br>
With ease bring forth what for his ends he needs.</p>

Thou shalt not lose thy rights in such an hour,<br>
When I am harrowed thus with doubt and fear.<br>
To whom more worthy should I tell my grief?<br>
—My father was Corinthian Polybus,<br>
My mother, Dorian Meropè.—I lived<br>
A prince among that people, till a chance<br>
Encountered me, worth wonder, but, though strange,<br>
Not worth the anxious thought it waked in me.<br>
For at a feasting once over the wine<br>
One deep in liquor called aloud to me,<br>
‘Hail, thou false foundling of a foster-sire!’<br>
That day with pain I held my passion down;<br>
But early on the morrow I came near<br>
And questioned both my parents, who were fierce<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 107]</span><span class="linenum">[784-820]</span>
In anger at the man who broached this word.<br>
For their part I was satisfied, but still<br>
It galled me, for the rumour would not die.<br>
<span class="in2">Eluding then my parents I made way</span><br>
To Delphi, where, as touching my desire,<br>
Phoebus denied me; but brake forth instead<br>
With other oracles of misery<br>
And horrible misfortune, how that I<br>
Must know my mother’s shame, and cause to appear<br>
A birth intolerable in human view,<br>
And do to death the author of my life.<br>
I fled forth at the word, conjecturing now<br>
Corinthia’s region by the stars of heaven,<br>
And wandered, where I never might behold<br>
Those dreadful prophecies fulfilled on me.<br>
So travelling on, I came even to the place<br>
Where, as thou tell’st, the King of Thebè fell.<br>
And, O my wife, I will hide nought from thee.<br>
When I drew near the cross-road of your tale,<br>
A herald, and a man upon a car,<br>
Like your description, there encountered me.<br>
And he who led the car, and he himself<br>
The greybeard, sought to thrust me from the path.<br>
Then in mine angry mood I sharply struck<br>
The driver-man who turned me from the way;<br>
Which when the elder saw, he watched for me<br>
As I passed by, and from the chariot-seat<br>
Smote full upon my head with the fork’d goad;<br>
But got more than he gave; for, by a blow<br>
From this right hand, smit with my staff, he fell<br>
Instantly rolled out of the car supine.<br>
I slew them every one. Now if that stranger<br>
Had aught in common with king Laius,<br>
What wretch on earth was e’er so lost as I?<br>
Whom have the Heavens so followed with their hate?<br>
No house of Theban or of foreigner<br>
Must any more receive me, none henceforth<br>
Must speak to me, but drive me from the door!<br>
I, I have laid this curse on mine own head!<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 108]</span><span class="linenum">[821-858]</span>
Yea, and this arm that slew him now enfolds<br>
His queen. O cruel stain! Am I not vile?<br>
Polluted utterly! Yes, I must flee,<br>
And, lost to Thebè, nevermore behold<br>
My home, nor tread my country, lest I meet<br>
In marriage mine own mother, and bring low<br>
His head that gave me life and reared my youth,<br>
My father, Polybus. Ah! right were he<br>
Who should declare some god of cruel mood<br>
Had sent this trouble upon my soul! Ye Powers,<br>
Worshipped in holiness, ne’er may I see<br>
That day, but perish from the sight of men,<br>
Ere sins like these be branded on my name!</p>

He ne’er can show the murder of the king<br>
Rightly accordant with the oracle.<br>
For Phoebus said expressly he should fall<br>
Through him whom I brought forth. But that poor babe<br>
Ne’er slew his sire, but perished long before.<br>

O ye who in this land have ever held<br>
Chief honour, what an object of dire woe<br>
Awaits your eyes, your ears! What piercing grief<br>
Your hearts must suffer, if as kinsmen should<br>
Ye still regard the house of Laius!<br>
Not Phasis, nor the Danube’s rolling flood,<br>
Can ever wash away the stain and purge<br>
This mansion of the horror that it hides.<br>
—And more it soon shall give to light, not now<br>
Unconsciously enacted. Of all ill,<br>
Self-chosen sorrows are the worst to bear.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MESS.</span>
Her own determination. You are spared<br>
The worst affliction, not being there to see.<br>
Yet to the height of my poor memory’s power<br>
The wretched lady’s passion you shall hear.<br>
When she had passed in her hot mood within<br>
The vestibule, straight to the bridal room<br>
She rushes, tearing with both hands her hair.<br>
Then having entered, shutting fast the door,<br>
She called aloud on Laius, long dead,<br>
With anguished memory of that birth of old<br>
Whereby the father fell, leaving his queen<br>
To breed a dreadful brood for his own son.<br>
And loudly o’er the bed she wailed, where she,<br>
In twofold wedlock, hapless, had brought forth<br>
Husband from husband, children from a child.<br>
We could not know the moment of her death,<br>
Which followed soon, for Oedipus with cries<br>
Broke in, and would not let us see her end,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 121]</span><span class="linenum">[1254-1290]</span>
But held our eyes as he careered the hall,<br>
Demanding arms, and where to find his wife,—<br>
No, not his wife, but fatal mother-croft,<br>
Cropped doubly with himself and his own seed.<br>
And in his rage some god directed him<br>
To find her:—’twas no man of us at hand.<br>
Then with a fearful shout, as following<br>
His leader, he assailed the folding-doors;<br>
And battering inward from the mortised bolts<br>
The bending boards, he burst into the room:<br>
Where high suspended we beheld the queen,<br>
In twisted cordage resolutely swung.<br>
He all at once on seeing her, wretched king!<br>
Undid the pendent noose, and on the ground<br>
Lay the ill-starred queen. Oh, then ’twas terrible<br>
To see what followed—for he tore away<br>
The tiring-pins wherewith she was arrayed,<br>
And, lifting, smote his eyeballs to the root,<br>
Saying, Nevermore should they behold the evil<br>
His life inherited from that past time,<br>
But all in dark henceforth should look upon<br>
Features far better not beheld, and fail<br>
To recognize the souls he had longed to know.<br>
Thus crying aloud, not once but oftentimes<br>
He drave the points into his eyes; and soon<br>
The bleeding pupils moistened all his beard,<br>
Nor stinted the dark flood, but all at once<br>
The ruddy hail poured down in plenteous shower.<br>
Thus from two springs, from man and wife together,<br>
Rose the joint evil that is now o’erflowing.<br>
And the old happiness in that past day<br>
Was truly happy, but the present hour<br>
Hath pain, crime, ruin:—whatsoe’er of ill<br>
Mankind have named, not one is absent here.</p>

Agamemnon on his return from Troy, had been murdered
by his wife Clytemnestra and her paramour Aegisthus,
who had usurped the Mycenean throne. Orestes, then a
child, had been rescued by his sister Electra, and sent into
Phocis with the one servant who remained faithful to his
old master. The son of Agamemnon now returns, being of
a full age, accompanied by this same attendant and his
friend Pylades, with whom he has already concerted a plan
for taking vengeance on his father’s murderers, in obedience
to the command of Apollo.</p>
<p>Orestes had been received in Phocis by Strophius, his
father’s friend. Another Phocian prince, named Phanoteus,
was a friend of Aegisthus.</p>

When I behold Aegisthus on the throne<br>
That was my father’s; when I see him wear<br>
Such robes, and pour libations by the hearth<br>
Where he destroyed him; lastly, when I see<br>
Their crowning insolence,—our regicide<br>

She harbours with blood-guiltiness, and fears<br>
No vengeance, but, as laughing at the wrong,<br>

She killed our sire, and orders dance and mirth<br>
That day o’ the month, and joyful sacrifice<br>

Beholding, weep and pine, and mourn that feast<br>
Of infamy, called by my father’s name,<br>

‘Hilding! are you alone in grief? Are none<br>
Mourning for loss of fathers but yourself?<br>
‘Fore the blest Gods! ill may you thrive, and ne’er<br>
Find cure of sorrow from the powers below!’<br>
So she insults: unless she hear one say<br>
‘Orestes will arrive’: then standing close,<br>
She shouts like one possessed into mine ear,<br>
‘These are your doings, this your work, I trow.<br>
You stole Orestes from my gripe, and placed<br>
His life with fosterers; but you shall pay<br>
Full penalty.’ So harsh is her exclaim.<br>
And he at hand, the husband she extols,<br>
Hounds on the cry, that prince of cowardice,<br>
From head to foot one mass of pestilent harm.<br>
Tongue-doughty champion of this women’s-war.<br>
I, for Orestes ever languishing<br>
To end this, am undone. For evermore<br>
Intending, still delaying, he wears out<br>
All hope, both here and yonder. How, then, friends,<br>
Can I be moderate, or feel the touch<br>
Of holy resignation? Evil fruit<br>
Cannot but follow on a life of ill.</p>

Again you are let loose and range at will.<br>
Ay, for Aegisthus is not here, who barred<br>
Your rashness from defaming your own kin<br>
Beyond the gates. But now he’s gone from home,<br>
You heed not me: though you have noised abroad<br>
That I am bold in crime, and domineer<br>
Outrageously, oppressing thee and thine.<br>
I am no oppressor, but I speak thee ill,<br>
For thou art ever speaking ill of me—<br>
Still holding forth thy father’s death, that I<br>
Have done it. So I did: I know it well:<br>
That I deny not; for not I alone<br>
But Justice slew him; and if you had sense,<br>
To side with Justice ought to be your part.<br>
For who but he of all the Greeks, your sire,<br>
For whom you whine and cry, who else but he<br>
Took heart to sacrifice unto the Gods<br>
Thy sister?—having less of pain, I trow,<br>
In getting her, than I, that bore her, knew!<br>
Come, let me question thee! On whose behalf<br>
Slew he my child? Was ’t for the Argive host?<br>
What right had they to traffic in my flesh?—<br>
Menelaüs was his brother. Wilt thou say<br>
He slew my daughter for his brother’s sake?<br>
How then should he escape me? Had not he,<br>
Menelaüs, children twain, begotten of her<br>
Whom to reclaim that army sailed to Troy?<br>
Was Death then so enamoured of my seed,<br>
That he must feast thereon and let theirs live?<br>
Or was the God-abandoned father’s heart<br>
Tender toward them and cruel to my child?<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 146]</span><span class="linenum">[546-581]</span>
Doth this not argue an insensate sire?<br>
I think so, though your wisdom may demur.<br>
And could my lost one speak, she would confirm it.<br>
For my part, I can dwell on what I have done<br>
Without regret. You, if you think me wrong,<br>
Bring reasons forth and blame me to my face!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">EL.</span>
Thou canst not say this time that I began<br>
And brought this on me by some taunting word.<br>
But, so you’d suffer me, I would declare<br>
The right both for my sister and my sire.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CLY.</span>
Thou hast my sufferance. Nor would hearing vex,<br>
If ever thus you tuned your speech to me.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">EL.</span>
Then I will speak. You say you slew him. Where<br>
Could there be found confession more depraved,<br>
Even though the cause were righteous? But I’ll prove<br>
No rightful vengeance drew thee to the deed,<br>
But the vile bands of him you dwell with now.<br>
Or ask the huntress Artemis, what sin<br>
She punished, when she tied up all the winds<br>
Round Aulis.—I will tell thee, for her voice<br>
Thou ne’er may’st hear! ’Tis rumoured that my sire,<br>
Sporting within the goddess’ holy ground,<br>
His foot disturbed a dappled hart, whose death<br>
Drew from his lips some rash and boastful word.<br>
Wherefore Latona’s daughter in fell wrath<br>
Stayed the army, that in quittance for the deer<br>
My sire should slay at the altar his own child.<br>
So came her sacrifice. The Achaean fleet<br>
Had else no hope of being launched to Troy<br>
Nor to their homes. Wherefore, with much constraint<br>
And painful urging of his backward will,<br>
Hardly he yielded;—not for his brother’s sake.<br>
But grant thy speech were sooth, and all were done<br>
In aid of Menelaüs; for this cause<br>
Hadst thou the right to slay him? What high law<br>
Ordaining? Look to it, in establishing<br>
Such precedent thou dost not lay in store<br>
Repentance for thyself. For if by right<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 147]</span><span class="linenum">[581-620]</span>
One die for one, thou first wilt be destroyed<br>
If Justice find thee.—But again observe<br>
The hollowness of thy pretended plea.<br>
Tell me, I pray, what cause thou dost uphold<br>
In doing now the basest deed of all,<br>
Chambered with the blood-guilty, with whose aid<br>
Thou slewest our father in that day. For him<br>
You now bear children—ousting from their right<br>
The stainless offspring of a holy sire.<br>
How should this plead for pardon? Wilt thou say<br>
Thus thou dost ’venge thy daughter’s injury?<br>
O shameful plea? Where is the thought of honour,<br>
If foes are married for a daughter’s sake?—<br>
Enough. No words can move thee. Thy rash tongue<br>
With checkless clamour cries that we revile<br>
Our mother. Nay, no mother, but the chief<br>
Of tyrants to us! For my life is full<br>
Of weariness and misery from thee<br>
And from thy paramour. While he abroad,<br>
Orestes, our one brother, who escaped<br>
Hardly from thy attempt, unhappy boy!<br>
Wears out his life, victim of cross mischance.<br>
Oft hast thou taunted me with fostering him<br>
To be thy punisher. And this, be sure,<br>
Had I but strength, I had done. Now for this word,<br>
Proclaim me what thou wilt,—evil in soul,<br>
Or loud in cursing, or devoid of shame:<br>
For if I am infected with such guilt,<br>
Methinks my nature is not fallen from thine.</p>

List, then, as I shall speak: and grant the dreams<br>

If hostile, turn their influence on my foes.<br>

Thrust me from this high fortune, but vouchsafe<br>

For that I am here, and I will tell the whole.<br>
He, entering on the great arena famed<br>
As Hellas’ pride, to win a Delphian prize,<br>
On hearing the loud summons of the man<br>
Calling the foot-race, which hath trial first,<br>
Came forward, a bright form, admired by all.<br>
And when his prowess in the course fulfilled<br>
The promise of his form, he issued forth<br>
Dowered with the splendid meed of victory.—<br>
To tell a few out of the many feats<br>
Of such a hero were beyond my power.<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 150]</span><span class="linenum">[690-727]</span>
Know then, in brief, that of the prizes set<br>
For every customary course proclaimed<br>
By order of the judges, the whole sum<br>
Victoriously he gathered, happy deemed<br>
By all; declared an Argive, and his name<br>
Orestes, son of him who levied once<br>
The mighty armament of Greeks for Troy.<br>
So fared he then: but when a God inclines<br>
To hinder happiness, not even the strong<br>
Are scatheless. So, another day, when came<br>
At sunrise the swift race of charioteers,<br>
He entered there with many a rival car:—<br>
One from Achaia, one from Sparta, two<br>
Libyan commanders of the chariot-yoke;<br>
And he among them fifth, with steeds of price<br>
From Thessaly;—the sixth Aetolia sent<br>
With chestnut mares; the seventh a Magnete man;<br>
The eighth with milk-white colts from Oeta’s vale;<br>
The ninth from god-built Athens; and the tenth<br>
Boeotia gave to make the number full.<br>
Then stood they where the judges of the course<br>
Had posted them by lot, each with his team;<br>
And sprang forth at the brazen trumpet’s blare.<br>
Shouting together to their steeds, they shook<br>
The reins, and all the course was filled with noise<br>
Of rattling chariots, and the dust arose<br>
To heaven. Now all in a confusèd throng<br>
Spared not the goad, each eager to outgo<br>
The crowded axles and the snorting steeds;<br>
For close about his nimbly circling wheels<br>
And stooping sides fell flakes of panted foam.<br>
Orestes, ever nearest at the turn,<br>
With whirling axle seemed to graze the stone,<br>
And loosing with free rein the right-hand steed<br>
<a href="#Elec_n_5" id="Elec_t_5" class="pginternal">That pulled the side-rope,</a> held the near one in.<br>
<span class="in2">So for a time all chariots upright moved,</span><br>
But soon the Oetaean’s hard-mouthed horses broke<br>
From all control, and wheeling as they passed<br>
From the sixth circuit to begin the seventh,<br>
Smote front to front against the Barcan car.<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 151]</span><span class="linenum">[728-766]</span>
And when that one disaster had befallen,<br>
Each dashed against his neighbour and was thrown,<br>
Till the whole plain was strewn with chariot-wreck.<br>
Then the Athenian, skilled to ply the rein,<br>
Drew on one side, and heaving to, let pass<br>
The rider-crested surge that rolled i’ the midst.<br>
Meanwhile Orestes, trusting to the end,<br>
Was driving hindmost with tight rein; but now,<br>
Seeing him left the sole competitor,<br>
Hurling fierce clamour through his steeds, pursued:<br>
So drave they yoke by yoke—now this, now that<br>
Pulling ahead with car and team. Orestes,<br>
Ill-fated one, each previous course had driven<br>
Safely without a check, but after this,<br>
<a href="#Elec_n_6" id="Elec_t_6" class="pginternal">In letting loose again the left-hand rein,</a><br>
He struck the edge of the stone before he knew,<br>
Shattering the axle’s end, and tumbled prone,<br>
<a href="#Elec_n_7" id="Elec_t_7" class="pginternal">Caught in the reins,</a> that dragged him with sharp thongs.<br>
Then as he fell to the earth the horses swerved,<br>
And roamed the field. The people when they saw<br>
Him fallen from out the car, lamented loud<br>
For the fair youth, who had achieved before them<br>
Such glorious feats, and now had found such woe,—<br>
Dashed on the ground, then tossed with legs aloft<br>
Against the sky,—until the charioteers,<br>
Hardly restraining the impetuous team,<br>
Released him, covered so with blood that none,—<br>
No friend who saw—had known his hapless form.<br>
Which then we duly burned upon the pyre.<br>
And straightway men appointed to the task<br>
From all the Phocians bear his mighty frame—<br>
Poor ashes! narrowed in a brazen urn,—<br>
That he may find in his own fatherland<br>
His share of sepulture.—Such our report,<br>
Painful to hear, but unto us, who saw,<br>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CHR.</span>
Well, I will tell thee all I saw:—I came<br>
Unto the ancient tomb that holds our sire;<br>
And from the topmost mound I marked a stream<br>
Of milk fresh-flowing, and his resting place<br>
Ringed round with garlands of all flowers that blow.<br>
I marvelled at the sight, and peered about,<br>
Lest some one might be nearer than we knew.<br>
But finding all was quiet in the spot,<br>
I ventured closer to the tomb, and there,<br>
Hard by the limit, I beheld a curl<br>
Of hair new shorn, with all the gloss of youth<br>
And straight it struck my heart, as with a sense<br>
Of something seen, ah me! long, long ago,<br>
And told me that my sight encountered here<br>
The token of Orestes, dearest soul<br>
Then, clasping it, I did not cry aloud,<br>
But straight mine eyes were filled with tears of joy.<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 156]</span><span class="linenum">[907-943]</span>
And now as much as then I feel assured<br>
He and none else bestowed this ornament.<br>
To whom beyond thyself and me belongs<br>
Such consecration? And I know this well,<br>
I did it not,—nor thou. Impossible!<br>
Thou canst not worship even the blessèd Gods<br>
Forth of this roof, unpunished. And, most sure,<br>
Our mother is not minded so to act,<br>
Nor, had she done it, could we fail to know.<br>
This offering comes then of Orestes’ hand.<br>
Take courage, dear one. Not one fate pursues<br>
One house perpetually, but changeth still.<br>
Ours was a sullen Genius, but perchance<br>
This day begins the assurance of much good.</p>

Then hearken my resolve. Thou seëst now,<br>
We have no friendly succour in the world;<br>
But death has taken all, and we are left<br>
Two only. I, so long as I could hear<br>
My brother lived and flourished, still had hope<br>
He would arise to wreak his father’s blood.<br>
But now that he is gone, to thee I turn,<br>
To help thy sister boldly to destroy<br>
The guilty author of our father’s death,<br>
Aegisthus.—Wherefore hide it from thee now?<br>
—Yea, sister! Till what term wilt thou remain<br>
Inactive? To what end? What hope is yet<br>
Left standing? Surely thou hast cause to grieve,<br>
Bobbed of thy father’s opulent heritage,<br>
And feeling bitterly the creeping years<br>
That find thee still a virgin and unwed.<br>
Nay, nor imagine thou shalt ever know<br>
That blessing. Not so careless of his life<br>
Is King Aegisthus, as to risk the birth<br>
Of sons from us, to his most certain fall.<br>
But if thou wilt but follow my resolve,<br>
First thou shalt win renown of piety<br>
From our dead father, and our brother too,<br>
Who rest beneath the ground, and shalt be free<br>
For evermore in station as in birth,<br>
And nobly matched in marriage, for the good<br>
Draw gazers to them still. Then seest thou not<br>
What meed of honour, if thou dost my will,<br>
Thou shalt apportion to thyself and me?<br>
For who, beholding us, what citizen,<br>
What foreigner, will not extend the hand<br>
Of admiration, and exclaim, ‘See, friends,<br>
These scions of one stock, these noble twain,<br>
These that have saved their father’s house from woe,<br>
Who once when foes were mighty, set their life<br>
Upon a cast, and stood forth to avenge<br>
The stain of blood! Who will not love the pair<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 158]</span><span class="linenum">[981-1018]</span>
And do them reverence? Who will not give<br>
Honour at festivals, and in the throng<br>
Of popular resort, to these in chief,<br>
For their high courage and their bold emprise?’<br>
Such fame will follow us in all the world.<br>
Living or dying, still to be renowned.<br>
Ah, then, comply, dear sister; give thy sire<br>
This toil—this labour to thy brother give;<br>
End these my sufferings, end thine own regret:<br>
The well-born cannot bear to live in shame.</p>

<p class="lftbrk">SCENE. Before the temporary abode of Heracles in Trachis.</p>
<p class="break"><span class="page2">[page 176]</span>
This tragedy is named from the Chorus. From the
subject it might have been called ‘Deanira or the Death
of Heracles’.</p>
<p>The Centaur Nessus, in dying by the arrow of Heracles,
which had been dipped in the venom of the Hydra, persuaded
the bride Deanira, whose beauty was the cause of
his death, to keep some of the blood from the wound as a
love-charm for her husband. Many years afterwards,
when Heracles was returning from his last exploit of sacking
Oechalia, in Euboea, he sent before him, by his herald
Lichas, Iole, the king’s daughter, whom he had espoused.
Deanira, when she had discovered this, commissioned
Lichas when he returned to present his master with a robe,
which she had anointed with the charm,—hoping by this
means to regain her lord’s affection. But the poison of
the Hydra did its work, and Heracles died in agony, Deanira
having already killed herself on ascertaining what she had
done. The action takes place in Trachis, near the Mahae
Gulf, where Heracles and Deanira, by permission of Ceyx,
the king of the country, have been living in exile. At the
close of the drama, Heracles, while yet alive, is carried
towards his pyre on Mount Oeta.</p>

<h3>THE TRACHINIAN MAIDENS</h3>
<p class="dlg"><span class="in2"><span class="cnm">DÊANIRA.</span>
Men say,—’twas old experience gave the word,</span><br>
—‘No lot of mortal, ere he die, can once<br>
Be known for good or evil.’ But I know,<br>
Before I come to the dark dwelling-place,<br>
Mine is a lot, adverse and hard and sore.<br>
Who yet at Pleuron, in my father’s home,<br>
Of all Aetolian women had most cause<br>
To fear my bridal. For a river-god,<br>
Swift Achelôüs, was my suitor there<br>
And sought me from my father in three forms;<br>
Now in his own bull-likeness, now a serpent<br>
Of coiling sheen, and now with manlike build<br>
But bovine front, while from the shadowy beard<br>
Sprang fountain-waters in perpetual spray.<br>
Looking for such a husband, I, poor girl!<br>
Still prayed that Death might find me, ere I knew<br>
That nuptial.—Later, to my glad relief,<br>
Zeus’ and Alcmena’s glorious offspring came,<br>
And closed with him in conflict, and released<br>
My heart from torment. How the fight was won<br>
I could not tell. If any were who saw<br>
Unshaken of dread foreboding, such may speak.<br>
But I sate quailing with an anguished fear,<br>
Lest beauty might procure me nought but pain,<br>
Till He that rules the issue of all strife,<br>
Gave fortunate end—if fortunate! For since,<br>
Assigned by that day’s conquest, I have known<br>
The couch of Heracles, my life is spent<br>
In one continual terror for his fate.<br>
Night brings him, and, ere morning, some fresh toil<br>
Drives him afar. And I have borne him seed;<br>
Which he, like some strange husbandman that farms<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 178]</span>
A distant field, finds but at sowing time<br>
And once in harvest. Such a weary life<br>
Still tossed him to and fro,—no sooner home<br>
But forth again, serving I know not whom.<br>
<span class="in2">And when his glorious head had risen beyond</span><br>
These labours, came the strongest of my fear.<br>
For since he quelled the might of Iphitus,<br>
We here in Trachis dwell, far from our home,<br>
Dependent on a stranger, but where he<br>
Is gone, none knoweth. Only this I know,<br>
His going pierced my heart with pangs for him,<br>
And now I am all but sure he bears some woe.<br>
These fifteen months he hath sent me not one word.<br>
And I have cause for fear. Ere he set forth<br>
He left a scroll with me, whose dark intent<br>
I oft pray Heaven may bring no sorrow down.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATTENDANT.</span>

Why is not one commissioned to explore<br>
For Heracles? and why not Hyllus first,<br>
Whom most it would beseem to show regard<br>

As bound for bright achievement, not for death.<br>
But now, as though his life had end, he told<br>
What marriage-portion I must keep, what shares<br>
He left his sons out of their father’s ground:<br>
And set a time, when fifteen moons were spent,<br>
Counted from his departure, that even then<br>
Or he must die, or if that date were out<br>
And he had run beyond it, he should live<br>
Thenceforth a painless and untroubled life.<br>
Such by Heaven’s fiat was the promised end<br>
Of Heracles’ long labours, as he said;<br>
So once the ancient oak-tree had proclaimed<br>
In high Dodona through the sacred Doves.<br>
Of which prediction on this present hour<br>
In destined order of accomplishment<br>
The veritable issue doth depend.<br>

Why lofty-towered Oechalia and her lord<br>
Fell before Heracles, whom Love alone<br>
Of heavenly powers had warmed to this emprise,<br>
And not the Lydian thraldom or the tasks<br>
Of rigorous Omphalè, nor that wild fate<br>
Of rock-thrown Iphitus. Now he thrusts aside<br>
The Love-god, contradicting his first tale.<br>
<span class="in2">When he that was her sire could not be brought</span><br>

In love unrecognized, he framed erelong<br>
A feud about some trifle, and set forth<br>
In arms against this damsel’s fatherland<br>
(Where Eurytus, the herald said, was king)<br>
And slew the chief her father; yea, and sacked<br>
Their city. Now returning, as you see,<br>
He sends her hither to his halls, no slave,<br>

Lightens down Oeta’s topmost glen, be not<br>

Mankind are never constant to one joy.<br>
Whoso would buffet Love, aspires in vain.<br>
For Love leads even Immortals at his will,<br>
And me. Then how not others, like to me?<br>
’Twere madness, sure, in me to blame my lord<br>

The name of liar is a hateful lot.<br>
And thou canst not be hid. Thy news was heard<br>
By many, who will tell me. If thou fearest,<br>
Thou hast no cause—for doubtfulness is pain,<br>
But to know all, what harm? His loves ere now<br>
Were they not manifold? And none hath borne<br>
Reproach or evil word from me. She shall not,<br>
Though his new passion were as strong as death;<br>
Since most mine eye hath pitied her, because<br>
Her beauty was the ruin of her life,<br>
And all unweeting, she her own bright land,<br>
Poor hapless one! hath ravaged and enslaved.—<br>
Let that be as it must. But for thy part,<br>
Though false to others, be still true to me.</p>

Thy mortal wishes within mortal bound<br>
So meekly, I will freely tell thee all.<br>
It is as he avers. This maiden’s love,<br>
Piercing through Heracles, was the sole cause,<br>
Why her Oechalia, land of plenteous woe,<br>
Was made the conquest of his spear. And he—<br>
For I dare so far clear him—never bade<br>
Concealment or denial. But myself,<br>
Fearing the word might wound thy queenly heart,<br>
Sinned, if thou count such tenderness a sin.<br>
But now that all is known, for both your sakes,<br>
His, and thine own no less, look favouringly<br>
Upon the woman, and confirm the word<br>
Thou here hast spoken in regard to her:—<br>

Dear friends, while yonder herald in the house<br>
Holds converse with the captives ere he go,<br>
I have stol’n forth to you, partly to tell<br>
The craft my hand hath compassed, and in part,<br>
To crave your pity for my wretchedness.<br>
For I have taken to my hearth a maid,—<br>
And yet, methinks, no maiden any more,<br>
Like some fond shipmaster, taking on board<br>
A cargo fraught with treason to my heart.<br>
And now we two are closed in one embrace<br>
Beneath one coverlet. Such generous meed<br>
For faith in guarding home this dreary while<br>
Hath the kind Heracles our trusty spouse,<br>
Sent in return! Yet, oft as he hath caught<br>
This same distemperature, I know not how<br>
To harbour indignation against him.<br>
But who that is a woman could endure<br>
To dwell with her, both married to one man?<br>
One bloom is still advancing, one doth fade.<br>
The budding flower is cropped, the full-blown head<br>
Is left to wither, while love passeth by<br>
Unheeding. Wherefore I am sore afraid<br>
He will be called my husband, but her mate,<br>
For she is younger. Yet no prudent wife<br>
Would take this angerly, as I have said.<br>
But, dear ones, I will tell you of a way,<br>
Whereof I have bethought me, to prevent<br>
This heart-break. I had hidden of long time<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 193]</span><span class="linenum">[555-591]</span>
In a bronze urn the ancient Centaur’s gift,<br>
Which I, when a mere girl, culled from the wound<br>
Of hairy-breasted Nessus in his death.<br>
He o’er Evenus’ rolling depths, for hire,<br>
Ferried wayfarers on his arm, not plying<br>
Or rowing-boat, or canvas-wingèd bark.<br>
Who, when with Heracles, a new-made bride,<br>
I followed by my father’s sending forth,<br>
Shouldering me too, in the mid-stream, annoyed<br>
With wanton touch. And I cried out; and he,<br>
Zeus’ son, turned suddenly, and from his bow<br>
Sent a wing’d shaft, that whizzed into his chest<br>
To the lungs. Then the weird Thing, with dying voice<br>
Spake to me:—‘Child of aged Oeneüs,<br>
Since thou wert my last burden, thou shalt win<br>
Some profit from mine act, if thou wilt do<br>
What now I bid thee. With a careful hand<br>
Collect and bear away the clotted gore<br>
That clogs my wound, e’en where the monster snake<br>
Had dyed the arrow with dark tinct of gall;<br>
And thou shalt have this as a charm of soul<br>
For Heracles, that never through the eye<br>
Shall he receive another love than thine.’<br>
Whereof bethinking me, for since his death<br>
I kept it in a closet locked with care,<br>
I have applied it to this robe, with such<br>
Addition as his living voice ordained.—<br>
The thing is done. No criminal attempts<br>
Could e’er be mine. Far be they from my thought,<br>
As I abhor the woman who conceives them!<br>
But if by any means through gentle spells<br>
And bonds on Heracles’ affection, we<br>

Will strike you with strange wonder when you learn.<br>
For, O my friends, the stuff wherewith I dressed<br>
That robe, a flock of soft and milkwhite wool,<br>
Is shrivelled out of sight, not gnawn by tooth<br>
Of any creature here, but, self-consumed,<br>
Frittered and wasting on the courtyard-stones.<br>
<span class="in2">To let you know the circumstance at full,</span><br>
I will speak on. Of all the Centaur-Thing,<br>
When labouring in his side with the fell point<br>
O’ the shaft, enjoined me, I had nothing lost,<br>
But his vaticination in my heart<br>
Remained indelible, as though engraved<br>
With pen of iron upon brass. ’Twas thus:—<br>
I was to keep this unguent closely hid<br>
In dark recesses, where no heat of fire<br>
Or warming ray might reach it, till with fresh<br>
Anointing I addressed it to an end.<br>
So I had done. And now this was to do,<br>
Within my chamber covertly I spread<br>
The ointment with piece of wool, a tuft<br>
Pulled from a home-bred sheep; and, as ye saw,<br>
I folded up my gift and packed it close<br>
In hollow casket from the glaring sun.<br>
But, entering in, a fact encounters me<br>
Past human wit to fathom with surmise.<br>
For, as it happened, I had tossed aside<br>
The bit of wool I worked with, carelessly,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 197]</span><span class="linenum">[696-733]</span>
Into the open daylight, ’mid the blaze<br>
Of Helios’ beam. And, as it kindled warm,<br>
It fell away to nothing, crumbled small,<br>
Like dust in severing wood by sawyers strewn.<br>
So, on the point of vanishing, it lay.<br>
But, from the place where it had lain, brake forth<br>
A frothy scum in clots of seething foam,<br>
Like the rich draught in purple vintage poured<br>
From Bacchus’ vine upon the thirsty ground.<br>
And I, unhappy, know not toward what thought<br>
To turn me, but I see mine act is dire.<br>
For wherefore should the Centaur, for what end,<br>
Show kindness to the cause for whom he died?<br>
That cannot be. But seeking to destroy<br>
His slayer, he cajoled me. This I learn<br>
Too late, by sad experience, for no good.<br>
And, if I err not now, my hapless fate<br>
Is all alone to be his murderess.<br>
For, well I know, the shaft that made the wound<br>
Gave pain to Cheiron, who was more than man;<br>
And wheresoe’er it falls, it ravageth<br>
All the wild creatures of the world. And now<br>
This gory venom blackly spreading bane<br>
From Nessus’ angry wound, must it not cause<br>
The death of Heracles? I think it must.<br>
<span class="in2">Yet my resolve is firm, if aught harm him,</span><br>
My death shall follow in the self-same hour.<br>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Art thou to hear it? On, then, with my tale!<br>
When after sacking Eurytus’ great city<br>
He marched in triumph with first-fruits of war,—<br>
There is a headland, last of long Euboea,<br>
Surf-beat Cenaeum,—where to his father Zeus<br>
He dedicates high altars and a grove.<br>
There first I saw him, gladdened from desire.<br>
And when he now addressed him to the work<br>
Of various sacrifice, the herald Lichas<br>
Arrived from home, bearing thy fatal gift,<br>
The deadly robe: wherewith invested straight,<br>
As thou hadst given charge, he sacrificed<br>
The firstlings of the spoil, twelve bulls entire,<br>
Each after each. But the full count he brought<br>
Was a clear hundred of all kinds of head.<br>
<span class="in2">Then the all-hapless one commenced his prayer</span><br>
In solemn gladness for the bright array.<br>
But presently, when from the holy things,<br>
And from the richness of the oak-tree core,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 199]</span><span class="linenum">[766-802]</span>
There issued flame mingled with blood, a sweat<br>
Rose on his flesh, and close to every limb<br>
Clung, like stone-drapery from the craftsman’s hand,<br>
The garment, glued unto his side. Then came<br>
The tearing pangs within his bones, and then<br>
The poison feasted like the venomed tooth<br>
Of murderous basilisk.—When this began,<br>
He shouted on poor Lichas, none to blame<br>
For thy sole crime, ‘What guile is here, thou knave?<br>
What was thy fraud in fetching me this robe?’<br>
He, all-unknowing, in an evil hour<br>
Declared his message, that the gift was thine.<br>
Whereat the hero, while the shooting spasm<br>
Had fastened on the lungs, seized him by the foot<br>
Where the ankle turns i’ the socket, and, with a thought,<br>
Hurl’d on a surf-vex’d reef that showed i’ the sea:<br>
And rained the grey pulp from the hair, the brain<br>
Being scattered with the blood. Then the great throng<br>
Saddened their festival with piteous wail<br>
For one in death and one in agony.<br>
And none had courage to approach my sire,—<br>
Convulsed upon the ground, then tossed i’ the air<br>
With horrid yells and crying, till the cliffs<br>
Echoed round, the mountain-promontories<br>
Of Locris, and Euboea’s rugged shore.<br>
Wearied at length with flinging on the earth,<br>
And shrieking oft with lamentable cry,<br>
Cursing the fatal marriage with thyself<br>
The all-wretched, and the bond to Oeneus’ house,<br>
That prize that was the poisoner of his peace,<br>
He lifted a wild glance above the smoke<br>
That hung around, and ’midst the crowd of men<br>
Saw me in tears, and looked on me and said,<br>
‘O son, come near; fly not from my distress,<br>
Though thou shouldst be consumèd in my death,<br>
But lift and bear me forth; and, if thou mayest,<br>
Set me where no one of mankind shall see me.<br>
But if thy heart withhold thee, yet convey me<br>
Out of this land as quickly as ye may.<br>
Let me not die where I am now.’ We then,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 200]</span><span class="linenum">[803-833]</span>
Thus urgently commanded, laid him down<br>
Within our bark, and hardly to this shore<br>
Rowed him convulsed and roaring.—Presently,<br>
He will appear, alive or lately dead.<br>
<span class="in2">Such, mother, is the crime thou hast devised</span><br>
And done against our sire, wherefore let Right<br>
And Vengeance punish thee!—May I pray so?<br>
I may: for thou absolv’st me by thy deed,<br>
Thou that hast slain the noblest of the Earth,<br>
Thy spouse, whose like thou ne’er wilt see again.

Ere he returned to meet him,—out of sight<br>
She hid herself, and fell at the altar’s foot,<br>
And loudly cried that she was left forlorn;<br>
And, taking in her touch each household thing<br>
That formerly she used, poor lady, wept<br>
O’er all; and then went ranging through the rooms,<br>
Where, if there caught her eye the well-loved form<br>
Of any of her household, she would gaze<br>
And weep aloud, accusing her own fate<br>
And her abandoned lot, childless henceforth!<br>
When this was ended, suddenly I see her<br>
Fly to the hero’s room of genial rest.<br>
With unsuspected gaze o’ershadowed near,<br>
I watched, and saw her casting on the bed<br>
The finest sheets of all. When that was done,<br>
She leapt upon the couch where they had lain<br>
And sat there in the midst. And the hot flood<br>
Burst from her eyes before she spake:—‘Farewell,<br>
My bridal bed, for never more shalt thou<br>
Give me the comfort I have known thee give.’<br>
Then with tight fingers she undid her robe,<br>
Where the brooch lay before the breast, and bared<br>
All her left arm and side. I, with what speed<br>
Strength ministered, ran forth to tell her son<br>
The act she was preparing. But meanwhile,<br>
Ere we could come again, the fatal blow<br>
Fell, and we saw the wound. And he, her boy,<br>
Seeing, wept aloud. For now the hapless youth<br>
Knew that himself had done this in his wrath,<br>
Told all too late i’ the house, how she had wrought<br>
Most innocently, from the Centaur’s wit.<br>
So now the unhappy one, with passionate words<br>
And cries and wild embracings of the dead,<br>
Groaned forth that he had slain her with false breath<br>
Of evil accusation, and was left<br>
Orphaned of both, his mother and his sire.<br>

Horror hath caught me as I hear this, woe,<br>
Racking our mighty one with mightier pain.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Many hot toils and hard beyond report,<br>
With sturdy thews and sinews I have borne,<br>
But no such labour hath the Thunderer’s wife<br>
Or sour Eurystheus ever given, as this,<br>
Which Oeneus’ daughter of the treacherous eye<br>
Hath fastened on my back, this amply-woven<br>
Net of the Furies, that is breaking me.<br>
For, glued unto my side, it hath devoured<br>
My flesh to the bone, and lodging in the lungs<br>
It drains the vital channels, and hath drunk<br>
The fresh life-blood, and ruins all my frame,<br>
Foiled in the tangle of a viewless bond.<br>
Yet me nor War-host, nor Earth’s giant brood,<br>
Nor Centaur’s monstrous violence could subdue,<br>
Nor Hellas, nor the Stranger, nor all lands<br>
Where I have gone, cleansing the world from harms.<br>
But a soft woman without manhood’s strain<br>
Alone and weaponless hath conquered me.<br>
Son, let me know thee mine true-born, nor rate<br>
Thy mother’s claim beyond thy sire’s, but bring<br>
Thyself from out the chambers to my hand<br>
Her body that hath borne thee, that my heart<br>
May be assured, if lesser than my pain<br>
It will distress thee to behold her limbs<br>
With righteous torment agonized and torn.<br>
Nay, shrink not, son, but pity me, whom all<br>
May pity—me, who, like a tender girl,<br>
Am heard to weep aloud! This none could say<br>
He knew in me of old; for, murmuring not,<br>
I went with evil fortune, silent still.<br>
Now, such a foe hath found the woman in me!<br>
<span class="in2">Ay, but come near; stand by me, and behold</span><br>
What cause I have for crying. Look but here!<br>
Here is the mystery unveiled. O see!<br>
Ye people, gaze on this poor quivering flesh,<br>
Look with compassion on my misery!<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 208]</span><span class="linenum">[1081-1117]</span>
Ah me!<br>
Ah! ah! Again!<br>
Even now the hot convulsion of disease<br>
Shoots through my side, and will not let me rest<br>
From this fierce exercise of wearing woe.<br>
Take me, O King of Night!<br>
O sudden thunderstroke.<br>
Smite me! O sire, transfix me with the dart<br>
Of thy swift lightning! Yet again that fang<br>
Is tearing; it hath blossomed forth anew,<br>
It soars up to the height!</p>

The oxherd’s plague, and Hydra of the lake<br>
Of Lerna, and the twi-form prancing throng<br>
Of Centaurs,—insolent, unsociable,<br>
Lawless, ungovernable:—the tuskèd pest<br>
Of Erymanthine glades; then underground<br>
Pluto’s three-headed cur—a perilous fear,<br>
Born from the monster-worm; and, on the verge<br>
Of Earth, the dragon, guarding fruits of gold.<br>
These toils and others countless I have tried,<br>
And none hath triumphed o’er me. But to-day,<br>
Jointless and riven to tatters, I am wrecked<br>
Thus utterly by imperceptible woe;<br>

Where I am nothingness and cannot move,<br>

My day is darkened, boy! Undone, undone!<br>
I see our plight too plainly. woe is me!<br>
Come, O my son! —thou hast no more a father,—<br>
Call to me all the brethren of thy blood,<br>
And poor Alcmena, wedded all in vain<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 210]</span><span class="linenum">[1149-1185]</span>

With my last breath what prophecies I know.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Thy mother is not here, but by the shore<br>
Of Tiryns hath obtained a dwelling-place;<br>
And of thy sons, some she hath with her there,<br>
And some inhabit Thebè’s citadel.<br>
But we who are with thee, sire, if there be aught<br>
That may by us be done, will hear, and do.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Then hearken thou unto this task, and show<br>
If worthily thou art reputed mine.<br>
Now is time to prove thee. My great father<br>
Forewarned me long ago that I should die<br>
By none who lived and breathed, but from the will<br>
Of one now dwelling in the house of death.<br>
And so this Centaur, as the voice Divine<br>
Then prophesied, in death hath slain me living.<br>
And in agreement with that ancient word<br>
I now interpret newer oracles<br>
Which I wrote down on going within the grove<br>
Of the hill-roving and earth-couching Selli,—<br>
Dictated to me by the mystic tongue<br>
Innumerous, of my Father’s sacred tree;<br>
Declaring that my ever instant toils<br>
Should in the time that new hath being and life<br>
End and release me. And I look’d for joy.<br>
But the true meaning plainly was my death.—<br>
No labour is appointed for the dead.—<br>
Then, since all argues one event, my son,<br>
Once more thou must befriend me, and not wait<br>
For my voice goading thee, but of thyself<br>
Submit and second my resolve, and know<br>
Filial obedience for thy noblest rule.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
I will obey thee, father, though my heart<br>
Sinks heavily in approaching such a theme.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Before aught else, lay thy right hand in mine.</p>

With thine own hand uplifting this my body,<br>
Taking what friends thou wilt, and having lopped<br>
Much wood from the deep-rooted oak and rough<br>
Wild olive, lay me on the gathered pile,<br>
And burn all with the touch of pine-wood flame.<br>
Let not a tear of mourning dim thine eye;<br>
But silent, with dry gaze, if thou art mine,<br>
Perform it. Else my curse awaits thee still<br>
To weigh thee down when I am lost in night.</p>

Alas that thou shouldst challenge me to this,<br>
To be thy murderer, guilty of thy blood!</p>

Not I, in sooth: but healer of my pain,<br>
And sole preserver from a life of woe.</p>

How can it heal to burn thee on the pyre?</p>

If this act frighten thee, perform the rest.</p>

Mine arms shall not refuse to carry thee.</p>

And wilt thou gather the appointed wood?</p>

So my hand fire it not. In all but this,<br>
Not scanting labour, I will do my part.</p>

Enough. ’Tis well. And having thus much given<br>
Add one small kindness to a list so full.</p>

How great soe’er it were, it should be done.</p>

Think of thine oath to me, and, on my word,<br>
Make her thy wife: nor let another man<br>
Take her, but only thou; since she hath lain<br>
So near this heart. Obey me, O my boy!<br>
And be thyself the maker of this bond.<br>
To spurn at trifles after great things given,<br>

Oh, anger is not right, when men are ill!<br>
But who could bear to see thee in this mind?</p>

Who, not possessed with furies, could choose this?<br>
Far better, father, for me too to die,<br>
Than to live still with my worst enemy.</p>

This youth withdraws his reverence in my death.<br>
But, if thou yield’st not to thy father’s best,<br>
The curse from Heaven shall dog thy footsteps still.</p>

Yea, for thou wak’st the torment that had slept.</p>

Ay me! how cross and doubtful is my way!</p>

Because you will reject your father’s word.</p>

<p class="lftbrk">SCENE. A desert shore of the Island of Lemnos.</p>
<p class="break"><span class="page2">[page 216]</span>
It was fated that Troy should be taken by Neoptolemus,
the son of Achilles, assisted by the bow of Heracles in the
hands of Philoctetes.</p>
<p>Now Philoctetes had been rejected by the army because of
a trouble in his foot, which made his presence with them
insufferable; and had been cast away by Odysseus on the
island of Lemnos.</p>
<p>But when the decree of fate was revealed by prophecy,
Odysseus undertook to bring Philoctetes back, and took
with him Neoptolemus, whose ambition could only be
gratified through the return of Philoctetes with the bow.</p>
<p>Philoctetes was resolutely set against returning, and at
the opening of the drama Neoptolemus is persuaded by
Odysseus to take him with guile.</p>
<p>But when Philoctetes appears, the youth’s ingenuous
nature is so wrought upon through pity and remorse, that
his sympathy and native truthfulness at length overcome
his ambition.</p>
<p>When the inward sacrifice is complete, Heracles appears
from heaven, and by a few words changes the mind of
Philoctetes, so that all ends well.</p>

And here, O noble son of noblest sire,<br>

Ordered by those who had command,—cast forth<br>
Trachinian Philoctetes, Poeas’ son,<br>
His foot dark-dripping with a rankling wound;<br>
When with wild cries, that frighted holy rest,<br>
Filling the camp, he troubled every rite,<br>
That none might handle sacrifice, or pour<br>
Wine-offering, but his noise disturbed our peace.<br>
<span class="in2">But why these words? No moment this for talk,</span><br>

Now most behoves thy service, to explore<br>

Whose twofold aperture, on wintry days,<br>
Gives choice of sunshine, and in summer noons<br>

Then, something lower down, upon the left,<br>

Since, if his bow shall not be ta’en, thy life<br>
Will ne’er be crowned through Troy’s discomfiture.<br>
<span class="in2">Now let me show, why thine approach to him</span><br>
Is safe and trustful as mine cannot be<br>
Thou didst sail forth, not to redeem thine oath,<br>
Nor by constraint, nor with the foremost band.<br>
All which reproaches I must bear: and he,<br>
But seeing me, while master of his bow,<br>
Will slay me, and my ruin will be thine.<br>
This point then craves our cunning, to acquire<br>
By subtle means the irresistible bow—<br>
Thy nature was not framed, I know it well,<br>
For speaking falsehood, or contriving harm.<br>
Yet, since the prize of victory is so dear,<br>
Endure it—We’ll be just another day<br>
But now, for one brief hour, devote thyself<br>
To serve me without shame, and then for aye<br>
Hereafter be the pearl of righteousness.</p>

Not by deceit. For, sure, with his one foot,<br>
He cannot be a match for all our crew<br>

When of my piteous state no faintest sound<br>
Hath reached my home, or any Grecian land!<br>
But they, who pitilessly cast me forth,<br>
Keep silence and are glad, while this my plague<br>
Blooms ever, and is strengthened more and more.<br>
Boy, great Achilles’ offspring, in this form<br>
Thou seest the man, of whom, methinks, erewhile<br>
Thou hast been told, to whom the Hercúlean bow<br>
Descended, Philoctetes, Poeas’ son;<br>
Whom the two generals and the Ithacan king<br>
Cast out thus shamefully forlorn, afflicted<br>
With the fierce malady and desperate wound<br>
Made by the cruel basilisk’s murderous tooth.<br>
With this for company they left me, child!<br>
Exposed upon this shore, deserted, lone.<br>
<span class="in2">From seaward Chrysa came they with their fleet</span><br>
And touched at Lemnos. I had fallen to rest<br>
From the long tossing, in a shadowy cave<br>
On yonder cliff by the shore. Gladly they saw,<br>
And left me, having set forth for my need,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 225]</span><span class="linenum">[273-314]</span>
Poor man, some scanty rags, and a thin store<br>
Of provender. Such food be theirs, I pray!<br>
Imagine, O my son, when they were gone,<br>
What wakening, what arising, then was mine;<br>
What weeping, what lamenting of my woe!<br>
When I beheld the ships, wherewith I sailed,<br>
Gone, one and all! and no man in the place,<br>
None to bestead me, none to comfort me<br>
In my sore sickness. And where’er I looked,<br>
Nought but distress was present with me still.<br>
No lack of that, for one thing!—Ah! my son,<br>
Time passed, and there I found myself alone<br>
Within my narrow lodging, forced to serve<br>
Each pressing need. For body’s sustenance<br>
This bow supplied me with sufficient store,<br>
Wounding the feathered doves, and when the shaft,<br>
From the tight string, had struck, myself, ay me!<br>
Dragging this foot, would crawl to my swift prey.<br>
Then water must be fetched, and in sharp frost<br>
Wood must be found and broken,—all by me.<br>
Nor would fire come unbidden, but with flint<br>
From flints striking dim sparks, I hammered forth<br>
The struggling flame that keeps the life in me.<br>
For houseroom with the single help of fire<br>
Gives all I need, save healing for my sore.<br>
<span class="in2">Now learn, my son, the nature of this isle.</span><br>
No mariner puts in here willingly.<br>
For it hath neither moorage, nor sea-port,<br>
For traffic or kind shelter or good cheer.<br>
Not hitherward do prudent men make voyage.<br>
Perchance one may have touched against his will.<br>
Many strange things may happen in long time.<br>
These, when they come, in words have pitied me,<br>
And given me food, or raiment, in compassion.<br>
But none is willing, when I speak thereof,<br>
To take me safely home. Wherefore I pine<br>
Now this tenth year, in famine and distress,<br>
Feeding the hunger of my ravenous plague.<br>

There came to fetch me, in a gallant ship,<br>
Odysseus and <a href="#Phil_n_2" id="Phil_t_2" class="pginternal">the fosterer of my sire,</a><br>
Saying, whether soothly, or in idle show,<br>
That, since my father perished, it was known<br>
None else but I should take Troy’s citadel.<br>
Such words from them, my friend, thou may’st believe,<br>
Held me not long from making voyage with speed,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 227]</span><span class="linenum">[350-385]</span>
Chiefly through longing for my father’s corse,<br>
To see him yet unburied,—<a href="#Phil_n_3" id="Phil_t_3" class="pginternal">for I ne’er<br>
Had seen him.</a> Then, besides, ’twas a fair cause,<br>
If, by my going, I should vanquish Troy.<br>
One day I had sailed, and on the second came<br>
To sad Sigeum with wind-favoured speed,<br>
When straightway all the host, surrounding me<br>
As I set foot on shore, saluted me,<br>
And swore the dead Achilles was in life,<br>
Their eyes being witness, when they looked on me.<br>
He lay there in his shroud: but I, unhappy,<br>
Soon ending lamentation for the dead,<br>
Went near to those Atridae, as to friends,<br>
To obtain my father’s armour and all else<br>
That had been his. And then,—alas the while,<br>
That men should be so hard!—they spake this word:<br>
‘Seed of Achilles, thou may’st freely take<br>
All else thy father owned, but for those arms,<br>
Another wields them now, Laërtes’ son.’<br>
Tears rushed into mine eyes, and in hot wrath<br>
I straightway rose, and bitterly outspake:<br>
‘O miscreant! What? And have ye dared to give<br>
Mine arms to some man else, unknown to me?’<br>
Then said Odysseus, for he chanced to be near,<br>
‘Yea, child, and justly have they given me these.<br>
I saved them and their master in the field.’<br>
Then in fierce anger all at once I launched<br>
All terms of execration at his head,<br>
Bating no word, being maddened by the thought<br>
That I should lose this heirloom,—and to him!<br>
He, at this pass, though not of wrathful mood,<br>
Stung by such utterance, made rejoinder thus:<br>
‘Thou wast not with us here, but wrongfully<br>
Didst bide afar. And, since thou mak’st so bold,<br>
I tell thee, never shalt thou, as thou sayest,<br>
Sail with these arms to Scyros.’—Thus reviled,<br>
With such an evil echo in mine ear,<br>
I voyage homeward, robbed of mine own right<br>
By that <a href="#Phil_n_4" id="Phil_t_4" class="pginternal">vile offset of an evil tree.</a><br>
Yet less I blame him than the men in power.<br>

For every multitude, be it army or state,<br>
Takes tone from those who rule it, and all taint<br>

The fate of a poor dastard, of mean worth,<br>
But ever shrewd and nimble with his tongue.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Whom but Odysseus canst thou mean by this?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
I meant not him. But there was one Thersites,<br>
Who ne’er made conscience to stint speech, where all<br>
Cried ‘Silence!’ Is he living, dost thou know?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
I saw him not, but knew he was alive.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
He must be: for no evil yet was crushed.<br>
The Heavens will ever shield it. ’Tis their sport<br>
To turn back all things rancorous and malign<br>
From going down to the grave, and send instead<br>
The good and true. Oh, how shall we commend<br>
Such dealings, how defend them? When I praise<br>
Things god-like, I find evil in the Gods.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
I, O thou child of a Trachinian sire,<br>
Henceforth will take good care, from far away<br>
To look on Troy and Atreus’ children twain.<br>
Yea, where the trickster lords it o’er the just,<br>
And goodness languishes and rascals rule,<br>
—Such courses I will nevermore endure.<br>
But rock-bound Scyros henceforth shall suffice<br>
To yield me full contentment in my home.<br>
Now, to my vessel! And thou, Poeas’ child,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 230]</span><span class="linenum">[462-499]</span>
Farewell, right heartily farewell! May Heaven<br>
Grant thy desire, and rid thee of thy plague!<br>
Let us be going, that when God shall give<br>
Fair voyage, that moment we may launch away.</p>

Now, by thy father, by thy mother,—nay,<br>
By all thy love e’er cherished in thy home,<br>
Suppliant I beg thee, leave me not thus lone,<br>
Forlorn in all my misery which thou seest,<br>
In all thou hast heard of here surrounding me!<br>
Stow me with other freightage. Full of care,<br>
I know, and burdensome the charge may prove.<br>
Yet venture! Surely to the noble mind<br>
All shame is hateful and all kindness blest.<br>
And shame would be thy meed, didst thou fail here<br>
But, doing this, thou shalt have glorious fame,<br>
When I return alive to Oeta’s vale.<br>
Come, ’tis the labour not of one whole day.<br>
So thou durst take me, fling me where thou wilt<br>
O’ the ship, in hold, prow, stern, or wheresoe’er<br>
I least may trouble those on board with me.<br>
Ah! by great Zeus, the suppliant’s friend, comply,<br>
My son, be softened! See, where I am fall’n<br>
Thus on my knees before thee, though so weak,<br>
Crippled and powerless. Ah! forsake me not<br>
Thus far from human footstep. Take me, take me!<br>
If only to thy home, or to the town<br>
<a href="#Phil_n_5" id="Phil_t_5" class="pginternal">Of old Chalcodon</a> in Euboea.—From thence<br>
I have not far to Oeta, and the ridge<br>
Of Trachis, and Spercheius’ lordly flood.<br>
So thou shalt bless my father with my sight.<br>
And yet long since I fear he may be gone.<br>
For oft I sent him suppliant prayers by men<br>
Who touched this isle, entreating him to fetch<br>
And bear me safely home with his own crew.<br>
But either he is dead, or else, methinks,<br>
It well may be, my messengers made light<br>
Of my concerns, and hastened onward home.<br>

But now in thee I find both messenger<br>
And convoy, thou wilt pity me and save.<br>
For, well thou knowest, danger never sleeps,<br>
And fear of dark reverse is always nigh.<br>

O morning full of brightness! Kindest friend,<br>
Sweet mariners, how can I make you feel,<br>
In act, how dearly from my heart I love you!<br>
Ye have won my soul. Let us be gone, my son,—<br>
First having said farewell to this poor cave,<br>
My homeless dwelling-place, that thou may’st know,<br>
How barely I have lived, how firm my heart!<br>
Methinks another could not have endured<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 232]</span><span class="linenum">[537-572]</span>
The very sight of what I bore. But I<br>
Through strong necessity have conquered pain.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>

A stranger, with a shipmate of thy crew.<br>
When ye have heard them, ye may then go in.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MERCHANTMAN.</span>
Son of Achilles, my companion here,<br>
Who with two more remained to guard thy ship,<br>
Agreed to help me find thee where thou wert,<br>
Since unexpectedly, through fortune’s will,<br>
I meet thee, mooring by the self-same shore.<br>
For like a merchantman, with no great sail,<br>
Making my course from Ilion to my home,<br>
Grape-clustered Peparethos, when I heard<br>
The mariners declare that one and all<br>
Were of thy crew, I would not launch again,<br>
Without a word, till we had told our news.—<br>
Methinks thou knowest nought of thine own case,<br>
What new devices of the Argive chiefs<br>
Surround thee; nor devices only now,<br>
But active deeds, no longer unperformed.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Well, stranger, for the kindness thou hast shown,—<br>
Else were I base,—my heart must thank thee still.<br>
But tell me what thou meanest, that I may learn<br>
What new-laid plot thou bring’st me from the camp.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MER.</span>
Old Phoenix, Acamas and Demophon<br>
Are gone in thy pursuit with ships and men.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MER.</span>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MER.</span>
The thing is not to do, but doing now.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>

From going himself? Had he some cause for fear?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MER.</span>

Whate’er thou speakest,—who is this I see?</p>

This, sir, is Philoctetes the renowned.</p>

Through what dark traffic is the mariner<br>
Betraying me with whispering in thine ear?</p>

I have not caught it, but whate’er he speaks<br>
He must speak openly to us and thee.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MER.</span>
Seed of Achilles, let me not offend<br>
The army by my words! Full many a boon,<br>
Being poor, I reap from them for service done.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
The Atridae are my foes; the man you see<br>
Is my fast friend, because he hates them sore.<br>
Then, if you come in kindness, you must hide<br>
Nothing from him or me of all thou hast heard.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MER.</span>

Then hear me. These two men whom I have named,<br>
Diomedes and Odysseus, are set forth<br>
Engaged on oath to bring this man by force<br>
If reasons fail. The Achaeans every one<br>
Have heard this plainly from Odysseus’ mouth.<br>
He was the louder and more confident.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Say, for what cause, after so long a time,<br>
Can Atreus’ sons have turned their thoughts on him,<br>
Whom long they had cast forth? What passing touch<br>
Of conscience moved them, or what stroke from Heaven,<br>
Whose wrath requites all wicked deeds of men?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MER.</span>
Methinks thou hast not heard what I will now<br>
Unfold to thee. There was a princely seer,<br>
A son of Priam, Helenus by name,<br>
Whom he for whom no word is bad enough,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 234]</span><span class="linenum">[608-645]</span>
Crafty Odysseus, sallying forth alone<br>
One night, had taken, and in bonds displayed<br>
‘Fore all the Achaeans, a right noble prey.<br>
He, ’mid his other prophecies, foretold<br>
No Grecian force should sack Troy’s citadel,<br>
Till with fair reasons they had brought this man<br>
From Lemnos isle, his lonely dwelling-place.<br>
<span class="in2">When thus the prophet spake, Laërtes’ son</span><br>
Straight undertook to fetch this man, and show him<br>
To all the camp:—he hoped, with fair consent:<br>
But else, perforce.—And, if he failed in this,<br>
Whoever would might smite him on the head.<br>
<span class="in2">My tale is told, dear youth. I counsel speed</span><br>
To thee and to the friend for whom thou carest.</p>

<span class="in2">Ay, but he’ll venture anything in word</span><br>

Wilt take him for a dark malignant foe.<br>
Yet, calling Zeus to witness for my soul,<br>
Once more I will speak. Know this, and mark it well:<br>
Thou bear’st this sickness by a heavenly doom,<br>
Through coming near to Chrysa’s sentinel,<br>
The lurking snake, that guards <a href="#Phil_n_7" id="Phil_t_7" class="pginternal">the sky-roofed fold.</a><br>

Shall soothe thee from thy sore, and thou with me<br>
And with this bow shalt take Troy’s citadel.<br>
How do I know this? I will tell thee straight<br>
We have a Trojan captive, Helenus,<br>
Both prince and prophet, who hath clearly told<br>
This must be so, yea, and ere harvest time<br>
This year, great Troy must fall, else if his words<br>
Be falsified, who will may slay the seer.<br>
Now, since thou know’st of this, yield thy consent;<br>

It nurses nought but evils. Yea, at thee<br>
I marvel. Thou should’st ne’er return to Troy,<br>
Nor suffer me to go, when thou remember’st<br>

<h2>OEDIPUS AT COLONOS</h2>
<h3>THE PERSONS</h3>
<ul class="TOC">
<li>OEDIPUS, <i>old and blind.</i></li>
<li>ANTIGONE, <i>his daughter, a young girl.</i></li>
<li>ISMENE, <i>his daughter, a young girl.</i></li>

<p class="break"><span class="page2">[page 260]</span>
Oedipus had remained at Thebes for some time after his
fall. But he was afterwards banished by the command
of Creon, with the consent of his own sons. Their intention
at first was to lay no claim to the throne. But by-and-by
ambition prevailed with Eteocles, the younger-born, and
he persuaded Creon and the citizens to banish his elder
brother. Polynices took refuge at Argos, where he
married the daughter of Adrastus, and levied an army of
auxiliaries to support his pretensions to the throne of
Thebes. Before going into exile Oedipus had cursed his
sons.</p>
<p>Antigone after a while fled forth to join her father and
support him in his wanderings. Ismenè also once brought
him secret intelligence.</p>
<p>Years have now elapsed, and the Delphian oracle proclaims
that if Oedipus dies in a foreign land the enemies of
Thebes shall overcome her.</p>
<p>In ignorance of this fact, Oedipus, now aged as well as
blind, and led by his daughter Antigone, appears before
the grove of the Eumenides, at Colonos, in the neighbourhood
of Athens. He has felt an inward intimation, which
is strengthened by some words of the oracle received by
him long since at Delphi, that his involuntary crimes have
been atoned for, and that the Avenging Deities will now
receive him kindly and make his cause their own.</p>
<p>After some natural hesitation on the part of the village-councillors
of Colonos, Oedipus is received with princely
magnanimity by Theseus, who takes him under the protection
of Athens, and defends him against the machinations
of Creon.</p>
<p>Thus the blessing of the Gods, which Oedipus carried with
him, is secured to Athens, and denied to Thebes. The
craft of Creon and the prayers of Polynices alike prove
unavailing. Then the man of many sorrows, whose
essential nobleness has survived them all, passes away
mysteriously from the sight of men.</p>
<p>The scene is laid at Colonos, a suburb of Athens much
frequented by the upper classes, especially the Knights
(see Thuc. viii. 67); and before the sacred grove of the
Eumenides, or Gentle Goddesses, a euphemistic title for the
Erinyes, or Goddesses of Vengeance.</p>

Their meagre gifts? Little I ask, and less<br>

Have ta’en this burden on them, bide at home<br>

Still tends upon the old man’s wandering,<br>
Oft in the forest ranging up and down<br>
Fasting and barefoot through the burning heat<br>
Or pelting rain, nor thinks, unhappy maid,<br>
Of home or comfort, so her father’s need<br>
Be satisfied. And thou, that camest before,<br>
Eluding the Cadmeans, and didst tell me<br>
What words Apollo had pronounced on me.<br>
And when they banished me, stood’st firm to shield me,<br>
What news, Ismene, bring’st thou to thy sire<br>
To day? What mission sped thee forth? I know<br>

Father, I will not say what I endured<br>
In searching out the place that sheltered thee.<br>
To tell it o’er would but renew the pain.<br>
But of the danger now encompassing<br>
Thine ill starred sons,—of that I came to speak.<br>
At first they strove with Creon and declared<br>
The throne should be left vacant and the town<br>
Freed from pollution,—paying deep regard<br>
In their debate to the dark heritage<br>
Of ruin that o’ershadowed all thy race.<br>
Far different is the strife which holds them now,<br>
Since some great Power, joined to their sinful mind,<br>
Incites them both to seize on sovereign sway.<br>
Eteocles, in pride of younger years,<br>
Robbed elder Polynices of his right,<br>
Dethroned and banished him. To Argos then<br>
Goes exiled Polynices, and obtains<br>
Through intermarriage a strong favouring league,<br>
Whose word is, ‘Either Argos vanquishes<br>
The seed of Cadmus or exalts their fame’<br>
This, father, is no tissue of empty talk,<br>
But dreadful truth, nor can I tell where Heaven<br>
Is to reveal his mercy to thy woe.</p>

May ne’er be quenched, but that the end may come<br>
According to my wish upon them twain<br>
To this contention and arbitrament<br>
Of battle which they now assay and lift<br>
The threatening spear! So neither he who wields<br>
The sceptred power should keep possession still,<br>
Nor should his brother out of banishment<br>
Ever return:—who, when their sire—when I<br>
Was shamefully thrust from my native land,<br>
Checked not my fall nor saved me, but, for them,<br>
I was driven homeless and proclaimed an exile.<br>
Ye will tell me ’twas in reason that the State<br>
Granted this boon to my express desire.<br>
Nay; for in those first hours of agony,<br>
When my heart raged, and it seemed sweetest to me<br>
To die the death, and to be stoned with stones,<br>
No help appeared to yield me that relief.<br>
But after lapse of days, when all my pain<br>
Was softened, and I felt that my hot spirit<br>
Had run to fierce excess of bitterness<br>
In wreaking mine offence—then, then the State<br>
Drove me for ever from the land, and they,<br>
Their father’s sons, who might have saved their father,<br>
Cared not to help him, but betrayed by them,<br>
For lack of one light word, I wandered forth<br>
To homeless banishment and beggary.<br>
But these weak maidens to their nature’s power<br>
Have striven to furnish me with means to live<br>
And dwell securely, girded round with love.<br>
My sons have chosen before their father’s life<br>
A lordly throne and sceptred sovereignty.<br>
But never shall they win me to their aid,<br>

Nor shall the Theban throne for which they strive<br>
Bring them desired content. That well I know,<br>
Comparing with my daughter’s prophecies<br>
Those ancient oracles which Phoebus once<br>
Spake in mine ear. Then let them send to seek me<br>
Creon, or who is strongest in their State.<br>
For if ye, strangers, will but add your might<br>
To the protection of these awful Powers,<br>
The guardians of your soil, to shelter me,<br>

Mighty to save, and ye shall vex my foes.</p>

Dear son of Aegeus, to the Gods alone<br>
Comes never Age nor Death. All else i’ the world<br>

Earth and men’s bodies weaken, fail, and perish.<br>
Faith withers, breach of faith springs up and glows<br>
And neither men nor cities that are friends<br>
Breathe the same spirit with continuing breath.<br>
Love shall be turned to hate, and hate to love<br>
With many hereafter, as with some to-day.<br>
And though, this hour, between great Thebes and thee<br>
No cloud be in the heaven, yet moving Time<br>
Enfolds a countless brood of days to come,<br>
Wherein for a light cause they shall destroy<br>
Your now harmonious league with severing war,<br>
Even where my slumbering form, buried in death,<br>

Aged and miserable, unhoused, unfed,<br>
Singly attended by this girl, whose fall<br>

Evermore caring for thy poor blind head,<br>
Roving in beggary, so young, with no man<br>
To marry her,—a mark for all mischance.<br>
O misery, what deep reproach I have laid<br>
On thee and me and our whole ill-starred race!<br>
But who can hide evil that courts the day?<br>
Thou, therefore, Oedipus, without constraint,<br>

Remove this horror from the sight of men<br>
By coming to the ancestral city and home<br>

Beforetime, when my self-procurèd woes<br>
Were plaguing me, and I would fain have rushed<br>
To instant banishment, thou wouldst not then<br>
Grant this indulgence to my keen desire.<br>

Since by thine act thou hast disgraced both me<br>
And thine own lineage and thy native land,<br>
Who with unlicensed inroad hast assailed<br>
An ancient city, that hath still observed<br>
Justice and equity, and apart from law<br>
Ratifies nothing; and, being here, hast cast<br>
Authority to the winds, and made thine own<br>
Whate’er thou wouldst, bearing it off perforce,—<br>
Deeming of me forsooth as nothing worth,<br>
And of my city as one enslaved to foes<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 289]</span><span class="linenum">[917-955]</span>
Or void of manhood. Not of Thebe’s will<br>
Come such wild courses. It is not her way<br>
To foster men in sin, nor would she praise<br>
Thy doing, if she knew that thou hast robbed<br>
Me and the gods, dragging poor suppliant wights<br>
From their last refuge at thy will—I would not,<br>
Had I perchance set foot within thy land,<br>
Even were my cause most righteous, have presumed,<br>
Without consent of him who bore chief sway,<br>
To seize on any man, but would have known<br>
How men should act who tread on foreign soil.<br>
Thou bring’st disgrace on thine own mother state<br>
All undeservedly, and the lapse of years<br>
Hath left thee aged, but not wise—Again<br>
I bid those maids now to be brought with speed,<br>
Unless thou would’st be made a sojourner<br>
In Athens by compulsion. This I speak<br>
Not with my lips alone, but from my will.</p>

Not as misprising this thy city’s strength<br>
In arms, or wisdom in debate, I dared<br>
This capture, but in simple confidence<br>
Thy citizens would not so envy me<br>
My blood relations, as to harbour them<br>
Against my will,—nor welcome to their hearths<br>
A man incestuous and a parricide,<br>
The proved defiler of his mother’s bed<br>
Such was the mount of Ares that I knew,<br>
Seat of high wisdom, planted in their soil,<br>
That suffers no such lawless runaways<br>
To haunt within the borders of your realm.<br>
Relying on that I laid my hands upon<br>

Thy obloquy most harms, this agèd head<br>

I have borne unwittingly. So Heaven was pleased<br>
To wreak some old offence upon our race.<br>
Since in myself you will find no stain of sin<br>
For which such ruinous error ’gainst myself<br>
And mine own house might be the recompense.<br>
Tell me, I pray thee, if a word from Heaven<br>
Came to my father through the oracle<br>
That he should die by his son’s hand,—what right<br>
Hast thou to fasten that reproach on me,<br>
The child not yet begotten of my sire,<br>
An unborn nothing, unconceived? Or if,<br>
Born as I was to misery, I encountered<br>
And killed my father in an angry fray,<br>
Nought knowing of what I did or whom I slew,<br>
What reason is’t to blame the unwitting deed?<br>
And, oh, thou wretch! art not ashamed to force me<br>
To speak that of my mother, thine own sister,<br>
Which I will speak, for I will not keep silence,<br>
Since thou hast been thus impious with thy tongue.<br>
She was my mother, oh, the bitter word!<br>
Though neither knew it, and having borne me, she<br>
Became the mother of children to her son,<br>
An infamous birth! Yet this I know, thy crime<br>
Of speech against us both is voluntary.<br>
But all involuntary was my deed<br>
In marriage and is this mine utterance now.<br>
No,—that shall not be called a bosom-sin,<br>
Nor shall my name be sullied with the deed,<br>
Thy tongue would brand on me, against my sire.<br>
For answer me one question. If to-day,<br>
Here, now, one struck at thee a murderous stroke,—<br>
At thee, the righteous person,—wouldst thou ask<br>

If such assailant were thy sire, or strike<br>
Forthwith? Methinks, as one who cares to live,<br>
You would strike before you questioned of the right,<br>
Or reasoned of his kindred whom you slew.<br>
Such was the net that snared me: such the woes<br>
Heaven drew me to fulfil. My father’s spirit,<br>
Came he to life, would not gainsay my word.<br>
But thou, to whom, beneath the garb of right,<br>
No matter is too dreadful or too deep<br>
For words, so rail’st on me, in such a presence.<br>
Well thou dost flatter the great name of Theseus,<br>
And Athens in her glory stablished here,<br>
But midst thy fulsome praises thou forgettest<br>
How of all lands that yield the immortal Gods<br>
Just homage of true piety, this land<br>
Is foremost. Yet from hence thou would’st beguile<br>
Me, the aged suppliant. Nay, from hence thou would’st drag<br>
Myself with violence, and hast reft away<br>
My children. Wherefore I conjure these powers,<br>
With solemn invocation and appeal,<br>

Foremost in augury, foremost in war,<br>
First wields his warlike spear. Next, Oeneus’ son,<br>
Aetolian Tydeus; then Etéoclus<br>
Of Argive lineage; fourth, Hippomedon,<br>
Sent by his father Tálaüs, and the fifth<br>

Is Capancus, who brags he will destroy<br>
Thebè with desolating fire. The sixth,<br>
Parthonopaeus, from the Arcadian glen<br>
Comes bravely down, swift Atalanta’s child,<br>
Named from his mother’s lingering maidenhood<br>
Ere she conceived him. And the seventh am I,<br>
Thy son, or if not thine, but the dire birth<br>
Of evil Destiny, yet named thy son,<br>
Who lead this dauntless host from Argolis<br>
Against the Theban land. Now one and all<br>
We pray thee on our knees, conjuring thee<br>
As thou dost love these maids and thine own life,<br>
My father, to forgive me, ere I go<br>
To be revenged upon my brother there<br>
Who drave me forth and robbed me of my throne.<br>
If aught in prophecy deserves belief,<br>
’Tis certain, whom thou favourest, those shall win.<br>
Now by the wells whereof our fathers drank<br>
And by the Gods they worshipped, hear our prayer,<br>
Grant this petition: since alike in woe,<br>
Alike in poverty and banishment,<br>
Partakers of one destiny, thou and I<br>
Cringe to the stranger for a dwelling place.<br>
Whilst he at home, the tyrant, woe is me,<br>
Laughs at us both in soft luxurious pride.<br>
Whose might, so thou wilt favour my design,<br>
I will lightly scatter in one little hour;<br>
And plant thee in thy Theban palace home<br>
Near to myself, hurling the usurper forth.<br>
All this with thy consent I shall achieve,<br>
But without thee, I forfeit life and all.</p>

Ay, were it not the lord of all this land<br>
Theseus, that brought him to me and desired<br>
He might hear words from me,—never again<br>
Had these tones fallen upon his ear. But now<br>
That boon is granted him: he shall obtain,<br>
Ere he depart, such utterance of my tongue,<br>
As ne’er shall give him joy,—ne’er comfort thee,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 301]</span><span class="linenum">[1354-1390]</span>
Villain, who when possessed of the chief power<br>
Which now thy brother holds o’er Theban land,<br>
Didst banish me, thy father, who stand here,<br>
To live in exile, clothed with such attire,<br>
That moves thy tears now that thine own estate<br>
Is fallen into like depth of struggling woe.<br>
But tears are bootless. Howsoe’er I live,<br>
I must endure, and hold thee still my murderer.<br>
’Tis thou hast girt me round with misery,<br>
’Tis thou didst drive me forth, and driven by thee<br>
I beg my bread, a wandering sojourner.<br>
Yea, had these daughters not been born to me<br>
To tend me, I were dead, for all thou hast done.<br>
They have rescued, they have nursed me. They are men,<br>
Not women, in the strength of ministry.<br>
Ye are another’s, not my sons—For this<br>
The eye of Destiny pursues thee still<br>
Eager to light on thee with instant doom<br>
If once that army move toward the town<br>
Of ancient Thebes,—the <i>town</i>, no dearer name,<br>
‘City’ or ‘Country’ shall beseem thy lip<br>
Till ye both fall, stained with fraternal gore<br>
Long since I launched that curse against you twain<br>
Which here again I summon to mine aid,<br>

To a parent, nor account it a light thing<br>
That ye were cruel sons to your blind sire.<br>
These maidens did not so. Wherefore my curse<br>
Prevails against thy prayer for Thebe’s throne,<br>
If ancient Zeus, the eternal lawgiver,<br>

Begone, renounced and fatherless for me,<br>
And take with thee, vilest of villanous men,<br>

In levying war against thy father’s race,<br>
Frustrate be thy return to Argos’ vale:<br>
Die foully by a fratricidal hand<br>

Ay, there is the main marvel. How he moved<br>
From hence, thou knowest, for thou too wert here,<br>
And saw’st that of his friends none guided him,<br>
But he they loved was leader to them all.<br>
Now, when he came to the steep pavement, rooted<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 308]</span><span class="linenum">[1591-1628]</span>
With adamant foundation deep in Earth,<br>
On one of many paths he took his stand<br>
Near the stone basin, where Peirithoüs<br>
And Theseus graved their everlasting league.<br>
There, opposite the mass of Laurian ore,<br>
Turned from the hollow pear-tree and the tomb<br>
Of marble, he sate down, and straight undid<br>
His travel-soiled attire, then called aloud<br>
On both his children, and bade some one fetch<br>
Pure water from a running stream. And they,<br>
Hasting together to the neighbouring hill<br>
Of green Demeter, goddess of the Spring,<br>
Brought back their sire’s commission speedily,<br>
And bathed, and clothed him with the sacred robe.<br>
When he was satisfied, and nothing now<br>
Remained undone of all he bade them do,<br>
The God of darkness thundered, and the maids<br>
Stood horror-stricken on hearing; then together<br>
Fell at their father’s knees and wept and wailed<br>
Loudly and long with beating of the breast.<br>
He, when that sound of sorrow pierced his ear,<br>
Caressed them in his arms and said:—‘My daughters,<br>
From this day forth you have no more a father.<br>
All that was mine is ended, and no longer<br>
Shall ye continue your hard ministry<br>
Of labour for my life.—And yet, though hard,<br>
Not unendurable, since all the toil<br>
Was rendered light through love, which ye can never<br>
Receive on earth so richly, as from him<br>
Bereaved of whom ye now shall live forlorn.’<br>
Such was the talk, mingled with sobs and crying,<br>
As each clung fast to each. But when they came<br>
To an end of weeping and those sounds were stilled,<br>
First all was silent; then a sudden voice<br>
Hurried him onward, making each man’s hair<br>
Bristle on end with force of instant fear.<br>
Now here, now there, not once but oftentimes,<br>
A God called loudly, ‘Oedipus, Oedipus!<br>
Why thus delay our going? This long while<br>
We are stayed for and thou tarriest. Come away!’<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 309]</span><span class="linenum">[1629-1666]</span>
He, when he knew the summons of the God,<br>
Gave word for royal Theseus to go near;<br>
And when he came, said: ‘Friend for ever kind,<br>
Reach thy right hand, I pray thee (that first pledge)<br>
To these my children:—daughters, yours to him!—<br>
And give thy sacred word that thou wilt never<br>
Betray these willingly: but still perform<br>
All that thou mayest with true thought for their good.’<br>
He, with grand calmness like his noble self,<br>
Promised on oath to keep this friendly bond.<br>
And when he had done so, Oedipus forthwith<br>
Stroking his children with his helpless hands<br>
Spake thus:—‘My daughters, you must steel your hearts<br>
To noble firmness, and depart from hence,<br>
Nor ask to see or hear forbidden things.<br>
Go, go at once! Theseus alone must stay<br>
Sole rightful witness of these mysteries.’<br>
Those accents were the last we all might hear.<br>
Then, following the two maids, with checkless tears<br>
And groans we took our way. But by and by,<br>
At distance looking round, we saw,—not him,<br>
Who was not there,—but Theseus all alone<br>
Holding his hand before his eyes, as if<br>
Some apparition unendurable<br>
Had dazed his vision. In a little while,<br>
We marked him making reverence in one prayer<br>
To the Earth, and to the home of Gods on high.<br>
But by what fate He perished, mortal man,<br>
Save Theseus, none can say. No lightning-flash<br>
From heaven, no tempest rising from the deep,<br>
Caused his departure in that hour, but either<br>
Some messenger from heaven, or, from beneath,<br>
The lower part of Earth, where comes no pain,<br>
Opening kindly to receive him in.<br>
Not to be mourned, nor with a tearful end<br>
Of sickness was he taken from the Earth,<br>
But wondrously, beyond recorded fate.<br>
If any deem my words unwise, I care not<br>
In that man’s judgement to be counted wise.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
