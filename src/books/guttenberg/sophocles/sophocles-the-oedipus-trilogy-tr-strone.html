<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>
<p>
To Laius, King of Thebes, an oracle foretold that the child born to him by his
queen Jocasta would slay his father and wed his mother. So when in time a son
was born the infant’s feet were riveted together and he was left to die on
Mount Cithaeron. But a shepherd found the babe and tended him, and delivered
him to another shepherd who took him to his master, the King of Corinth.
Polybus being childless adopted the boy, who grew up believing that he was
indeed the King’s son. Afterwards doubting his parentage he inquired of the
Delphic god and heard himself the word declared before to Laius. Wherefore he
fled from what he deemed his father’s house and in his flight he encountered
and unwillingly slew his father Laius. Arriving at Thebes he answered the
riddle of the Sphinx and the grateful Thebans made their deliverer king. So he
reigned in the room of Laius, and espoused the widowed queen. Children were
born to them and Thebes prospered under his rule, but again a grievous plague
fell upon the city. Again the oracle was consulted and it bade them purge
themselves of blood-guiltiness. Oedipus denounces the crime of which he is
unaware, and undertakes to track out the criminal. Step by step it is brought
home to him that he is the man. The closing scene reveals Jocasta slain by her
own hand and Oedipus blinded by his own act and praying for death or exile.

<h2>OEDIPUS THE KING</h2>
<p class="noindent">
Suppliants of all ages are seated round the altar at the palace doors,<br>
at their head a PRIEST OF ZEUS. To them enter OEDIPUS.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
My children, latest born to Cadmus old,<br>
Why sit ye here as suppliants, in your hands<br>
Branches of olive filleted with wool?<br>
What means this reek of incense everywhere,<br>
And everywhere laments and litanies?<br>
Children, it were not meet that I should learn<br>
From others, and am hither come, myself,<br>
I Oedipus, your world-renowned king.<br>
Ho! aged sire, whose venerable locks<br>
Proclaim thee spokesman of this company,<br>
Explain your mood and purport. Is it dread<br>
Of ill that moves you or a boon ye crave?<br>
My zeal in your behalf ye cannot doubt;<br>
Ruthless indeed were I and obdurate<br>
If such petitioners as you I spurned.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
PRIEST.<br>
Yea, Oedipus, my sovereign lord and king,<br>
Thou seest how both extremes of age besiege<br>
Thy palace altars—fledglings hardly winged,<br>
and greybeards bowed with years; priests, as am I<br>
of Zeus, and these the flower of our youth.<br>
Meanwhile, the common folk, with wreathed boughs<br>
Crowd our two market-places, or before<br>
Both shrines of Pallas congregate, or where<br>
Ismenus gives his oracles by fire.<br>
For, as thou seest thyself, our ship of State,<br>
Sore buffeted, can no more lift her head,<br>
Foundered beneath a weltering surge of blood.<br>
A blight is on our harvest in the ear,<br>
A blight upon the grazing flocks and herds,<br>
A blight on wives in travail; and withal<br>
Armed with his blazing torch the God of Plague<br>
Hath swooped upon our city emptying<br>
The house of Cadmus, and the murky realm<br>
Of Pluto is full fed with groans and tears.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, O King, here at thy hearth we sit,<br>
I and these children; not as deeming thee<br>
A new divinity, but the first of men;<br>
First in the common accidents of life,<br>
And first in visitations of the Gods.<br>
Art thou not he who coming to the town<br>
of Cadmus freed us from the tax we paid<br>
To the fell songstress? Nor hadst thou received<br>
Prompting from us or been by others schooled;<br>
No, by a god inspired (so all men deem,<br>
And testify) didst thou renew our life.<br>
And now, O Oedipus, our peerless king,<br>
All we thy votaries beseech thee, find<br>
Some succor, whether by a voice from heaven<br>
Whispered, or haply known by human wit.<br>
Tried counselors, methinks, are aptest found<a href="#linknote-1" id="linknoteref-1" class="pginternal">1</a><br>
To furnish for the future pregnant rede.<br>
Upraise, O chief of men, upraise our State!<br>
Look to thy laurels! for thy zeal of yore<br>
Our country’s savior thou art justly hailed:<br>
O never may we thus record thy reign:—<br>
“He raised us up only to cast us down.”<br>
Uplift us, build our city on a rock.<br>
Thy happy star ascendant brought us luck,<br>
O let it not decline! If thou wouldst rule<br>
This land, as now thou reignest, better sure<br>
To rule a peopled than a desert realm.<br>
Nor battlements nor galleys aught avail,<br>
If men to man and guards to guard them tail.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Ah! my poor children, known, ah, known too well,<br>
The quest that brings you hither and your need.<br>
Ye sicken all, well wot I, yet my pain,<br>
How great soever yours, outtops it all.<br>
Your sorrow touches each man severally,<br>
Him and none other, but I grieve at once<br>
Both for the general and myself and you.<br>
Therefore ye rouse no sluggard from day-dreams.<br>
Many, my children, are the tears I’ve wept,<br>
And threaded many a maze of weary thought.<br>
Thus pondering one clue of hope I caught,<br>
And tracked it up; I have sent Menoeceus’ son,<br>
Creon, my consort’s brother, to inquire<br>
Of Pythian Phoebus at his Delphic shrine,<br>
How I might save the State by act or word.<br>
And now I reckon up the tale of days<br>
Since he set forth, and marvel how he fares.<br>
’Tis strange, this endless tarrying, passing strange.<br>
But when he comes, then I were base indeed,<br>
If I perform not all the god declares.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
PRIEST.<br>
Thy words are well timed; even as thou speakest<br>
That shouting tells me Creon is at hand.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
O King Apollo! may his joyous looks<br>
Be presage of the joyous news he brings!<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
PRIEST.<br>
As I surmise, ’tis welcome; else his head<br>
Had scarce been crowned with berry-laden bays.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
We soon shall know; he’s now in earshot range.<br>
[Enter CREON]<br>
My royal cousin, say, Menoeceus’ child,<br>
What message hast thou brought us from the god?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Good news, for e’en intolerable ills,<br>
Finding right issue, tend to naught but good.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
How runs the oracle? thus far thy words<br>
Give me no ground for confidence or fear.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
If thou wouldst hear my message publicly,<br>
I’ll tell thee straight, or with thee pass within.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Speak before all; the burden that I bear<br>
Is more for these my subjects than myself.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Let me report then all the god declared.<br>
King Phoebus bids us straitly extirpate<br>
A fell pollution that infests the land,<br>
And no more harbor an inveterate sore.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
What expiation means he? What’s amiss?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Banishment, or the shedding blood for blood.<br>
This stain of blood makes shipwreck of our state.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Whom can he mean, the miscreant thus denounced?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Before thou didst assume the helm of State,<br>
The sovereign of this land was Laius.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
I heard as much, but never saw the man.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
He fell; and now the god’s command is plain:<br>
Punish his takers-off, whoe’er they be.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Where are they? Where in the wide world to find<br>
The far, faint traces of a bygone crime?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
In this land, said the god; “who seeks shall find;<br>
Who sits with folded hands or sleeps is blind.”<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Was he within his palace, or afield,<br>
Or traveling, when Laius met his fate?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Abroad; he started, so he told us, bound<br>
For Delphi, but he never thence returned.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Came there no news, no fellow-traveler<br>
To give some clue that might be followed up?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
But one escape, who flying for dear life,<br>
Could tell of all he saw but one thing sure.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
And what was that? One clue might lead us far,<br>
With but a spark of hope to guide our quest.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Robbers, he told us, not one bandit but<br>
A troop of knaves, attacked and murdered him.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Did any bandit dare so bold a stroke,<br>
Unless indeed he were suborned from Thebes?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
So ’twas surmised, but none was found to avenge<br>
His murder mid the trouble that ensued.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
What trouble can have hindered a full quest,<br>
When royalty had fallen thus miserably?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
The riddling Sphinx compelled us to let slide<br>
The dim past and attend to instant needs.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Well, <i>I</i> will start afresh and once again<br>
Make dark things clear. Right worthy the concern<br>
Of Phoebus, worthy thine too, for the dead;<br>
I also, as is meet, will lend my aid<br>
To avenge this wrong to Thebes and to the god.<br>
Not for some far-off kinsman, but myself,<br>
Shall I expel this poison in the blood;<br>
For whoso slew that king might have a mind<br>
To strike me too with his assassin hand.<br>
Therefore in righting him I serve myself.<br>
Up, children, haste ye, quit these altar stairs,<br>
Take hence your suppliant wands, go summon hither<br>
The Theban commons. With the god’s good help<br>
Success is sure; ’tis ruin if we fail.<br>
[Exeunt OEDIPUS and CREON]<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
PRIEST.<br>
Come, children, let us hence; these gracious words<br>
Forestall the very purpose of our suit.<br>
And may the god who sent this oracle<br>
Save us withal and rid us of this pest.<br>
[Exeunt PRIEST and SUPPLIANTS]<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
(Str. 1)<br>
Sweet-voiced daughter of Zeus from thy gold-paved Pythian shrine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wafted to Thebes divine,<br>
What dost thou bring me? My soul is racked and shivers with fear.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Healer of Delos, hear!)<br>
Hast thou some pain unknown before,<br>
Or with the circling years renewest a penance of yore?<br>
Offspring of golden Hope, thou voice immortal, O tell me.<br>
<br>
(Ant. 1)<br>
First on Athene I call; O Zeus-born goddess, defend!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goddess and sister, befriend,<br>
Artemis, Lady of Thebes, high-throned in the midst of our mart!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of the death-winged dart!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your threefold aid I crave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From death and ruin our city to save.<br>
If in the days of old when we nigh had perished, ye drave<br>
From our land the fiery plague, be near us now and defend us!<br>
<br>
(Str. 2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me, what countless woes are mine!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All our host is in decline;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weaponless my spirit lies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth her gracious fruits denies;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women wail in barren throes;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life on life downstriken goes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swifter than the wind bird’s flight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swifter than the Fire-God’s might,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the westering shores of Night.<br>
<br>
(Ant. 2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wasted thus by death on death<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All our city perisheth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corpses spread infection round;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None to tend or mourn is found.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wailing on the altar stair<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wives and grandams rend the air—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-drawn moans and piercing cries<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blent with prayers and litanies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden child of Zeus, O hear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let thine angel face appear!<br>
<br>
(Str. 3)<br>
And grant that Ares whose hot breath I feel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though without targe or steel<br>
He stalks, whose voice is as the battle shout,<br>
May turn in sudden rout,<br>
To the unharbored Thracian waters sped,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Amphitrite’s bed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what night leaves undone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smit by the morrow’s sun<br>
Perisheth. Father Zeus, whose hand<br>
Doth wield the lightning brand,<br>
Slay him beneath thy levin bold, we pray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slay him, O slay!<br>
<br>
(Ant. 3)<br>
O that thine arrows too, Lycean King,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that taut bow’s gold string,<br>
Might fly abroad, the champions of our rights;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, and the flashing lights<br>
Of Artemis, wherewith the huntress sweeps<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the Lycian steeps.<br>
Thee too I call with golden-snooded hair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose name our land doth bear,<br>
Bacchus to whom thy Maenads Evoe shout;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come with thy bright torch, rout,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blithe god whom we adore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god whom gods abhor.<br>
<br>
[Enter OEDIPUS.]</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Ye pray; ’tis well, but would ye hear my words<br>
And heed them and apply the remedy,<br>
Ye might perchance find comfort and relief.<br>
Mind you, I speak as one who comes a stranger<br>
To this report, no less than to the crime;<br>
For how unaided could I track it far<br>
Without a clue? Which lacking (for too late<br>
Was I enrolled a citizen of Thebes)<br>
This proclamation I address to all:—<br>
Thebans, if any knows the man by whom<br>
Laius, son of Labdacus, was slain,<br>
I summon him to make clean shrift to me.<br>
And if he shrinks, let him reflect that thus<br>
Confessing he shall ’scape the capital charge;<br>
For the worst penalty that shall befall him<br>
Is banishment—unscathed he shall depart.<br>
But if an alien from a foreign land<br>
Be known to any as the murderer,<br>
Let him who knows speak out, and he shall have<br>
Due recompense from me and thanks to boot.<br>
But if ye still keep silence, if through fear<br>
For self or friends ye disregard my hest,<br>
Hear what I then resolve; I lay my ban<br>
On the assassin whosoe’er he be.<br>
Let no man in this land, whereof I hold<br>
The sovereign rule, harbor or speak to him;<br>
Give him no part in prayer or sacrifice<br>
Or lustral rites, but hound him from your homes.<br>
For this is our defilement, so the god<br>
Hath lately shown to me by oracles.<br>
Thus as their champion I maintain the cause<br>
Both of the god and of the murdered King.<br>
And on the murderer this curse I lay<br>
(On him and all the partners in his guilt):—<br>
Wretch, may he pine in utter wretchedness!<br>
And for myself, if with my privity<br>
He gain admittance to my hearth, I pray<br>
The curse I laid on others fall on me.<br>
See that ye give effect to all my hest,<br>
For my sake and the god’s and for our land,<br>
A desert blasted by the wrath of heaven.<br>
For, let alone the god’s express command,<br>
It were a scandal ye should leave unpurged<br>
The murder of a great man and your king,<br>
Nor track it home. And now that I am lord,<br>
Successor to his throne, his bed, his wife,<br>
(And had he not been frustrate in the hope<br>
Of issue, common children of one womb<br>
Had forced a closer bond twixt him and me,<br>
But Fate swooped down upon him), therefore I<br>
His blood-avenger will maintain his cause<br>
As though he were my sire, and leave no stone<br>
Unturned to track the assassin or avenge<br>
The son of Labdacus, of Polydore,<br>
Of Cadmus, and Agenor first of the race.<br>
And for the disobedient thus I pray:<br>
May the gods send them neither timely fruits<br>
Of earth, nor teeming increase of the womb,<br>
But may they waste and pine, as now they waste,<br>
Aye and worse stricken; but to all of you,<br>
My loyal subjects who approve my acts,<br>
May Justice, our ally, and all the gods<br>
Be gracious and attend you evermore.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
The oath thou profferest, sire, I take and swear.<br>
I slew him not myself, nor can I name<br>
The slayer. For the quest, ’twere well, methinks<br>
That Phoebus, who proposed the riddle, himself<br>
Should give the answer—who the murderer was.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Well argued; but no living man can hope<br>
To force the gods to speak against their will.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
May I then say what seems next best to me?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Aye, if there be a third best, tell it too.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
My liege, if any man sees eye to eye<br>
With our lord Phoebus, ’tis our prophet, lord<br>
Teiresias; he of all men best might guide<br>
A searcher of this matter to the light.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Here too my zeal has nothing lagged, for twice<br>
At Creon’s instance have I sent to fetch him,<br>
And long I marvel why he is not here.<br>

CHORUS.<br>
I mind me too of rumors long ago—<br>
Mere gossip.<br>

 I heard,<br>
But none has seen the man who saw him fall.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
Well, if he knows what fear is, he will quail<br>
And flee before the terror of thy curse.<br>

OEDIPUS.<br>
Words scare not him who blenches not at deeds.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
But here is one to arraign him. Lo, at length<br>
They bring the god-inspired seer in whom<br>
Above all other men is truth inborn.<br>
[Enter TEIRESIAS, led by a boy.]<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Teiresias, seer who comprehendest all,<br>
Lore of the wise and hidden mysteries,<br>
High things of heaven and low things of the earth,<br>
Thou knowest, though thy blinded eyes see naught,<br>
What plague infects our city; and we turn<br>
To thee, O seer, our one defense and shield.<br>
The purport of the answer that the God<br>
Returned to us who sought his oracle,<br>
The messengers have doubtless told thee—how<br>
One course alone could rid us of the pest,<br>
To find the murderers of Laius,<br>
And slay them or expel them from the land.<br>
Therefore begrudging neither augury<br>
Nor other divination that is thine,<br>
O save thyself, thy country, and thy king,<br>
Save all from this defilement of blood shed.<br>
On thee we rest. This is man’s highest end,<br>
To others’ service all his powers to lend.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
TEIRESIAS.<br>
Alas, alas, what misery to be wise<br>
When wisdom profits nothing! This old lore<br>
I had forgotten; else I were not here.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
What ails thee? Why this melancholy mood?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
TEIRESIAS.<br>
Let me go home; prevent me not; ’twere best<br>
That thou shouldst bear thy burden and I mine.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
For shame! no true-born Theban patriot<br>
Would thus withhold the word of prophecy.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
TEIRESIAS.<br>
<i>Thy</i> words, O king, are wide of the mark, and I<br>
For fear lest I too trip like thee...<br>

 speak,<br>
Withhold not, I adjure thee, if thou know’st,<br>
Thy knowledge. We are all thy suppliants.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
TEIRESIAS.<br>
Aye, for ye all are witless, but my voice<br>
Will ne’er reveal my miseries—or thine.<a href="#linknote-2" id="linknoteref-2" class="pginternal">2</a><br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
What then, thou knowest, and yet willst not speak!<br>
Wouldst thou betray us and destroy the State?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
TEIRESIAS.<br>
I will not vex myself nor thee. Why ask<br>
Thus idly what from me thou shalt not learn?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Monster! thy silence would incense a flint.<br>
Will nothing loose thy tongue? Can nothing melt thee,<br>
Or shake thy dogged taciturnity?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
TEIRESIAS.<br>
Thou blam’st my mood and seest not thine own<br>
Wherewith thou art mated; no, thou taxest me.<br>
</p>

OEDIPUS.<br>
And who could stay his choler when he heard<br>
How insolently thou dost flout the State?<br>

TEIRESIAS.<br>
Well, it will come what will, though I be mute.<br>

OEDIPUS.<br>
Since come it must, thy duty is to tell me.<br>
</p>

TEIRESIAS.<br>
I have no more to say; storm as thou willst,<br>
And give the rein to all thy pent-up rage.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Yea, I am wroth, and will not stint my words,<br>
But speak my whole mind. Thou methinks thou art he,<br>
Who planned the crime, aye, and performed it too,<br>
All save the assassination; and if thou<br>
Hadst not been blind, I had been sworn to boot<br>
That thou alone didst do the bloody deed.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
TEIRESIAS.<br>
Is it so? Then I charge thee to abide<br>
By thine own proclamation; from this day<br>
Speak not to these or me. Thou art the man,<br>
Thou the accursed polluter of this land.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Vile slanderer, thou blurtest forth these taunts,<br>
And think’st forsooth as seer to go scot free.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
TEIRESIAS.<br>
Yea, I am free, strong in the strength of truth.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Who was thy teacher? not methinks thy art.<br>

TEIRESIAS.<br>
Didst miss my sense wouldst thou goad me on?<br>

<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
I but half caught thy meaning; say it again.<br>

I say thou art the murderer of the man<br>
Whose murderer thou pursuest.<br>

 shalt rue it<br>
Twice to repeat so gross a calumny.<br>

Must I say more to aggravate thy rage?<br>
</p>

OEDIPUS.<br>
Say all thou wilt; it will be but waste of breath.<br>

Poor fool to utter gibes at me which all<br>
Here present will cast back on thee ere long.<br>

OEDIPUS.<br>
Offspring of endless Night, thou hast no power<br>
O’er me or any man who sees the sun.<br>

TEIRESIAS.<br>
No, for thy weird is not to fall by me.<br>
I leave to Apollo what concerns the god.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Is this a plot of Creon, or thine own?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
TEIRESIAS.<br>
Not Creon, thou thyself art thine own bane.<br>

<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
O wealth and empiry and skill by skill<br>
Outwitted in the battlefield of life,<br>
What spite and envy follow in your train!<br>
See, for this crown the State conferred on me.<br>
A gift, a thing I sought not, for this crown<br>
The trusty Creon, my familiar friend,<br>
Hath lain in wait to oust me and suborned<br>
This mountebank, this juggling charlatan,<br>
This tricksy beggar-priest, for gain alone<br>
Keen-eyed, but in his proper art stone-blind.<br>
Say, sirrah, hast thou ever proved thyself<br>
A prophet? When the riddling Sphinx was here<br>
Why hadst thou no deliverance for this folk?<br>
And yet the riddle was not to be solved<br>
By guess-work but required the prophet’s art;<br>
Wherein thou wast found lacking; neither birds<br>
Nor sign from heaven helped thee, but <i>I</i> came,<br>
The simple Oedipus; <i>I</i> stopped her mouth<br>
By mother wit, untaught of auguries.<br>
This is the man whom thou wouldst undermine,<br>
In hope to reign with Creon in my stead.<br>
Methinks that thou and thine abettor soon<br>
Will rue your plot to drive the scapegoat out.<br>
Thank thy grey hairs that thou hast still to learn<br>
What chastisement such arrogance deserves.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
To us it seems that both the seer and thou,<br>
O Oedipus, have spoken angry words.<br>
This is no time to wrangle but consult<br>
How best we may fulfill the oracle.<br>

<p class="drama">
TEIRESIAS.<br>
King as thou art, free speech at least is mine<br>
To make reply; in this I am thy peer.<br>
I own no lord but Loxias; him I serve<br>
And ne’er can stand enrolled as Creon’s man.<br>
Thus then I answer: since thou hast not spared<br>
To twit me with my blindness—thou hast eyes,<br>
Yet see’st not in what misery thou art fallen,<br>
Nor where thou dwellest nor with whom for mate.<br>
Dost know thy lineage? Nay, thou know’st it not,<br>
And all unwitting art a double foe<br>
To thine own kin, the living and the dead;<br>
Aye and the dogging curse of mother and sire<br>
One day shall drive thee, like a two-edged sword,<br>
Beyond our borders, and the eyes that now<br>
See clear shall henceforward endless night.<br>
Ah whither shall thy bitter cry not reach,<br>
What crag in all Cithaeron but shall then<br>
Reverberate thy wail, when thou hast found<br>
With what a hymeneal thou wast borne<br>
Home, but to no fair haven, on the gale!<br>
Aye, and a flood of ills thou guessest not<br>
Shall set thyself and children in one line.<br>
Flout then both Creon and my words, for none<br>
Of mortals shall be striken worse than thou.<br>

Such am I—as it seems to thee a fool,<br>
But to the parents who begat thee, wise.<br>

’Tis time I left thee. Come, boy, take me home.<br>

Aye, take him quickly, for his presence irks<br>
And lets me; gone, thou canst not plague me more.<br>

TEIRESIAS.<br>
I go, but first will tell thee why I came.<br>
Thy frown I dread not, for thou canst not harm me.<br>
Hear then: this man whom thou hast sought to arrest<br>
With threats and warrants this long while, the wretch<br>
Who murdered Laius—that man is here.<br>
He passes for an alien in the land<br>
But soon shall prove a Theban, native born.<br>
And yet his fortune brings him little joy;<br>
For blind of seeing, clad in beggar’s weeds,<br>
For purple robes, and leaning on his staff,<br>
To a strange land he soon shall grope his way.<br>
And of the children, inmates of his home,<br>
He shall be proved the brother and the sire,<br>
Of her who bare him son and husband both,<br>
Co-partner, and assassin of his sire.<br>
Go in and ponder this, and if thou find<br>
That I have missed the mark, henceforth declare<br>
I have no wit nor skill in prophecy.<br>
[Exeunt TEIRESIAS and OEDIPUS]<br>

CHORUS.<br>
(Str. 1)<br>
Who is he by voice immortal named from Pythia’s rocky cell,<br>
Doer of foul deeds of bloodshed, horrors that no tongue can tell?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A foot for flight he needs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fleeter than storm-swift steeds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For on his heels doth follow,<br>
Armed with the lightnings of his Sire, Apollo.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like sleuth-hounds too<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fates pursue.<br>

Yea, but now flashed forth the summons from Parnassus’ snowy peak,<br>
“Near and far the undiscovered doer of this murder seek!”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now like a sullen bull he roves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through forest brakes and upland groves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And vainly seeks to fly<br>

Still by the avenging Phoebus sped,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Earth’s mid shrine.<br>
(Str. 2)<br>
Sore perplexed am I by the words of the master seer.<br>
Are they true, are they false? I know not and bridle my tongue for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fear,<br>
Fluttered with vague surmise; nor present nor future is clear.<br>
Quarrel of ancient date or in days still near know I none<br>
Twixt the Labdacidan house and our ruler, Polybus’ son.<br>
Proof is there none: how then can I challenge our King’s good name,<br>
How in a blood-feud join for an untracked deed of shame?<br>
<br>
(Ant. 2)<br>
All wise are Zeus and Apollo, and nothing is hid from their ken;<br>
They are gods; and in wits a man may surpass his fellow men;<br>
But that a mortal seer knows more than I know—where<br>
Hath this been proven? Or how without sign assured, can I blame<br>
Him who saved our State when the winged songstress came,<br>
Tested and tried in the light of us all, like gold assayed?<br>
How can I now assent when a crime is on Oedipus laid?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Friends, countrymen, I learn King Oedipus<br>
Hath laid against me a most grievous charge,<br>
And come to you protesting. If he deems<br>
That I have harmed or injured him in aught<br>
By word or deed in this our present trouble,<br>
I care not to prolong the span of life,<br>
Thus ill-reputed; for the calumny<br>
Hits not a single blot, but blasts my name,<br>
If by the general voice I am denounced<br>
False to the State and false by you my friends.<br>

OEDIPUS.<br>
Sirrah, what mak’st thou here? Dost thou presume<br>
To approach my doors, thou brazen-faced rogue,<br>
My murderer and the filcher of my crown?<br>
Come, answer this, didst thou detect in me<br>
Some touch of cowardice or witlessness,<br>
That made thee undertake this enterprise?<br>
I seemed forsooth too simple to perceive<br>
The serpent stealing on me in the dark,<br>
Or else too weak to scotch it when I saw.<br>
This <i>thou</i> art witless seeking to possess<br>
Without a following or friends the crown,<br>
A prize that followers and wealth must win.<br>

Attend me. Thou hast spoken, ’tis my turn<br>
To make reply. Then having heard me, judge.<br>

Thou art glib of tongue, but I am slow to learn<br>
Of thee; I know too well thy venomous hate.<br>

If thou dost hold a kinsman may be wronged,<br>
And no pains follow, thou art much to seek.<br>

Therein thou judgest rightly, but this wrong<br>
That thou allegest—tell me what it is.<br>

Should call the priest?<br>

Yea, and it is that proves thee a false friend.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Not so, if thou wouldst reason with thyself,<br>
As I with myself. First, I bid thee think,<br>
Would any mortal choose a troubled reign<br>
Of terrors rather than secure repose,<br>
If the same power were given him? As for me,<br>
I have no natural craving for the name<br>
Of king, preferring to do kingly deeds,<br>
And so thinks every sober-minded man.<br>
Now all my needs are satisfied through thee,<br>
And I have naught to fear; but were I king,<br>
My acts would oft run counter to my will.<br>
How could a title then have charms for me<br>
Above the sweets of boundless influence?<br>
I am not so infatuate as to grasp<br>
The shadow when I hold the substance fast.<br>
Now all men cry me Godspeed! wish me well,<br>
And every suitor seeks to gain my ear,<br>
If he would hope to win a grace from thee.<br>
Why should I leave the better, choose the worse?<br>
That were sheer madness, and I am not mad.<br>
No such ambition ever tempted me,<br>
Nor would I have a share in such intrigue.<br>
And if thou doubt me, first to Delphi go,<br>
There ascertain if my report was true<br>
Of the god’s answer; next investigate<br>
If with the seer I plotted or conspired,<br>
And if it prove so, sentence me to death,<br>
Not by thy voice alone, but mine and thine.<br>
But O condemn me not, without appeal,<br>
On bare suspicion. ’Tis not right to adjudge<br>
Bad men at random good, or good men bad.<br>
I would as lief a man should cast away<br>
The thing he counts most precious, his own life,<br>
As spurn a true friend. Thou wilt learn in time<br>
The truth, for time alone reveals the just;<br>
A villain is detected in a day.<br>

He points me out as Laius’ murderer.<br>

<p class="drama">
JOCASTA.<br>
Of his own knowledge or upon report?<br>

OEDIPUS.<br>
He is too cunning to commit himself,<br>
And makes a mouthpiece of a knavish seer.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
JOCASTA.<br>
Then thou mayest ease thy conscience on that score.<br>
Listen and I’ll convince thee that no man<br>
Hath scot or lot in the prophetic art.<br>
Here is the proof in brief. An oracle<br>
Once came to Laius (I will not say<br>
’Twas from the Delphic god himself, but from<br>
His ministers) declaring he was doomed<br>
To perish by the hand of his own son,<br>
A child that should be born to him by me.<br>
Now Laius—so at least report affirmed—<br>
Was murdered on a day by highwaymen,<br>
No natives, at a spot where three roads meet.<br>
As for the child, it was but three days old,<br>
When Laius, its ankles pierced and pinned<br>
Together, gave it to be cast away<br>
By others on the trackless mountain side.<br>
So then Apollo brought it not to pass<br>
The child should be his father’s murderer,<br>
Or the dread terror find accomplishment,<br>
And Laius be slain by his own son.<br>
Such was the prophet’s horoscope. O king,<br>
Regard it not. Whate’er the god deems fit<br>
To search, himself unaided will reveal.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
What memories, what wild tumult of the soul<br>
Came o’er me, lady, as I heard thee speak!<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
JOCASTA.<br>
What mean’st thou? What has shocked and startled thee?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Methought I heard thee say that Laius<br>
Was murdered at the meeting of three roads.<br>

With silver; and not unlike thee in form.<br>

<p class="drama">
JOCASTA.<br>
I quail; but ask, and I will answer all.<br>

OEDIPUS.<br>
Had he but few attendants or a train<br>

</p>
<p class="drama">
JOCASTA.<br>
They were but five in all, and one of them<br>
A herald; Laius in a mule-car rode.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Alas! ’tis clear as noonday now. But say,<br>
Lady, who carried this report to Thebes?<br>

A serf, the sole survivor who returned.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Haply he is at hand or in the house?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
JOCASTA.<br>
No, for as soon as he returned and found<br>
Thee reigning in the stead of Laius slain,<br>
He clasped my hand and supplicated me<br>
To send him to the alps and pastures, where<br>
He might be farthest from the sight of Thebes.<br>
And so I sent him. ’Twas an honest slave<br>
And well deserved some better recompense.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Fetch him at once. I fain would see the man.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
JOCASTA.<br>
He shall be brought; but wherefore summon him?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Lady, I fear my tongue has overrun<br>
Discretion; therefore I would question him.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
JOCASTA.<br>
Well, he shall come, but may not I too claim<br>
To share the burden of thy heart, my king?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
And thou shalt not be frustrate of thy wish.<br>
Now my imaginings have gone so far.<br>
Who has a higher claim that thou to hear<br>
My tale of dire adventures? Listen then.<br>
My sire was Polybus of Corinth, and<br>
My mother Merope, a Dorian;<br>
And I was held the foremost citizen,<br>
Till a strange thing befell me, strange indeed,<br>
Yet scarce deserving all the heat it stirred.<br>
A roisterer at some banquet, flown with wine,<br>
Shouted “Thou art not true son of thy sire.”<br>
It irked me, but I stomached for the nonce<br>
The insult; on the morrow I sought out<br>
My mother and my sire and questioned them.<br>
They were indignant at the random slur<br>
Cast on my parentage and did their best<br>
To comfort me, but still the venomed barb<br>
Rankled, for still the scandal spread and grew.<br>
So privily without their leave I went<br>
To Delphi, and Apollo sent me back<br>
Baulked of the knowledge that I came to seek.<br>
But other grievous things he prophesied,<br>
Woes, lamentations, mourning, portents dire;<br>
To wit I should defile my mother’s bed<br>
And raise up seed too loathsome to behold,<br>
And slay the father from whose loins I sprang.<br>
Then, lady,—thou shalt hear the very truth—<br>
As I drew near the triple-branching roads,<br>
A herald met me and a man who sat<br>
In a car drawn by colts—as in thy tale—<br>
The man in front and the old man himself<br>
Threatened to thrust me rudely from the path,<br>
Then jostled by the charioteer in wrath<br>
I struck him, and the old man, seeing this,<br>
Watched till I passed and from his car brought down<br>
Full on my head the double-pointed goad.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet was I quits with him and more; one stroke<br>
Of my good staff sufficed to fling him clean<br>
Out of the chariot seat and laid him prone.<br>
And so I slew them every one. But if<br>
Betwixt this stranger there was aught in common<br>
With Laius, who more miserable than I,<br>
What mortal could you find more god-abhorred?<br>
Wretch whom no sojourner, no citizen<br>
May harbor or address, whom all are bound<br>
To harry from their homes. And this same curse<br>
Was laid on me, and laid by none but me.<br>
Yea with these hands all gory I pollute<br>
The bed of him I slew. Say, am I vile?<br>
Am I not utterly unclean, a wretch<br>
Doomed to be banished, and in banishment<br>
Forgo the sight of all my dearest ones,<br>
And never tread again my native earth;<br>
Or else to wed my mother and slay my sire,<br>
Polybus, who begat me and upreared?<br>
If one should say, this is the handiwork<br>
Of some inhuman power, who could blame<br>
His judgment? But, ye pure and awful gods,<br>
Forbid, forbid that I should see that day!<br>
May I be blotted out from living men<br>
Ere such a plague spot set on me its brand!<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
We too, O king, are troubled; but till thou<br>
Hast questioned the survivor, still hope on.<br>
</p>

My hope is faint, but still enough survives<br>
To bid me bide the coming of this herd.<br>

JOCASTA.<br>
Suppose him here, what wouldst thou learn of him?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">

I’ll tell thee, lady; if his tale agrees<br>
With thine, I shall have ’scaped calamity.<br>

And what of special import did I say?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
In thy report of what the herdsman said<br>
Laius was slain by robbers; now if he<br>
Still speaks of robbers, not a robber, I<br>
Slew him not; “one” with “many” cannot square.<br>
But if he says one lonely wayfarer,<br>
The last link wanting to my guilt is forged.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
JOCASTA.<br>
Well, rest assured, his tale ran thus at first,<br>
Nor can he now retract what then he said;<br>
Not I alone but all our townsfolk heard it.<br>
E’en should he vary somewhat in his story,<br>
He cannot make the death of Laius<br>
In any wise jump with the oracle.<br>
For Loxias said expressly he was doomed<br>
To die by my child’s hand, but he, poor babe,<br>
He shed no blood, but perished first himself.<br>
So much for divination. Henceforth I<br>
Will look for signs neither to right nor left.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Thou reasonest well. Still I would have thee send<br>
And fetch the bondsman hither. See to it.<br>

Yes, having measured the full span of years.<br>

OEDIPUS.<br>
Out on it, lady! why should one regard<br>
The Pythian hearth or birds that scream i’ the air?<br>
Did they not point at me as doomed to slay<br>
My father? but he’s dead and in his grave<br>
And here am I who ne’er unsheathed a sword;<br>
Unless the longing for his absent son<br>
Killed him and so <i>I</i> slew him in a sense.<br>

Dust, ashes, nothing, dead as Polybus.<br>

Best live a careless life from hand to mouth.<br>
This wedlock with thy mother fear not thou.<br>
How oft it chances that in dreams a man<br>
Has wed his mother! He who least regards<br>
Such brainsick phantasies lives most at ease.<br>

A mystery, or may a stranger hear it?<br>

OEDIPUS.<br>
Aye, ’tis no secret. Loxias once foretold<br>
That I should mate with mine own mother, and shed<br>
With my own hands the blood of my own sire.<br>

A home distant; and I trove abroad,<br>
But missed the sweetest sight, my parents’ face.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
MESSENGER.<br>
Was this the fear that exiled thee from home?<br>

<p class="drama">
MESSENGER.<br>
Since Polybus was naught to thee in blood.<br>

Let the storm burst, my fixed resolve still holds,<br>

Who rank myself as Fortune’s favorite child,<br>
The giver of good gifts, shall not be shamed.<br>

With her own seed, a monstrous progeny.<br>
Then she bewailed the marriage bed whereon<br>
Poor wretch, she had conceived a double brood,<br>
Husband by husband, children by her child.<br>
What happened after that I cannot tell,<br>
Nor how the end befell, for with a shriek<br>
Burst on us Oedipus; all eyes were fixed<br>
On Oedipus, as up and down he strode,<br>
Nor could we mark her agony to the end.<br>
For stalking to and fro “A sword!” he cried,<br>
“Where is the wife, no wife, the teeming womb<br>
That bore a double harvest, me and mine?”<br>
And in his frenzy some supernal power<br>
(No mortal, surely, none of us who watched him)<br>
Guided his footsteps; with a terrible shriek,<br>
As though one beckoned him, he crashed against<br>
The folding doors, and from their staples forced<br>
The wrenched bolts and hurled himself within.<br>
Then we beheld the woman hanging there,<br>
A running noose entwined about her neck.<br>
But when he saw her, with a maddened roar<br>
He loosed the cord; and when her wretched corpse<br>
Lay stretched on earth, what followed—O ’twas dread!<br>
He tore the golden brooches that upheld<br>
Her queenly robes, upraised them high and smote<br>
Full on his eye-balls, uttering words like these:<br>
“No more shall ye behold such sights of woe,<br>
Deeds I have suffered and myself have wrought;<br>
Henceforward quenched in darkness shall ye see<br>
Those ye should ne’er have seen; now blind to those<br>
Whom, when I saw, I vainly yearned to know.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was the burden of his moan, whereto,<br>
Not once but oft, he struck with his hand uplift<br>
His eyes, and at each stroke the ensanguined orbs<br>
Bedewed his beard, not oozing drop by drop,<br>
But one black gory downpour, thick as hail.<br>
Such evils, issuing from the double source,<br>
Have whelmed them both, confounding man and wife.<br>
Till now the storied fortune of this house<br>
Was fortunate indeed; but from this day<br>
Woe, lamentation, ruin, death, disgrace,<br>
All ills that can be named, all, all are theirs.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
But hath he still no respite from his pain?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
SECOND MESSENGER.<br>
He cries, “Unbar the doors and let all Thebes<br>
Behold the slayer of his sire, his mother’s—”<br>
That shameful word my lips may not repeat.<br>
He vows to fly self-banished from the land,<br>
Nor stay to bring upon his house the curse<br>
Himself had uttered; but he has no strength<br>
Nor one to guide him, and his torture’s more<br>
Than man can suffer, as yourselves will see.<br>
For lo, the palace portals are unbarred,<br>
And soon ye shall behold a sight so sad<br>
That he who must abhorred would pity it.<br>

For, had I sight, I know not with what eyes<br>
I could have met my father in the shades,<br>
Or my poor mother, since against the twain<br>
I sinned, a sin no gallows could atone.<br>
Aye, but, ye say, the sight of children joys<br>
A parent’s eyes. What, born as mine were born?<br>
No, such a sight could never bring me joy;<br>
Nor this fair city with its battlements,<br>
Its temples and the statues of its gods,<br>
Sights from which I, now wretchedst of all,<br>
Once ranked the foremost Theban in all Thebes,<br>
By my own sentence am cut off, condemned<br>
By my own proclamation ’gainst the wretch,<br>
The miscreant by heaven itself declared<br>
Unclean—and of the race of Laius.<br>
Thus branded as a felon by myself,<br>
How had I dared to look you in the face?<br>
Nay, had I known a way to choke the springs<br>
Of hearing, I had never shrunk to make<br>
A dungeon of this miserable frame,<br>
Cut off from sight and hearing; for ’tis bliss<br>
to bide in regions sorrow cannot reach.<br>
Why didst thou harbor me, Cithaeron, why<br>
Didst thou not take and slay me? Then I never<br>
Had shown to men the secret of my birth.<br>
O Polybus, O Corinth, O my home,<br>
Home of my ancestors (so wast thou called)<br>
How fair a nursling then I seemed, how foul<br>
The canker that lay festering in the bud!<br>
Now is the blight revealed of root and fruit.<br>
Ye triple high-roads, and thou hidden glen,<br>
Coppice, and pass where meet the three-branched ways,<br>
Ye drank my blood, the life-blood these hands spilt,<br>
My father’s; do ye call to mind perchance<br>
Those deeds of mine ye witnessed and the work<br>
I wrought thereafter when I came to Thebes?<br>
O fatal wedlock, thou didst give me birth,<br>
And, having borne me, sowed again my seed,<br>
Mingling the blood of fathers, brothers, children,<br>
Brides, wives and mothers, an incestuous brood,<br>
All horrors that are wrought beneath the sun,<br>
Horrors so foul to name them were unmeet.<br>
O, I adjure you, hide me anywhere<br>
Far from this land, or slay me straight, or cast me<br>
Down to the depths of ocean out of sight.<br>
Come hither, deign to touch an abject wretch;<br>
Draw near and fear not; I myself must bear<br>
The load of guilt that none but I can share.<br>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>
<p>
Oedipus, the blind and banished King of Thebes, has come in his wanderings to
Colonus, a deme of Athens, led by his daughter Antigone. He sits to rest on a
rock just within a sacred grove of the Furies and is bidden depart by a passing
native. But Oedipus, instructed by an oracle that he had reached his final
resting-place, refuses to stir, and the stranger consents to go and consult the
Elders of Colonus (the Chorus of the Play). Conducted to the spot they pity at
first the blind beggar and his daughter, but on learning his name they are
horror-striken and order him to quit the land. He appeals to the world-famed
hospitality of Athens and hints at the blessings that his coming will confer on
the State. They agree to await the decision of King Theseus. From Theseus
Oedipus craves protection in life and burial in Attic soil; the benefits that
will accrue shall be told later. Theseus departs having promised to aid and
befriend him. No sooner has he gone than Creon enters with an armed guard who
seize Antigone and carry her off (Ismene, the other sister, they have already
captured) and he is about to lay hands on Oedipus, when Theseus, who has heard
the tumult, hurries up and, upbraiding Creon for his lawless act, threatens to
detain him till he has shown where the captives are and restored them. In the
next scene Theseus returns bringing with him the rescued maidens. He informs
Oedipus that a stranger who has taken sanctuary at the altar of Poseidon wishes
to see him. It is Polyneices who has come to crave his father’s forgiveness and
blessing, knowing by an oracle that victory will fall to the side that Oedipus
espouses. But Oedipus spurns the hypocrite, and invokes a dire curse on both
his unnatural sons. A sudden clap of thunder is heard, and as peal follows
peal, Oedipus is aware that his hour is come and bids Antigone summon Theseus.
Self-guided he leads the way to the spot where death should overtake him,
attended by Theseus and his daughters. Halfway he bids his daughters farewell,
and what followed none but Theseus knew. He was not (so the Messenger reports)
for the gods took him.

<h2>OEDIPUS AT COLONUS</h2>
<p class="noindent">
Enter the blind OEDIPUS led by his daughter, ANTIGONE.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Child of an old blind sire, Antigone,<br>
What region, say, whose city have we reached?<br>
Who will provide today with scanted dole<br>
This wanderer? ’Tis little that he craves,<br>
And less obtains—that less enough for me;<br>
For I am taught by suffering to endure,<br>
And the long years that have grown old with me,<br>
And last not least, by true nobility.<br>
My daughter, if thou seest a resting place<br>
On common ground or by some sacred grove,<br>
Stay me and set me down. Let us discover<br>
Where we have come, for strangers must inquire<br>
Of denizens, and do as they are bid.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
Long-suffering father, Oedipus, the towers<br>
That fence the city still are faint and far;<br>
But where we stand is surely holy ground;<br>
A wilderness of laurel, olive, vine;<br>
Within a choir or songster nightingales<br>
Are warbling. On this native seat of rock<br>
Rest; for an old man thou hast traveled far.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Guide these dark steps and seat me there secure.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
If time can teach, I need not to be told.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Say, prithee, if thou knowest, where we are.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
Athens I recognize, but not the spot.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
That much we heard from every wayfarer.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
Shall I go on and ask about the place?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Yes, daughter, if it be inhabited.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
Sure there are habitations; but no need<br>
To leave thee; yonder is a man hard by.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
What, moving hitherward and on his way?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
Say rather, here already. Ask him straight<br>
The needful questions, for the man is here.<br>
[Enter STRANGER]<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
O stranger, as I learn from her whose eyes<br>
Must serve both her and me, that thou art here<br>
Sent by some happy chance to serve our doubts—<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
STRANGER.<br>
First quit that seat, then question me at large:<br>
The spot thou treadest on is holy ground.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
What is the site, to what god dedicate?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
STRANGER.<br>
Inviolable, untrod; goddesses,<br>
Dread brood of Earth and Darkness, here abide.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>

STRANGER.<br>
The Gracious Ones, All-seeing, so our folk<br>
Call them, but elsewhere other names are rife.<br>

STRANGER.<br>
Whate’er I know thou too shalt know; the place<br>
Is all to great Poseidon consecrate.<br>
Hard by, the Titan, he who bears the torch,<br>
Prometheus, has his worship; but the spot<br>
Thou treadest, the Brass-footed Threshold named,<br>
Is Athens’ bastion, and the neighboring lands<br>
Claim as their chief and patron yonder knight<br>
Colonus, and in common bear his name.<br>
Such, stranger, is the spot, to fame unknown,<br>
But dear to us its native worshipers.<br>

Not in the city. They will soon decide<br>
Whether thou art to rest or go thy way.<br>

Stern-visaged queens, since coming to this land<br>
First in your sanctuary I bent the knee,<br>
Frown not on me or Phoebus, who, when erst<br>
He told me all my miseries to come,<br>
Spake of this respite after many years,<br>
Some haven in a far-off land, a rest<br>
Vouchsafed at last by dread divinities.<br>
“There,” said he, “shalt thou round thy weary life,<br>
A blessing to the land wherein thou dwell’st,<br>
But to the land that cast thee forth, a curse.”<br>
And of my weird he promised signs should come,<br>
Earthquake, or thunderclap, or lightning flash.<br>
And now I recognize as yours the sign<br>
That led my wanderings to this your grove;<br>
Else had I never lighted on you first,<br>
A wineless man on your seat of native rock.<br>
O goddesses, fulfill Apollo’s word,<br>
Grant me some consummation of my life,<br>
If haply I appear not all too vile,<br>
A thrall to sorrow worse than any slave.<br>
Hear, gentle daughters of primeval Night,<br>
Hear, namesake of great Pallas; Athens, first<br>
Of cities, pity this dishonored shade,<br>
The ghost of him who once was Oedipus.<br>
</p>

Hush! for I see some grey-beards on their way,<br>
Their errand to spy out our resting-place.<br>

Into the covert from the public road,<br>

Striken, I struck the striker back again?<br>
E’en had I known, no villainy ’twould prove:<br>

To ruin; my destroyers knew it well,<br>
Wherefore, I pray you, sirs, in Heaven’s name,<br>
Even as ye bade me quit my seat, defend me.<br>
O pay not a lip service to the gods<br>
And wrong them of their dues. Bethink ye well,<br>
The eye of Heaven beholds the just of men,<br>

Has one sole godless sinner found escape.<br>
Stand then on Heaven’s side and never blot<br>
Athens’ fair scutcheon by abetting wrong.<br>
I came to you a suppliant, and you pledged<br>
Your honor; O preserve me to the end,<br>

A holy and god-fearing man is here<br>

With the one thrall who yet is true to me.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Thy valiant brothers, where are they at need?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
They are—enough, ’tis now their darkest hour.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Out on the twain! The thoughts and actions all<br>
Are framed and modeled on Egyptian ways.<br>
For there the men sit at the loom indoors<br>
While the wives slave abroad for daily bread.<br>
So you, my children—those whom I behooved<br>
To bear the burden, stay at home like girls,<br>
While in their stead my daughters moil and drudge,<br>
Lightening their father’s misery. The one<br>
Since first she grew from girlish feebleness<br>
To womanhood has been the old man’s guide<br>
And shared my weary wandering, roaming oft<br>
Hungry and footsore through wild forest ways,<br>
In drenching rains and under scorching suns,<br>
Careless herself of home and ease, if so<br>
Her sire might have her tender ministry.<br>
And thou, my child, whilom thou wentest forth,<br>
Eluding the Cadmeians’ vigilance,<br>
To bring thy father all the oracles<br>
Concerning Oedipus, and didst make thyself<br>
My faithful lieger, when they banished me.<br>
And now what mission summons thee from home,<br>
What news, Ismene, hast thou for thy father?<br>
This much I know, thou com’st not empty-handed,<br>
Without a warning of some new alarm.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
The toil and trouble, father, that I bore<br>
To find thy lodging-place and how thou faredst,<br>
I spare thee; surely ’twere a double pain<br>
To suffer, first in act and then in telling;<br>
’Tis the misfortune of thine ill-starred sons<br>
I come to tell thee. At the first they willed<br>
To leave the throne to Creon, minded well<br>
Thus to remove the inveterate curse of old,<br>
A canker that infected all thy race.<br>
But now some god and an infatuate soul<br>
Have stirred betwixt them a mad rivalry<br>
To grasp at sovereignty and kingly power.<br>
Today the hot-branded youth, the younger born,<br>
Is keeping Polyneices from the throne,<br>
His elder, and has thrust him from the land.<br>
The banished brother (so all Thebes reports)<br>
Fled to the vale of Argos, and by help<br>
Of new alliance there and friends in arms,<br>
Swears he will stablish Argos straight as lord<br>
Of the Cadmeian land, or, if he fail,<br>
Exalt the victor to the stars of heaven.<br>
This is no empty tale, but deadly truth,<br>
My father; and how long thy agony,<br>
Ere the gods pity thee, I cannot tell.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Hast thou indeed then entertained a hope<br>
The gods at last will turn and rescue me?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
Yea, so I read these latest oracles.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
What oracles? What hath been uttered, child?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
Thy country (so it runs) shall yearn in time<br>
To have thee for their weal alive or dead.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
And who could gain by such a one as I?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
On thee, ’tis said, their sovereignty depends.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
So, when I cease to be, my worth begins.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
The gods, who once abased, uplift thee now.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Poor help to raise an old man fallen in youth.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
Howe’er that be, ’tis for this cause alone<br>
That Creon comes to thee—and comes anon.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
With what intent, my daughter? Tell me plainly.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
To plant thee near the Theban land, and so<br>
Keep thee within their grasp, yet now allow<br>
Thy foot to pass beyond their boundaries.<br>

What gain they, if I lay outside?<br>

 tomb,<br>
If disappointed, brings on them a curse.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
It needs no god to tell what’s plain to sense.<br>

<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
Therefore they fain would have thee close at hand,<br>
Not where thou wouldst be master of thyself.<br>

Hath Phoebus spoken thus concerning me?<br>

ISMENE.<br>
So say the envoys who returned to Thebes.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
And can a son of mine have heard of this?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
Yea, both alike, and know its import well.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
They knew it, yet the ignoble greed of rule<br>
Outweighed all longing for their sire’s return.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
Grievous thy words, yet I must own them true.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
Then may the gods ne’er quench their fatal feud,<br>
And mine be the arbitrament of the fight,<br>
For which they now are arming, spear to spear;<br>
That neither he who holds the scepter now<br>
May keep this throne, nor he who fled the realm<br>
Return again. <i>They</i> never raised a hand,<br>
When I their sire was thrust from hearth and home,<br>
When I was banned and banished, what recked they?<br>
Say you ’twas done at my desire, a grace<br>
Which the state, yielding to my wish, allowed?<br>
Not so; for, mark you, on that very day<br>
When in the tempest of my soul I craved<br>
Death, even death by stoning, none appeared<br>
To further that wild longing, but anon,<br>
When time had numbed my anguish and I felt<br>
My wrath had all outrun those errors past,<br>
Then, then it was the city went about<br>
By force to oust me, respited for years;<br>
And then my sons, who should as sons have helped,<br>
Did nothing: and, one little word from them<br>
Was all I needed, and they spoke no word,<br>
But let me wander on for evermore,<br>
A banished man, a beggar. These two maids<br>
Their sisters, girls, gave all their sex could give,<br>
Food and safe harborage and filial care;<br>
While their two brethren sacrificed their sire<br>
For lust of power and sceptred sovereignty.<br>
No! me they ne’er shall win for an ally,<br>
Nor will this Theban kingship bring them gain;<br>
That know I from this maiden’s oracles,<br>
And those old prophecies concerning me,<br>
Which Phoebus now at length has brought to pass.<br>
Come Creon then, come all the mightiest<br>
In Thebes to seek me; for if ye my friends,<br>
Championed by those dread Powers indigenous,<br>
Espouse my cause; then for the State ye gain<br>
A great deliverer, for my foemen bane.<br>

Oft had I heard of thee in times gone by—<br>
The bloody mutilation of thine eyes—<br>
And therefore know thee, son of Laius.<br>
All that I lately gathered on the way<br>
Made my conjecture doubly sure; and now<br>
Thy garb and that marred visage prove to me<br>
That thou art he. So pitying thine estate,<br>
Most ill-starred Oedipus, I fain would know<br>
What is the suit ye urge on me and Athens,<br>
Thou and the helpless maiden at thy side.<br>
Declare it; dire indeed must be the tale<br>
Whereat <i>I</i> should recoil. I too was reared,<br>
Like thee, in exile, and in foreign lands<br>
Wrestled with many perils, no man more.<br>
Wherefore no alien in adversity<br>
Shall seek in vain my succor, nor shalt thou;<br>
I know myself a mortal, and my share<br>
In what the morrow brings no more than thine.<br>

Theseus, thy words so apt, so generous<br>
So comfortable, need no long reply<br>

So without prologue I may utter now<br>
My brief petition, and the tale is told.<br>

Dear son of Aegeus, to the gods alone<br>
Is given immunity from eld and death;<br>
But nothing else escapes all-ruinous time.<br>
Earth’s might decays, the might of men decays,<br>
Honor grows cold, dishonor flourishes,<br>
There is no constancy ’twixt friend and friend,<br>
Or city and city; be it soon or late,<br>
Sweet turns to bitter, hate once more to love.<br>
If now ’tis sunshine betwixt Thebes and thee<br>
And not a cloud, Time in his endless course<br>
Gives birth to endless days and nights, wherein<br>
The merest nothing shall suffice to cut<br>
With serried spears your bonds of amity.<br>
Then shall my slumbering and buried corpse<br>
In its cold grave drink their warm life-blood up,<br>
If Zeus be Zeus and Phoebus still speak true.<br>
No more: ’tis ill to tear aside the veil<br>
Of mysteries; let me cease as I began:<br>
Enough if thou wilt keep thy plighted troth,<br>
Then shall thou ne’er complain that Oedipus<br>
Proved an unprofitable and thankless guest,<br>
Except the gods themselves shall play me false.<br>

First, he can claim the hospitality<br>
To which by mutual contract we stand pledged:<br>
Next, coming here, a suppliant to the gods,<br>

His favors therefore never will I spurn,<br>
But grant him the full rights of citizen;<br>
And, if it suits the stranger here to bide,<br>

Which of the two thou wilt. Thy choice is mine.<br>

CHORUS.<br>
(Str. 1)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast come to a steed-famed land for rest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O stranger worn with toil,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a land of all lands the goodliest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colonus’ glistening soil.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’Tis the haunt of the clear-voiced nightingale,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who hid in her bower, among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wine-dark ivy that wreathes the vale,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trilleth her ceaseless song;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she loves, where the clustering berries nod<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O’er a sunless, windless glade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spot by no mortal footstep trod,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pleasance kept for the Bacchic god,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he holds each night his revels wild<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the nymphs who fostered the lusty child.<br>
<br>
(Ant. 1)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fed each morn by the pearly dew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starred narcissi shine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a wreath with the crocus’ golden hue<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Mother and Daughter twine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never the sleepless fountains cease<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That feed Cephisus’ stream,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they swell earth’s bosom with quick increase,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their wave hath a crystal gleam.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Muses’ quire will never disdain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To visit this heaven-favored plain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the Cyprian queen of the golden rein.<br>
<br>
(Str. 2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here there grows, unpruned, untamed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terror to foemen’s spear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tree in Asian soil unnamed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Pelops’ Dorian isle unclaimed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-nurtured year by year;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’Tis the grey-leaved olive that feeds our boys;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor youth nor withering age destroys<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plant that the Olive Planter tends<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Grey-eyed Goddess herself defends.<br>
<br>
(Ant. 2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another gift, of all gifts the most<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prized by our fatherland, we boast—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The might of the horse, the might of the sea;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fame, Poseidon, we owe to thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son of Kronos, our king divine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who in these highways first didst fit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the mouth of horses the iron bit;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou too hast taught us to fashion meet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the arm of the rower the oar-blade fleet,<br>

CREON.<br>
Burghers, my noble friends, ye take alarm<br>
At my approach (I read it in your eyes),<br>
Fear nothing and refrain from angry words.<br>
I come with no ill purpose; I am old,<br>
And know the city whither I am come,<br>
Without a peer amongst the powers of Greece.<br>
It was by reason of my years that I<br>
Was chosen to persuade your guest and bring<br>
Him back to Thebes; not the delegate<br>
Of one man, but commissioned by the State,<br>
Since of all Thebans I have most bewailed,<br>
Being his kinsman, his most grievous woes.<br>
O listen to me, luckless Oedipus,<br>
Come home! The whole Cadmeian people claim<br>
With right to have thee back, I most of all,<br>
For most of all (else were I vile indeed)<br>
I mourn for thy misfortunes, seeing thee<br>
An aged outcast, wandering on and on,<br>
A beggar with one handmaid for thy stay.<br>
Ah! who had e’er imagined she could fall<br>
To such a depth of misery as this,<br>
To tend in penury thy stricken frame,<br>
A virgin ripe for wedlock, but unwed,<br>
A prey for any wanton ravisher?<br>
Seems it not cruel this reproach I cast<br>
On thee and on myself and all the race?<br>
Aye, but an open shame cannot be hid.<br>
Hide it, O hide it, Oedipus, thou canst.<br>
O, by our fathers’ gods, consent I pray;<br>
Come back to Thebes, come to thy father’s home,<br>
Bid Athens, as is meet, a fond farewell;<br>
Thebes thy old foster-mother claims thee first.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
OEDIPUS.<br>
O front of brass, thy subtle tongue would twist<br>
To thy advantage every plea of right<br>
Why try thy arts on me, why spread again<br>
Toils where ’twould gall me sorest to be snared?<br>
In old days when by self-wrought woes distraught,<br>
I yearned for exile as a glad release,<br>
Thy will refused the favor then I craved.<br>
But when my frenzied grief had spent its force,<br>
And I was fain to taste the sweets of home,<br>
Then thou wouldst thrust me from my country, then<br>
These ties of kindred were by thee ignored;<br>
And now again when thou behold’st this State<br>
And all its kindly people welcome me,<br>
Thou seek’st to part us, wrapping in soft words<br>
Hard thoughts. And yet what pleasure canst thou find<br>
In forcing friendship on unwilling foes?<br>
Suppose a man refused to grant some boon<br>
When you importuned him, and afterwards<br>
When you had got your heart’s desire, consented,<br>
Granting a grace from which all grace had fled,<br>
Would not such favor seem an empty boon?<br>
Yet such the boon thou profferest now to me,<br>
Fair in appearance, but when tested false.<br>
Yea, I will proved thee false, that these may hear;<br>
Thou art come to take me, not to take me home,<br>
But plant me on thy borders, that thy State<br>
May so escape annoyance from this land.<br>
<i>That</i> thou shalt never gain, but <i>this</i> instead—<br>
My ghost to haunt thy country without end;<br>
And for my sons, this heritage—no more—<br>
Just room to die in. Have not I more skill<br>
Than thou to draw the horoscope of Thebes?<br>
Are not my teachers surer guides than thine—<br>
Great Phoebus and the sire of Phoebus, Zeus?<br>
Thou art a messenger suborned, thy tongue<br>
Is sharper than a sword’s edge, yet thy speech<br>
Will bring thee more defeats than victories.<br>
Howbeit, I know I waste my words—begone,<br>
And leave me here; whate’er may be my lot,<br>
He lives not ill who lives withal content.<br>

As for this stranger, had I let my rage,<br>
Justly provoked, have play, he had not ’scaped<br>
Scathless and uncorrected at my hands.<br>
But now the laws to which himself appealed,<br>
These and none others shall adjudicate.<br>
Thou shalt not quit this land, till thou hast fetched<br>
The maidens and produced them in my sight.<br>
Thou hast offended both against myself<br>
And thine own race and country. Having come<br>
Unto a State that champions right and asks<br>
For every action warranty of law,<br>
Thou hast set aside the custom of the land,<br>
And like some freebooter art carrying off<br>
What plunder pleases thee, as if forsooth<br>
Thou thoughtest this a city without men,<br>
Or manned by slaves, and me a thing of naught.<br>
Yet not from Thebes this villainy was learnt;<br>
Thebes is not wont to breed unrighteous sons,<br>
Nor would she praise thee, if she learnt that thou<br>
Wert robbing me—aye and the gods to boot,<br>
Haling by force their suppliants, poor maids.<br>
Were I on Theban soil, to prosecute<br>
The justest claim imaginable, I<br>
Would never wrest by violence my own<br>
Without sanction of your State or King;<br>
I should behave as fits an outlander<br>
Living amongst a foreign folk, but thou<br>
Shamest a city that deserves it not,<br>
Even thine own, and plentitude of years<br>
Have made of thee an old man and a fool.<br>
Therefore again I charge thee as before,<br>
See that the maidens are restored at once,<br>
Unless thou would’st continue here by force<br>
And not by choice a sojourner; so much<br>
I tell thee home and what I say, I mean.<br>

CREON.<br>
Not deeming this city void of men<br>
Or counsel, son of Aegeus, as thou say’st<br>
I did what I have done; rather I thought<br>
Your people were not like to set such store<br>
by kin of mine and keep them ’gainst my will.<br>
Nor would they harbor, so I stood assured,<br>
A godless parricide, a reprobate<br>
Convicted of incestuous marriage ties.<br>
For on her native hill of Ares here<br>
(I knew your far-famed Areopagus)<br>
Sits Justice, and permits not vagrant folk<br>
To stay within your borders. In that faith<br>
I hunted down my quarry; and e’en then<br>
I had refrained but for the curses dire<br>
Wherewith he banned my kinsfolk and myself:<br>
Such wrong, methought, had warrant for my act.<br>
Anger has no old age but only death;<br>
The dead alone can feel no touch of spite.<br>

O shameless railer, think’st thou this abuse<br>
Defames my grey hairs rather than thine own?<br>
Murder and incest, deeds of horror, all<br>
Thou blurtest forth against me, all I have borne,<br>
No willing sinner; so it pleased the gods<br>
Wrath haply with my sinful race of old,<br>
Since thou could’st find no sin in me myself<br>
For which in retribution I was doomed<br>
To trespass thus against myself and mine.<br>
Answer me now, if by some oracle<br>
My sire was destined to a bloody end<br>
By a son’s hand, can this reflect on me,<br>
Me then unborn, begotten by no sire,<br>
Conceived in no mother’s womb? And if<br>
When born to misery, as born I was,<br>
I met my sire, not knowing whom I met<br>
or what I did, and slew him, how canst thou<br>
With justice blame the all-unconscious hand?<br>
And for my mother, wretch, art not ashamed,<br>
Seeing she was thy sister, to extort<br>
From me the story of her marriage, such<br>
A marriage as I straightway will proclaim.<br>
For I will speak; thy lewd and impious speech<br>
Has broken all the bonds of reticence.<br>
She was, ah woe is me! she was my mother;<br>
I knew it not, nor she; and she my mother<br>
Bare children to the son whom she had borne,<br>
A birth of shame. But this at least I know<br>
Wittingly thou aspersest her and me;<br>
But I unwitting wed, unwilling speak.<br>
Nay neither in this marriage or this deed<br>
Which thou art ever casting in my teeth—<br>
A murdered sire—shall I be held to blame.<br>
Come, answer me one question, if thou canst:<br>
If one should presently attempt thy life,<br>
Would’st thou, O man of justice, first inquire<br>
If the assassin was perchance thy sire,<br>
Or turn upon him? As thou lov’st thy life,<br>
On thy aggressor thou would’st turn, no stay<br>
Debating, if the law would bear thee out.<br>
Such was my case, and such the pass whereto<br>
The gods reduced me; and methinks my sire,<br>
Could he come back to life, would not dissent.<br>
Yet thou, for just thou art not, but a man<br>
Who sticks at nothing, if it serve his plea,<br>
Reproachest me with this before these men.<br>
It serves thy turn to laud great Theseus’ name,<br>
And Athens as a wisely governed State;<br>
Yet in thy flatteries one thing is to seek:<br>
If any land knows how to pay the gods<br>
Their proper rites, ’tis Athens most of all.<br>
This is the land whence thou wast fain to steal<br>
Their aged suppliant and hast carried off<br>
My daughters. Therefore to yon goddesses,<br>
I turn, adjure them and invoke their aid<br>
To champion my cause, that thou mayest learn<br>
What is the breed of men who guard this State.<br>

Lead on, I say, the captor’s caught, and fate<br>
Hath ta’en the fowler in the toils he spread;<br>
So soon are lost gains gotten by deceit.<br>
And look not for allies; I know indeed<br>
Such height of insolence was never reached<br>
Without abettors or accomplices;<br>
Thou hast some backer in thy bold essay,<br>
But I will search this matter home and see<br>

Why silent? Father, speak, nor turn away,<br>
Hast thou no word, wilt thou dismiss me then<br>
In mute disdain, nor tell me why thou art wrath?<br>
O ye his daughters, sisters mine, do ye<br>
This sullen, obstinate silence try to move.<br>
Let him not spurn, without a single word<br>
Of answer, me the suppliant of the god.<br>

<p class="drama">
POLYNEICES.<br>
Well dost thou counsel, and I will speak out.<br>
First will I call in aid the god himself,<br>
Poseidon, from whose altar I was raised,<br>
With warrant from the monarch of this land,<br>
To parley with you, and depart unscathed.<br>
These pledges, strangers, I would see observed<br>
By you and by my sisters and my sire.<br>
Now, father, let me tell thee why I came.<br>
I have been banished from my native land<br>
Because by right of primogeniture<br>
I claimed possession of thy sovereign throne<br>
Wherefrom Etocles, my younger brother,<br>
Ousted me, not by weight of precedent,<br>
Nor by the last arbitrament of war,<br>
But by his popular acts; and the prime cause<br>
Of this I deem the curse that rests on thee.<br>
So likewise hold the soothsayers, for when<br>
I came to Argos in the Dorian land<br>
And took the king Adrastus’ child to wife,<br>
Under my standard I enlisted all<br>
The foremost captains of the Apian isle,<br>
To levy with their aid that sevenfold host<br>
Of spearmen against Thebes, determining<br>
To oust my foes or die in a just cause.<br>
Why then, thou askest, am I here today?<br>
Father, I come a suppliant to thee<br>
Both for myself and my allies who now<br>
With squadrons seven beneath their seven spears<br>
Beleaguer all the plain that circles Thebes.<br>
Foremost the peerless warrior, peerless seer,<br>
Amphiaraiis with his lightning lance;<br>
Next an Aetolian, Tydeus, Oeneus’ son;<br>
Eteoclus of Argive birth the third;<br>
The fourth Hippomedon, sent to the war<br>
By his sire Talaos; Capaneus, the fifth,<br>
Vaunts he will fire and raze the town; the sixth<br>
Parthenopaeus, an Arcadian born<br>
Named of that maid, longtime a maid and late<br>
Espoused, Atalanta’s true-born child;<br>
Last I thy son, or thine at least in name,<br>
If but the bastard of an evil fate,<br>
Lead against Thebes the fearless Argive host.<br>
Thus by thy children and thy life, my sire,<br>
We all adjure thee to remit thy wrath<br>
And favor one who seeks a just revenge<br>
Against a brother who has banned and robbed him.<br>
For victory, if oracles speak true,<br>
Will fall to those who have thee for ally.<br>
So, by our fountains and familiar gods<br>
I pray thee, yield and hear; a beggar I<br>
And exile, thou an exile likewise; both<br>
Involved in one misfortune find a home<br>
As pensioners, while he, the lord of Thebes,<br>
O agony! makes a mock of thee and me.<br>
I’ll scatter with a breath the upstart’s might,<br>
And bring thee home again and stablish thee,<br>
And stablish, having cast him out, myself.<br>
This will thy goodwill I will undertake,<br>
Without it I can scare return alive.<br>

Nay, worthy seniors, but for Theseus’ sake<br>
Who sent him hither to have word of me.<br>
Never again would he have heard my voice;<br>
But now he shall obtain this parting grace,<br>
An answer that will bring him little joy.<br>
O villain, when thou hadst the sovereignty<br>
That now thy brother holdeth in thy stead,<br>
Didst thou not drive me, thine own father, out,<br>
An exile, cityless, and make we wear<br>
This beggar’s garb thou weepest to behold,<br>
Now thou art come thyself to my sad plight?<br>
Nothing is here for tears; it must be borne<br>
By <i>me</i> till death, and I shall think of thee<br>
As of my murderer; thou didst thrust me out;<br>
’Tis thou hast made me conversant with woe,<br>
Through thee I beg my bread in a strange land;<br>
And had not these my daughters tended me<br>
I had been dead for aught of aid from thee.<br>
They tend me, they preserve me, they are men<br>
Not women in true service to their sire;<br>
But ye are bastards, and no sons of mine.<br>
Therefore just Heaven hath an eye on thee;<br>
Howbeit not yet with aspect so austere<br>
As thou shalt soon experience, if indeed<br>
These banded hosts are moving against Thebes.<br>
That city thou canst never storm, but first<br>
Shall fall, thou and thy brother, blood-imbrued.<br>
Such curse I lately launched against you twain,<br>
Such curse I now invoke to fight for me,<br>
That ye may learn to honor those who bear thee<br>
Nor flout a sightless father who begat<br>
Degenerate sons—these maidens did not so.<br>
Therefore my curse is stronger than thy “throne,”<br>
Thy “suppliance,” if by right of laws eterne<br>
Primeval Justice sits enthroned with Zeus.<br>
Begone, abhorred, disowned, no son of mine,<br>
Thou vilest of the vile! and take with thee<br>
This curse I leave thee as my last bequest:—<br>
Never to win by arms thy native land,<br>
No, nor return to Argos in the Vale,<br>
But by a kinsman’s hand to die and slay<br>
Him who expelled thee. So I pray and call<br>
On the ancestral gloom of Tartarus<br>
To snatch thee hence, on these dread goddesses<br>
I call, and Ares who incensed you both<br>
To mortal enmity. Go now proclaim<br>
What thou hast heard to the Cadmeians all,<br>
Thy staunch confederates—this the heritage<br>
that Oedipus divideth to his sons.<br>

<p class="drama">
MESSENGER.<br>
Thy question hits the marvel of the tale.<br>
How he moved hence, you saw him and must know;<br>
Without a friend to lead the way, himself<br>
Guiding us all. So having reached the abrupt<br>
Earth-rooted Threshold with its brazen stairs,<br>
He paused at one of the converging paths,<br>
Hard by the rocky basin which records<br>
The pact of Theseus and Peirithous.<br>
Betwixt that rift and the Thorician rock,<br>
The hollow pear-tree and the marble tomb,<br>
Midway he sat and loosed his beggar’s weeds;<br>
Then calling to his daughters bade them fetch<br>
Of running water, both to wash withal<br>
And make libation; so they clomb the steep;<br>
And in brief space brought what their father bade,<br>
Then laved and dressed him with observance due.<br>
But when he had his will in everything,<br>
And no desire was left unsatisfied,<br>
It thundered from the netherworld; the maids<br>
Shivered, and crouching at their father’s knees<br>
Wept, beat their breast and uttered a long wail.<br>
He, as he heard their sudden bitter cry,<br>
Folded his arms about them both and said,<br>
“My children, ye will lose your sire today,<br>
For all of me has perished, and no more<br>
Have ye to bear your long, long ministry;<br>
A heavy load, I know, and yet one word<br>
Wipes out all score of tribulations—<i>love</i>.<br>
And love from me ye had—from no man more;<br>
But now must live without me all your days.”<br>
So clinging to each other sobbed and wept<br>
Father and daughters both, but when at last<br>
Their mourning had an end and no wail rose,<br>
A moment there was silence; suddenly<br>
A voice that summoned him; with sudden dread<br>
The hair of all stood up and all were ’mazed;<br>
For the call came, now loud, now low, and oft.<br>
“Oedipus, Oedipus, why tarry we?<br>
Too long, too long thy passing is delayed.”<br>
But when he heard the summons of the god,<br>
He prayed that Theseus might be brought, and when<br>
The Prince came nearer: “O my friend,” he cried,<br>
“Pledge ye my daughters, giving thy right hand—<br>
And, daughters, give him yours—and promise me<br>
Thou never wilt forsake them, but do all<br>
That time and friendship prompt in their behoof.”<br>
And he of his nobility repressed<br>
His tears and swore to be their constant friend.<br>
This promise given, Oedipus put forth<br>
Blind hands and laid them on his children, saying,<br>
“O children, prove your true nobility<br>
And hence depart nor seek to witness sights<br>
Unlawful or to hear unlawful words.<br>
Nay, go with speed; let none but Theseus stay,<br>
Our ruler, to behold what next shall hap.”<br>
So we all heard him speak, and weeping sore<br>
We companied the maidens on their way.<br>
After brief space we looked again, and lo<br>
The man was gone, evanished from our eyes;<br>
Only the king we saw with upraised hand<br>
Shading his eyes as from some awful sight,<br>
That no man might endure to look upon.<br>
A moment later, and we saw him bend<br>
In prayer to Earth and prayer to Heaven at once.<br>
But by what doom the stranger met his end<br>
No man save Theseus knoweth. For there fell<br>
No fiery bold that reft him in that hour,<br>
Nor whirlwind from the sea, but he was taken.<br>
It was a messenger from heaven, or else<br>
Some gentle, painless cleaving of earth’s base;<br>
For without wailing or disease or pain<br>
He passed away—and end most marvelous.<br>
And if to some my tale seems foolishness<br>
I am content that such could count me fool.<br>

<h3>ARGUMENT</h3>
<p>
Antigone, daughter of Oedipus, the late king of Thebes, in defiance of Creon
who rules in his stead, resolves to bury her brother Polyneices, slain in his
attack on Thebes. She is caught in the act by Creon’s watchmen and brought
before the king. She justifies her action, asserting that she was bound to obey
the eternal laws of right and wrong in spite of any human ordinance. Creon,
unrelenting, condemns her to be immured in a rock-hewn chamber. His son Haemon,
to whom Antigone is betrothed, pleads in vain for her life and threatens to die
with her. Warned by the seer Teiresias Creon repents him and hurries to release
Antigone from her rocky prison. But he is too late: he finds lying side by side
Antigone who had hanged herself and Haemon who also has perished by his own
hand. Returning to the palace he sees within the dead body of his queen who on
learning of her son’s death has stabbed herself to the heart.

<p class="noindent">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANTIGONE and ISMENE before the Palace gates.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
Ismene, sister of my blood and heart,<br>
See’st thou how Zeus would in our lives fulfill<br>
The weird of Oedipus, a world of woes!<br>
For what of pain, affliction, outrage, shame,<br>
Is lacking in our fortunes, thine and mine?<br>
And now this proclamation of today<br>
Made by our Captain-General to the State,<br>
What can its purport be? Didst hear and heed,<br>
Or art thou deaf when friends are banned as foes?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
To me, Antigone, no word of friends<br>
Has come, or glad or grievous, since we twain<br>
Were reft of our two brethren in one day<br>
By double fratricide; and since i’ the night<br>
Our Argive leaguers fled, no later news<br>
Has reached me, to inspirit or deject.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
I know ’twas so, and therefore summoned thee<br>
Beyond the gates to breathe it in thine ear.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
What is it? Some dark secret stirs thy breast.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
What but the thought of our two brothers dead,<br>
The one by Creon graced with funeral rites,<br>
The other disappointed? Eteocles<br>
He hath consigned to earth (as fame reports)<br>
With obsequies that use and wont ordain,<br>
So gracing him among the dead below.<br>
But Polyneices, a dishonored corse,<br>
(So by report the royal edict runs)<br>
No man may bury him or make lament—<br>
Must leave him tombless and unwept, a feast<br>
For kites to scent afar and swoop upon.<br>
Such is the edict (if report speak true)<br>
Of Creon, our most noble Creon, aimed<br>
At thee and me, aye me too; and anon<br>
He will be here to promulgate, for such<br>
As have not heard, his mandate; ’tis in sooth<br>
No passing humor, for the edict says<br>
Whoe’er transgresses shall be stoned to death.<br>
So stands it with us; now ’tis thine to show<br>
If thou art worthy of thy blood or base.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
But how, my rash, fond sister, in such case<br>
Can I do anything to make or mar?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
Say, wilt thou aid me and abet? Decide.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
In what bold venture? What is in thy thought?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
Lend me a hand to bear the corpse away.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
What, bury him despite the interdict?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
My brother, and, though thou deny him, thine<br>
No man shall say that <i>I</i> betrayed a brother.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
Wilt thou persist, though Creon has forbid?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
What right has he to keep me from my own?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
Bethink thee, sister, of our father’s fate,<br>
Abhorred, dishonored, self-convinced of sin,<br>
Blinded, himself his executioner.<br>
Think of his mother-wife (ill sorted names)<br>
Done by a noose herself had twined to death<br>
And last, our hapless brethren in one day,<br>
Both in a mutual destiny involved,<br>
Self-slaughtered, both the slayer and the slain.<br>
Bethink thee, sister, we are left alone;<br>
Shall we not perish wretchedest of all,<br>
If in defiance of the law we cross<br>
A monarch’s will?—weak women, think of that,<br>
Not framed by nature to contend with men.<br>
Remember this too that the stronger rules;<br>
We must obey his orders, these or worse.<br>
Therefore I plead compulsion and entreat<br>
The dead to pardon. I perforce obey<br>
The powers that be. ’Tis foolishness, I ween,<br>
To overstep in aught the golden mean.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
I urge no more; nay, wert thou willing still,<br>
I would not welcome such a fellowship.<br>
Go thine own way; myself will bury him.<br>
How sweet to die in such employ, to rest,—<br>
Sister and brother linked in love’s embrace—<br>
A sinless sinner, banned awhile on earth,<br>
But by the dead commended; and with them<br>
I shall abide for ever. As for thee,<br>
Scorn, if thou wilt, the eternal laws of Heaven.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
I scorn them not, but to defy the State<br>
Or break her ordinance I have no skill.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
A specious pretext. I will go alone<br>
To lap my dearest brother in the grave.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
My poor, fond sister, how I fear for thee!<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
O waste no fears on me; look to thyself.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
At least let no man know of thine intent,<br>
But keep it close and secret, as will I.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
O tell it, sister; I shall hate thee more<br>
If thou proclaim it not to all the town.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
Thou hast a fiery soul for numbing work.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
I pleasure those whom I would liefest please.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
If thou succeed; but thou art doomed to fail.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
When strength shall fail me, yes, but not before.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
But, if the venture’s hopeless, why essay?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
Sister, forbear, or I shall hate thee soon,<br>
And the dead man will hate thee too, with cause.<br>
Say I am mad and give my madness rein<br>
To wreck itself; the worst that can befall<br>
Is but to die an honorable death.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ISMENE.<br>
Have thine own way then; ’tis a mad endeavor,<br>
Yet to thy lovers thou art dear as ever.<br>
[Exeunt]<br>

<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
(Str. 1)<br>
Sunbeam, of all that ever dawn upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our seven-gated Thebes the brightest ray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O eye of golden day,<br>
How fair thy light o’er Dirce’s fountain shone,<br>
Speeding upon their headlong homeward course,<br>
Far quicker than they came, the Argive force;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting to flight<br>
The argent shields, the host with scutcheons white.<br>
Against our land the proud invader came<br>
To vindicate fell Polyneices’ claim.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like to an eagle swooping low,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On pinions white as new fall’n snow.<br>
With clanging scream, a horsetail plume his crest,<br>
The aspiring lord of Argos onward pressed.<br>
<br>
(Ant. 1)<br>
Hovering around our city walls he waits,<br>
His spearmen raven at our seven gates.<br>
But ere a torch our crown of towers could burn,<br>
Ere they had tasted of our blood, they turn<br>
Forced by the Dragon; in their rear<br>
The din of Ares panic-struck they hear.<br>
For Zeus who hates the braggart’s boast<br>
Beheld that gold-bespangled host;<br>
As at the goal the paean they upraise,<br>
He struck them with his forked lightning blaze.<br>
<br>
(Str. 2)<br>
To earthy from earth rebounding, down he crashed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire-brand from his impious hand was dashed,<br>
As like a Bacchic reveler on he came,<br>
Outbreathing hate and flame,<br>
And tottered. Elsewhere in the field,<br>
Here, there, great Area like a war-horse wheeled;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath his car down thrust<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our foemen bit the dust.<br>
<br>
Seven captains at our seven gates<br>
Thundered; for each a champion waits,<br>
Each left behind his armor bright,<br>
Trophy for Zeus who turns the fight;<br>
Save two alone, that ill-starred pair<br>
One mother to one father bare,<br>
Who lance in rest, one ’gainst the other<br>
Drave, and both perished, brother slain by brother.<br>
<br>
(Ant. 2)<br>
Now Victory to Thebes returns again<br>
And smiles upon her chariot-circled plain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let feast and festal should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memories of war blot out.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us to the temples throng,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dance and sing the live night long.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God of Thebes, lead thou the round.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bacchus, shaker of the ground!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us end our revels here;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! Creon our new lord draws near,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowned by this strange chance, our king.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, I marvel, pondering?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why this summons? Wherefore call<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Us, his elders, one and all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bidding us with him debate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On some grave concern of State?<br>
[Enter CREON]<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Elders, the gods have righted one again<br>
Our storm-tossed ship of state, now safe in port.<br>
But you by special summons I convened<br>
As my most trusted councilors; first, because<br>
I knew you loyal to Laius of old;<br>
Again, when Oedipus restored our State,<br>
Both while he ruled and when his rule was o’er,<br>
Ye still were constant to the royal line.<br>
Now that his two sons perished in one day,<br>
Brother by brother murderously slain,<br>
By right of kinship to the Princes dead,<br>
I claim and hold the throne and sovereignty.<br>
Yet ’tis no easy matter to discern<br>
The temper of a man, his mind and will,<br>
Till he be proved by exercise of power;<br>
And in my case, if one who reigns supreme<br>
Swerve from the highest policy, tongue-tied<br>
By fear of consequence, that man I hold,<br>
And ever held, the basest of the base.<br>
And I contemn the man who sets his friend<br>
Before his country. For myself, I call<br>
To witness Zeus, whose eyes are everywhere,<br>
If I perceive some mischievous design<br>
To sap the State, I will not hold my tongue;<br>
Nor would I reckon as my private friend<br>
A public foe, well knowing that the State<br>
Is the good ship that holds our fortunes all:<br>
Farewell to friendship, if she suffers wreck.<br>
Such is the policy by which I seek<br>
To serve the Commons and conformably<br>
I have proclaimed an edict as concerns<br>
The sons of Oedipus; Eteocles<br>
Who in his country’s battle fought and fell,<br>
The foremost champion—duly bury him<br>
With all observances and ceremonies<br>
That are the guerdon of the heroic dead.<br>
But for the miscreant exile who returned<br>
Minded in flames and ashes to blot out<br>
His father’s city and his father’s gods,<br>
And glut his vengeance with his kinsmen’s blood,<br>
Or drag them captive at his chariot wheels—<br>
For Polyneices ’tis ordained that none<br>
Shall give him burial or make mourn for him,<br>
But leave his corpse unburied, to be meat<br>
For dogs and carrion crows, a ghastly sight.<br>
So am I purposed; never by my will<br>
Shall miscreants take precedence of true men,<br>
But all good patriots, alive or dead,<br>
Shall be by me preferred and honored.<br>

<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
Son of Menoeceus, thus thou will’st to deal<br>

My lord, I will not make pretense to pant<br>

In sooth my soul beneath its pack of thought<br>

“Why hurry headlong to thy fate, poor fool?”<br>
She whispered. Then again, “If Creon learn<br>
This from another, thou wilt rue it worse.”<br>
Thus leisurely I hastened on my road;<br>
Much thought extends a furlong to a league.<br>
But in the end the forward voice prevailed,<br>
To face thee. I will speak though I say nothing.<br>
For plucking courage from despair methought,<br>
‘Let the worst hap, thou canst but meet thy fate.’<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
What is thy news? Why this despondency?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
GUARD.<br>
Let me premise a word about myself?<br>
I neither did the deed nor saw it done,<br>
Nor were it just that I should come to harm.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Thou art good at parry, and canst fence about<br>
Some matter of grave import, as is plain.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
GUARD.<br>
The bearer of dread tidings needs must quake.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Then, sirrah, shoot thy bolt and get thee gone.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
GUARD.<br>
Well, it must out; the corpse is buried; someone<br>
E’en now besprinkled it with thirsty dust,<br>
Performed the proper ritual—and was gone.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
What say’st thou? Who hath dared to do this thing?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
GUARD.<br>
I cannot tell, for there was ne’er a trace<br>
Of pick or mattock—hard unbroken ground,<br>
Without a scratch or rut of chariot wheels,<br>
No sign that human hands had been at work.<br>
When the first sentry of the morning watch<br>
Gave the alarm, we all were terror-stricken.<br>
The corpse had vanished, not interred in earth,<br>
But strewn with dust, as if by one who sought<br>
To avert the curse that haunts the unburied dead:<br>
Of hound or ravening jackal, not a sign.<br>
Thereat arose an angry war of words;<br>
Guard railed at guard and blows were like to end it,<br>
For none was there to part us, each in turn<br>
Suspected, but the guilt brought home to none,<br>
From lack of evidence. We challenged each<br>
The ordeal, or to handle red-hot iron,<br>
Or pass through fire, affirming on our oath<br>
Our innocence—we neither did the deed<br>
Ourselves, nor know who did or compassed it.<br>
Our quest was at a standstill, when one spake<br>
And bowed us all to earth like quivering reeds,<br>
For there was no gainsaying him nor way<br>
To escape perdition: <i>Ye</i>are<i>bound</i>to<i>tell</i><br>
<i>The</i>King,<i>ye</i>cannot<i>hide</i>it; so he spake.<br>
And he convinced us all; so lots were cast,<br>
And I, unlucky scapegoat, drew the prize.<br>
So here I am unwilling and withal<br>
Unwelcome; no man cares to hear ill news.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
I had misgivings from the first, my liege,<br>
Of something more than natural at work.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
O cease, you vex me with your babblement;<br>
I am like to think you dote in your old age.<br>
Is it not arrant folly to pretend<br>
That gods would have a thought for this dead man?<br>
Did they forsooth award him special grace,<br>
And as some benefactor bury him,<br>
Who came to fire their hallowed sanctuaries,<br>
To sack their shrines, to desolate their land,<br>
And scout their ordinances? Or perchance<br>
The gods bestow their favors on the bad.<br>
No! no! I have long noted malcontents<br>
Who wagged their heads, and kicked against the yoke,<br>
Misliking these my orders, and my rule.<br>
’Tis they, I warrant, who suborned my guards<br>
By bribes. Of evils current upon earth<br>
The worst is money. Money ’tis that sacks<br>
Cities, and drives men forth from hearth and home;<br>
Warps and seduces native innocence,<br>
And breeds a habit of dishonesty.<br>
But they who sold themselves shall find their greed<br>
Out-shot the mark, and rue it soon or late.<br>
Yea, as I still revere the dread of Zeus,<br>
By Zeus I swear, except ye find and bring<br>
Before my presence here the very man<br>
Who carried out this lawless burial,<br>
Death for your punishment shall not suffice.<br>
Hanged on a cross, alive ye first shall make<br>
Confession of this outrage. This will teach you<br>
What practices are like to serve your turn.<br>
There are some villainies that bring no gain.<br>
For by dishonesty the few may thrive,<br>
The many come to ruin and disgrace.<br>

CHORUS.<br>
(Str. 1)<br>
Many wonders there be, but naught more wondrous than man;<br>
Over the surging sea, with a whitening south wind wan,<br>
Through the foam of the firth, man makes his perilous way;<br>
And the eldest of deities Earth that knows not toil nor decay<br>
Ever he furrows and scores, as his team, year in year out,<br>
With breed of the yoked horse, the ploughshare turneth about.<br>
<br>
(Ant. 1)<br>
The light-witted birds of the air, the beasts of the weald and the wood<br>
He traps with his woven snare, and the brood of the briny flood.<br>
Master of cunning he: the savage bull, and the hart<br>
Who roams the mountain free, are tamed by his infinite art;<br>
And the shaggy rough-maned steed is broken to bear the bit.<br>
<br>
(Str. 2)<br>
Speech and the wind-swift speed of counsel and civic wit,<br>
He hath learnt for himself all these; and the arrowy rain to fly<br>
And the nipping airs that freeze, ’neath the open winter sky.<br>
He hath provision for all: fell plague he hath learnt to endure;<br>
Safe whate’er may befall: yet for death he hath found no cure.<br>
<br>
(Ant. 2)<br>
Passing the wildest flight thought are the cunning and skill,<br>
That guide man now to the light, but now to counsels of ill.<br>
If he honors the laws of the land, and reveres the Gods of the State<br>
Proudly his city shall stand; but a cityless outcast I rate<br>
Whoso bold in his pride from the path of right doth depart;<br>
Ne’er may I sit by his side, or share the thoughts of his heart.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What strange vision meets my eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fills me with a wild surprise?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure I know her, sure ’tis she,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid Antigone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hapless child of hapless sire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Didst thou recklessly conspire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madly brave the King’s decree?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore are they haling thee?<br>

<p class="drama">
GUARD.<br>
Here is the culprit taken in the act<br>
Of giving burial. But where’s the King?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
There from the palace he returns in time.<br>
[Enter CREON]<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Why is my presence timely? What has chanced?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
GUARD.<br>
No man, my lord, should make a vow, for if<br>
He ever swears he will not do a thing,<br>
His afterthoughts belie his first resolve.<br>
When from the hail-storm of thy threats I fled<br>
I sware thou wouldst not see me here again;<br>
But the wild rapture of a glad surprise<br>
Intoxicates, and so I’m here forsworn.<br>
And here’s my prisoner, caught in the very act,<br>
Decking the grave. No lottery this time;<br>
This prize is mine by right of treasure-trove.<br>
So take her, judge her, rack her, if thou wilt.<br>
She’s thine, my liege; but I may rightly claim<br>
Hence to depart well quit of all these ills.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Say, how didst thou arrest the maid, and where?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
GUARD.<br>
Burying the man. There’s nothing more to tell.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Hast thou thy wits? Or know’st thou what thou say’st?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
GUARD.<br>
I saw this woman burying the corpse<br>
Against thy orders. Is that clear and plain?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
But how was she surprised and caught in the act?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
GUARD.<br>
It happened thus. No sooner had we come,<br>
Driven from thy presence by those awful threats,<br>
Than straight we swept away all trace of dust,<br>
And bared the clammy body. Then we sat<br>
High on the ridge to windward of the stench,<br>
While each man kept he fellow alert and rated<br>
Roundly the sluggard if he chanced to nap.<br>
So all night long we watched, until the sun<br>
Stood high in heaven, and his blazing beams<br>
Smote us. A sudden whirlwind then upraised<br>
A cloud of dust that blotted out the sky,<br>
And swept the plain, and stripped the woodlands bare,<br>
And shook the firmament. We closed our eyes<br>
And waited till the heaven-sent plague should pass.<br>
At last it ceased, and lo! there stood this maid.<br>
A piercing cry she uttered, sad and shrill,<br>
As when the mother bird beholds her nest<br>
Robbed of its nestlings; even so the maid<br>
Wailed as she saw the body stripped and bare,<br>
And cursed the ruffians who had done this deed.<br>
Anon she gathered handfuls of dry dust,<br>
Then, holding high a well-wrought brazen urn,<br>
Thrice on the dead she poured a lustral stream.<br>
We at the sight swooped down on her and seized<br>
Our quarry. Undismayed she stood, and when<br>
We taxed her with the former crime and this,<br>
She disowned nothing. I was glad—and grieved;<br>
For ’tis most sweet to ’scape oneself scot-free,<br>
And yet to bring disaster to a friend<br>
Is grievous. Take it all in all, I deem<br>
A man’s first duty is to serve himself.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Speak, girl, with head bent low and downcast eyes,<br>
Does thou plead guilty or deny the deed?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
Guilty. I did it, I deny it not.<br>
<br>
CREON (to GUARD)<br>
Sirrah, begone whither thou wilt, and thank<br>
Thy luck that thou hast ’scaped a heavy charge.<br>
(To ANTIGONE)<br>
Now answer this plain question, yes or no,<br>
Wast thou acquainted with the interdict?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
I knew, all knew; how should I fail to know?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
And yet wert bold enough to break the law?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
ANTIGONE.<br>
Yea, for these laws were not ordained of Zeus,<br>
And she who sits enthroned with gods below,<br>
Justice, enacted not these human laws.<br>
Nor did I deem that thou, a mortal man,<br>
Could’st by a breath annul and override<br>
The immutable unwritten laws of Heaven.<br>
They were not born today nor yesterday;<br>
They die not; and none knoweth whence they sprang.<br>
I was not like, who feared no mortal’s frown,<br>
To disobey these laws and so provoke<br>
The wrath of Heaven. I knew that I must die,<br>
E’en hadst thou not proclaimed it; and if death<br>
Is thereby hastened, I shall count it gain.<br>
For death is gain to him whose life, like mine,<br>
Is full of misery. Thus my lot appears<br>
Not sad, but blissful; for had I endured<br>
To leave my mother’s son unburied there,<br>
I should have grieved with reason, but not now.<br>
And if in this thou judgest me a fool,<br>
Methinks the judge of folly’s not acquit.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
A stubborn daughter of a stubborn sire,<br>
This ill-starred maiden kicks against the pricks.<br>

<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Well, let her know the stubbornest of wills<br>
Are soonest bended, as the hardest iron,<br>
O’er-heated in the fire to brittleness,<br>
Flies soonest into fragments, shivered through.<br>
A snaffle curbs the fieriest steed, and he<br>
Who in subjection lives must needs be meek.<br>
But this proud girl, in insolence well-schooled,<br>
First overstepped the established law, and then—<br>
A second and worse act of insolence—<br>
She boasts and glories in her wickedness.<br>
Now if she thus can flout authority<br>
Unpunished, I am woman, she the man.<br>
But though she be my sister’s child or nearer<br>
Of kin than all who worship at my hearth,<br>
Nor she nor yet her sister shall escape<br>
The utmost penalty, for both I hold,<br>
As arch-conspirators, of equal guilt.<br>
Bring forth the older; even now I saw her<br>
Within the palace, frenzied and distraught.<br>
The workings of the mind discover oft<br>
Dark deeds in darkness schemed, before the act.<br>
More hateful still the miscreant who seeks<br>
When caught, to make a virtue of a crime.<br>

Is pleasant: God forbid it e’er should please;<br>
Nor am I more acceptable to thee.<br>
And yet how otherwise had I achieved<br>
A name so glorious as by burying<br>
A brother? so my townsmen all would say,<br>
Where they not gagged by terror, Manifold<br>
A king’s prerogatives, and not the least<br>
That all his acts and all his words are law.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it for his bride he’s grieved,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or her marriage-bed deceived,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doth he make his mourn for thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maid forlorn, Antigone?<br>
[Enter HAEMON]<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Soon shall we know, better than seer can tell.<br>
Learning may fixed decree anent thy bride,<br>
Thou mean’st not, son, to rave against thy sire?<br>
Know’st not whate’er we do is done in love?<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
HAEMON.<br>
O father, I am thine, and I will take<br>
Thy wisdom as the helm to steer withal.<br>
Therefore no wedlock shall by me be held<br>
More precious than thy loving goverance.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Well spoken: so right-minded sons should feel,<br>
In all deferring to a father’s will.<br>
For ’tis the hope of parents they may rear<br>
A brood of sons submissive, keen to avenge<br>
Their father’s wrongs, and count his friends their own.<br>
But who begets unprofitable sons,<br>
He verily breeds trouble for himself,<br>
And for his foes much laughter. Son, be warned<br>
And let no woman fool away thy wits.<br>
Ill fares the husband mated with a shrew,<br>
And her embraces very soon wax cold.<br>
For what can wound so surely to the quick<br>
As a false friend? So spue and cast her off,<br>
Bid her go find a husband with the dead.<br>
For since I caught her openly rebelling,<br>
Of all my subjects the one malcontent,<br>
I will not prove a traitor to the State.<br>
She surely dies. Go, let her, if she will,<br>
Appeal to Zeus the God of Kindred, for<br>
If thus I nurse rebellion in my house,<br>
Shall not I foster mutiny without?<br>
For whoso rules his household worthily,<br>
Will prove in civic matters no less wise.<br>
But he who overbears the laws, or thinks<br>
To overrule his rulers, such as one<br>
I never will allow. Whome’er the State<br>
Appoints must be obeyed in everything,<br>
But small and great, just and unjust alike.<br>
I warrant such a one in either case<br>
Would shine, as King or subject; such a man<br>
Would in the storm of battle stand his ground,<br>
A comrade leal and true; but Anarchy—<br>
What evils are not wrought by Anarchy!<br>
She ruins States, and overthrows the home,<br>
She dissipates and routs the embattled host;<br>
While discipline preserves the ordered ranks.<br>
Therefore we must maintain authority<br>
And yield to title to a woman’s will.<br>
Better, if needs be, men should cast us out<br>
Than hear it said, a woman proved his match.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
To me, unless old age have dulled wits,<br>
Thy words appear both reasonable and wise.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
HAEMON.<br>
Father, the gods implant in mortal men<br>
Reason, the choicest gift bestowed by heaven.<br>
’Tis not for me to say thou errest, nor<br>
Would I arraign thy wisdom, if I could;<br>
And yet wise thoughts may come to other men<br>
And, as thy son, it falls to me to mark<br>
The acts, the words, the comments of the crowd.<br>
The commons stand in terror of thy frown,<br>
And dare not utter aught that might offend,<br>
But I can overhear their muttered plaints,<br>
Know how the people mourn this maiden doomed<br>
For noblest deeds to die the worst of deaths.<br>
When her own brother slain in battle lay<br>
Unsepulchered, she suffered not his corse<br>
To lie for carrion birds and dogs to maul:<br>
Should not her name (they cry) be writ in gold?<br>
Such the low murmurings that reach my ear.<br>
O father, nothing is by me more prized<br>
Than thy well-being, for what higher good<br>
Can children covet than their sire’s fair fame,<br>
As fathers too take pride in glorious sons?<br>
Therefore, my father, cling not to one mood,<br>
And deemed not thou art right, all others wrong.<br>
For whoso thinks that wisdom dwells with him,<br>
That he alone can speak or think aright,<br>
Such oracles are empty breath when tried.<br>
The wisest man will let himself be swayed<br>
By others’ wisdom and relax in time.<br>
See how the trees beside a stream in flood<br>
Save, if they yield to force, each spray unharmed,<br>
But by resisting perish root and branch.<br>
The mariner who keeps his mainsheet taut,<br>
And will not slacken in the gale, is like<br>
To sail with thwarts reversed, keel uppermost.<br>
Relent then and repent thee of thy wrath;<br>
For, if one young in years may claim some sense,<br>
I’ll say ’tis best of all to be endowed<br>
With absolute wisdom; but, if that’s denied,<br>
(And nature takes not readily that ply)<br>
Next wise is he who lists to sage advice.<br>

Gall-bladders cracked and spurted up: the fat<br>
Melted and fell and left the thigh bones bare.<br>
Such are the signs, taught by this lad, I read—<br>
As I guide others, so the boy guides me—<br>
The frustrate signs of oracles grown dumb.<br>
O King, thy willful temper ails the State,<br>
For all our shrines and altars are profaned<br>
By what has filled the maw of dogs and crows,<br>
The flesh of Oedipus’ unburied son.<br>
Therefore the angry gods abominate<br>
Our litanies and our burnt offerings;<br>
Therefore no birds trill out a happy note,<br>
Gorged with the carnival of human gore.<br>
O ponder this, my son. To err is common<br>
To all men, but the man who having erred<br>
Hugs not his errors, but repents and seeks<br>
The cure, is not a wastrel nor unwise.<br>
No fool, the saw goes, like the obstinate fool.<br>
Let death disarm thy vengeance. O forbear<br>
To vex the dead. What glory wilt thou win<br>
By slaying twice the slain? I mean thee well;<br>
Counsel’s most welcome if I promise gain.<br>

<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
Old man, ye all let fly at me your shafts<br>
Like anchors at a target; yea, ye set<br>
Your soothsayer on me. Peddlers are ye all<br>
And I the merchandise ye buy and sell.<br>
Go to, and make your profit where ye will,<br>
Silver of Sardis change for gold of Ind;<br>
Ye will not purchase this man’s burial,<br>
Not though the winged ministers of Zeus<br>
Should bear him in their talons to his throne;<br>
Not e’en in awe of prodigy so dire<br>
Would I permit his burial, for I know<br>
No human soilure can assail the gods;<br>
This too I know, Teiresias, dire’s the fall<br>
Of craft and cunning when it tries to gloss<br>
Foul treachery with fair words for filthy gain.<br>

Know then for sure, the coursers of the sun<br>

Thou shalt have given the fruit of thine own loins<br>
In quittance of thy murder, life for life;<br>
For that thou hast entombed a living soul,<br>
And sent below a denizen of earth,<br>
And wronged the nether gods by leaving here<br>
A corpse unlaved, unwept, unsepulchered.<br>
Herein thou hast no part, nor e’en the gods<br>
In heaven; and thou usurp’st a power not thine.<br>
For this the avenging spirits of Heaven and Hell<br>
Who dog the steps of sin are on thy trail:<br>
What these have suffered thou shalt suffer too.<br>
And now, consider whether bought by gold<br>
I prophesy. For, yet a little while,<br>
And sound of lamentation shall be heard,<br>
Of men and women through thy desolate halls;<br>
And all thy neighbor States are leagues to avenge<br>
Their mangled warriors who have found a grave<br>
I’ the maw of wolf or hound, or winged bird<br>
That flying homewards taints their city’s air.<br>
These are the shafts, that like a bowman I<br>
Provoked to anger, loosen at thy breast,<br>
Unerring, and their smart thou shalt not shun.<br>
Boy, lead me home, that he may vent his spleen<br>
On younger men, and learn to curb his tongue<br>
With gentler manners than his present mood.<br>

Where Ismenus rolls his waters,<br>

To thee, and to thy Mother levin-stricken,<br>

<p class="drama">
MESSENGER.<br>
Attend all ye who dwell beside the halls<br>
Of Cadmus and Amphion. No man’s life<br>
As of one tenor would I praise or blame,<br>
For Fortune with a constant ebb and rise<br>
Casts down and raises high and low alike,<br>
And none can read a mortal’s horoscope.<br>
Take Creon; he, methought, if any man,<br>
Was enviable. He had saved this land<br>
Of Cadmus from our enemies and attained<br>
A monarch’s powers and ruled the state supreme,<br>
While a right noble issue crowned his bliss.<br>
Now all is gone and wasted, for a life<br>
Without life’s joys I count a living death.<br>
You’ll tell me he has ample store of wealth,<br>
The pomp and circumstance of kings; but if<br>
These give no pleasure, all the rest I count<br>
The shadow of a shade, nor would I weigh<br>
His wealth and power ’gainst a dram of joy.<br>

<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
Lo! from the palace gates I see approaching<br>
Creon’s unhappy wife, Eurydice.<br>
Comes she by chance or learning her son’s fate?<br>
[Enter EURYDICE]<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
EURYDICE<br>
Ye men of Thebes, I overheard your talk.<br>
As I passed out to offer up my prayer<br>
To Pallas, and was drawing back the bar<br>
To open wide the door, upon my ears<br>
There broke a wail that told of household woe<br>
Stricken with terror in my handmaids’ arms<br>
I fell and fainted. But repeat your tale<br>
To one not unacquaint with misery.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
MESSENGER.<br>
Dear mistress, I was there and will relate<br>
The perfect truth, omitting not one word.<br>
Why should we gloze and flatter, to be proved<br>
Liars hereafter? Truth is ever best.<br>
Well, in attendance on my liege, your lord,<br>
I crossed the plain to its utmost margin, where<br>
The corse of Polyneices, gnawn and mauled,<br>
Was lying yet. We offered first a prayer<br>
To Pluto and the goddess of cross-ways,<br>
With contrite hearts, to deprecate their ire.<br>
Then laved with lustral waves the mangled corse,<br>
Laid it on fresh-lopped branches, lit a pyre,<br>
And to his memory piled a mighty mound<br>
Of mother earth. Then to the caverned rock,<br>
The bridal chamber of the maid and Death,<br>
We sped, about to enter. But a guard<br>
Heard from that godless shrine a far shrill wail,<br>
And ran back to our lord to tell the news.<br>
But as he nearer drew a hollow sound<br>
Of lamentation to the King was borne.<br>
He groaned and uttered then this bitter plaint:<br>
“Am I a prophet? miserable me!<br>
Is this the saddest path I ever trod?<br>
’Tis my son’s voice that calls me. On press on,<br>
My henchmen, haste with double speed to the tomb<br>
Where rocks down-torn have made a gap, look in<br>
And tell me if in truth I recognize<br>
The voice of Haemon or am heaven-deceived.”<br>
So at the bidding of our distraught lord<br>
We looked, and in the craven’s vaulted gloom<br>
I saw the maiden lying strangled there,<br>
A noose of linen twined about her neck;<br>
And hard beside her, clasping her cold form,<br>
Her lover lay bewailing his dead bride<br>
Death-wedded, and his father’s cruelty.<br>
When the King saw him, with a terrible groan<br>
He moved towards him, crying, “O my son<br>
What hast thou done? What ailed thee? What mischance<br>
Has reft thee of thy reason? O come forth,<br>
Come forth, my son; thy father supplicates.”<br>
But the son glared at him with tiger eyes,<br>
Spat in his face, and then, without a word,<br>
Drew his two-hilted sword and smote, but missed<br>
His father flying backwards. Then the boy,<br>
Wroth with himself, poor wretch, incontinent<br>
Fell on his sword and drove it through his side<br>
Home, but yet breathing clasped in his lax arms<br>
The maid, her pallid cheek incarnadined<br>
With his expiring gasps. So there they lay<br>
Two corpses, one in death. His marriage rites<br>
Are consummated in the halls of Death:<br>
A witness that of ills whate’er befall<br>
Mortals’ unwisdom is the worst of all.<br>
[Exit EURYDICE]<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
What makest thou of this? The Queen has gone<br>
Without a word importing good or ill.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
MESSENGER.<br>
I marvel too, but entertain good hope.<br>
’Tis that she shrinks in public to lament<br>
Her son’s sad ending, and in privacy<br>
Would with her maidens mourn a private loss.<br>
Trust me, she is discreet and will not err.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
I know not, but strained silence, so I deem,<br>
Is no less ominous than excessive grief.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
MESSENGER.<br>
Well, let us to the house and solve our doubts,<br>
Whether the tumult of her heart conceals<br>
Some fell design. It may be thou art right:<br>
Unnatural silence signifies no good.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! the King himself appears.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence he with him bears<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’Gainst himself (ah me! I quake<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’Gainst a king such charge to make)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all must own,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guilt is his and his alone.<br>

CREON.<br>
(Str. 1)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe for sin of minds perverse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deadly fraught with mortal curse.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold us slain and slayers, all akin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woe for my counsel dire, conceived in sin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, my son,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life scarce begun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wast undone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fault was mine, mine only, O my son!<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CHORUS.<br>
Too late thou seemest to perceive the truth.<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
CREON.<br>
(Str. 2)<br>
By sorrow schooled. Heavy the hand of God,<br>
Thorny and rough the paths my feet have trod,<br>
Humbled my pride, my pleasure turned to pain;<br>
Poor mortals, how we labor all in vain!<br>
[Enter SECOND MESSENGER]<br>
</p>
<p class="drama">
SECOND MESSENGER.<br>
Sorrows are thine, my lord, and more to come,<br>
One lying at thy feet, another yet<br>
More grievous waits thee, when thou comest home.<br>

CREON.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this word he saith,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woeful messenger? Say, is it fit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To slay anew a man already slain?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Death at work again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stroke upon stroke, first son, then mother slain?<br>

Unhappy mother, most unhappy son!<br>

SECOND MESSENGER.<br>
Beside the altar on a keen-edged sword<br>
She fell and closed her eyes in night, but erst<br>
She mourned for Megareus who nobly died<br>
Long since, then for her son; with her last breath<br>
She cursed thee, the slayer of her child.<br>

CREON.<br>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
