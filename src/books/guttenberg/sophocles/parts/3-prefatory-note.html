<h2>PREFATORY NOTE TO THE EDITION OF 1883</h2>
<p>I. The Hellenic spirit has been repeatedly characterized
as simple Nature-worship. Even the Higher
Paganism has been described as ‘in other words the
purified worship of natural forms.’<a class="fnref pginternal" href="#Pref2_fn_1">[1]</a> One might suppose,
in reading some modern writers, that the Nymphs
and Fauns, the River-Gods and Pan, were at least as
prominent in all Greek poetry as Zeus, Apollo, and
Athena, or that Apollo was only the sweet singer and
not also the prophet of retribution.</p>
<p>The fresh and unimpaired enjoyment of the Beautiful
is certainly the aspect of ancient life and literature
which most attracted the humanists of the sixteenth
century, and still most impresses those amongst ourselves
who for various reasons desire to point the contrast
between Paganism and Judaism. The two great
groups of forces vaguely known as the Renaissance and
the Revolution have both contributed to this result.
Men who were weary of conventionality and of the
weight of custom ‘heavy as frost and deep almost as
life,’ have longed for the vision of ‘Oread or Dryad
glancing through the shade,’ or to ‘hear old Triton
blow his wreathèd horn.’ Meanwhile, that in which the
Greeks most resembled us, ‘the human heart by which
we live,’ for the very reason that it lies so near to us,
is too apt to be lost from our conception of them.
Another cause of this one-sided view is the illusion produced
by the contemplation of statuary, together with
the unapproachable perfection of form which every relic
of Greek antiquity indisputably possesses.</p>
<p><span class="page2">[page xiv]</span>
But on turning from the forms of Greek art to the
substance of Greek literature, we find that Beauty,
although everywhere an important element, is by no
means the sole or even the chief attribute of the greatest
writings, nor is the Hellenic consciousness confined
within the life of Nature, unless this term is allowed to
comprehend man with all his thoughts and aspirations.
It was in this latter sense that Hegel recognized the
union of depth with brightness in Greek culture: ‘If
the first paradise was the paradise of nature, this is the
second, the higher paradise of the human spirit, which
in its fair naturalness, freedom, depth and brightness
here comes forth like a bride out of her chamber. The
first wild majesty of the rise of spiritual life in the East
is here circumscribed by the dignity of form, and softened
into beauty. Its depth shows itself no longer in confusion,
obscurity, and inflation, but lies open before us
in simple clearness. Its brightness (Heiterkeit) is not
a childish play, but covers a sadness which knows the
baldness of fate but is not by that knowledge driven out
of freedom and measure.’ Hegel’s Werke, vol. XVI.
p. 139 (translated by Prof. Caird). The simplicity of
Herodotus, for example, does not exclude far reaching
thoughts on the political advantages of liberty, nor such
reflections on experience as are implied in the saying
of Artabanus, that the transitoriness of human life is
the least of its evils. And in what modern writing is
more of the wisdom of life condensed than in the History
of Thucydides? It is surely more true to say of Greek
literature that it contains types of all things human,
stamped with the freshness, simplicity, and directness
which belong to first impressions, and to the first impressions
of genius.</p>
<p>Now the ‘thoughts and aspirations,’ which are nowhere
absent from Greek literature, and make a centre
of growing warmth and light in its Periclean period—when
the conception of human nature for the first time
takes definite shape—have no less of Religion in them
than underlay the ‘creed outworn’. To think otherwise
would be an error of the same kind as that ‘abuse
<span class="page2">[page xv]</span>
of the word Atheism’ against which the author of the
work above alluded to protests so forcibly.</p>
<p>Religion, in the sense here indicated, is the mainspring
and vital principle of Tragedy. The efforts of
Aeschylus and Sophocles were sustained by it, and its
inevitable decay through the scepticism which preceded
Socrates was the chief hindrance to the tragic genius of
Euripides. Yet the inequality of which we have consequently
to complain in him is redeemed by pregnant
hints of something yet ‘more deeply interfused,’ which
in him, as in his two great predecessors, is sometimes
felt as ‘modern,’ because it is not of an age but for all
time. The most valuable part of every literature is
something which transcends the period and nation out
of which it springs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, much that at first sight seems
primitive in Greek tragedy belongs more to the subject
than to the mode of handling. The age of Pericles was
in advance of that in which the legends were first
Hellenized and humanized, just as this must have been
already far removed from the earliest stages of mythopoeic
imagination. The reader of Aeschylus or Sophocles
should therefore be warned against attributing to
the poet’s invention that which is given in the fable.</p>
<p>An educated student of Italian painting knows how
to discriminate—say in an Assumption by Botticelli—between
the traditional conventions, the contemporary
ideas, and the refinements of the artist’s own fancy.
The same indulgence must be extended to dramatic art.
The tragedy of King Lear is not rude or primitive,
although the subject belongs to prehistoric times in
Britain. Nor is Goethe’s Faust mediaeval in spirit as
in theme. So neither is the Oedipus Rex the product
of ‘lawless and uncertain thoughts,’ notwithstanding
the unspeakable horror of the story, but is penetrated
by the most profound estimate of all in human life that
is saddest, and all that is most precious.</p>
<p>Far from being naive naturalists after the Keats
<span class="page2">[page xvi]</span>
fashion, the Greek tragic poets had succeeded to a
pessimistic reaction from simple Pagan enjoyment; they
were surrounded with gloomy questionings about human
destiny and Divine Justice, and they replied by looking
steadily at the facts of life and asserting the supreme
worth of innocence, equity, and mercy.</p>
<p>They were not philosophers, for they spoke the language
of feeling; but the civilization of which they
were the strongest outcome was already tinged with
influences derived from early philosophy—especially
from the gnomic wisdom of the sixth century and from
the spirit of theosophic speculation, which in Aeschylus
goes far even to recast mythology. The latter influence
was probably reinforced, through channels no longer
traceable, by the Eleusinian worship, in which the
mystery of life and death and of human sorrow had
replaced the primitive wonder at the phenomena of the
year.</p>
<p>And whatever elements of philosophic theory or
mystic exaltation the drama may have reflected, it was
still more emphatically the repository of some of the
most precious traditions of civilized humanity—traditions
which philosophy has sometimes tended to extenuate,
if not to destroy.</p>
<p>Plato’s Gorgias contains one of the most eloquent
vindications of the transcendent value of righteousness
and faithfulness as such. But when we ask, ‘Righteousness
in what relation?’—‘Faithfulness to whom?’—the
Gorgias is silent; and when the vacant outline is
filled up in the Republic, we are presented with an ideal
of man’s social relations, which, although it may be
regarded as the ultimate development of existing tendencies,
yet has no immediate bearing on any actual
condition of the world.</p>
<p>The ideal of the tragic poet may be less perfect; or
rather he does not attempt to set before us abstractedly
any single ideal. But the grand types of character
which he presents to the world are not merely imaginary.
They are creatures of flesh and blood, men and women,
to whom the unsullied purity of their homes, the freedom
<span class="page2">[page xvii]</span>
and power of their country, the respect and love
of their fellow-citizens, are inestimably dear. From a
Platonic, and still more from a Christian point of view,
the best morality of the age of Pericles is no doubt
defective. Such counsels of perfection as ‘Love your
enemies’, or ‘A good man can harm no one, not even
an enemy’,—are beyond the horizon of tragedy, unless
dimly seen in the person of Antigone. The coexistence
of savage vindictiveness with the most affectionate tenderness
is characteristic of heroes and heroines alike, and
produces some of the most moving contrasts. But the
tenderness is no less deep and real for this, and while
the chief persons are thus passionate, the Greek lesson
of moderation and reasonableness is taught by the
event, whether expressed or not by the mouth of sage
or prophet or of the ‘ideal bystander’.</p>
<p>Greek tragedy, then, is a religious art, not merely
because associated with the festival of Dionysus, nor
because the life which it represented was that of men
who believed, with all the Hellenes, in Zeus, Apollo,
and Athena, or in the power of Moira and the Erinyes,—not
merely because it represented</p>
<div class="poem"><span class="i3">‘the dread strife<br></span>
<span>Of poor humanity’s afflicted will<br></span>
<span>Struggling in vain with ruthless destiny,’<br></span></div>
<p>but much more because it awakened in the Athenian
spectator emotions of wonder concerning human life,
and of admiration for nobleness in the unfortunate—a
sense of the infinite value of personal uprightness and
of domestic purity—which in the most universal sense
of the word were truly religious,—because it expressed
a consciousness of depths which Plato never fathomed,
and an ideal of character which, if less complete than
Shakespeare’s, is not less noble. It is indeed a ‘rough’
generalization that ranks the Agamemnon with the
Adoniazusae as a religious composition.</p>
<p>II. This spiritual side of tragic poetry deserves to be
emphasized both as the most essential aspect of it, and
as giving it the most permanent claim to lasting recognition.
<span class="page2">[page xviii]</span>
And yet, apart from this, merely as dramas,
the works of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides will
never cease to be admired. These poets are teachers,
but they teach through art. To ask simply, as Carlyle
once did, ‘What did they think?’ is not the way to
understand or learn from them.</p>
<p>Considered simply as works of art, the plays of
Sophocles stand alone amongst dramatic writings in
their degree of concentration and complex unity.</p>
<p>1. The interest of a Sophoclean drama is always intensely
personal, and is almost always centred in an
individual destiny. In other words, it is not historical
or mythical, but ethical. Single persons stand out
magnificently in Aeschylus. But the action is always
larger than any single life. Each tragedy or trilogy
resembles the fragment of a sublime Epic poem. Mighty
issues revolve about the scene, whether this is laid on
Earth or amongst the Gods, issues far transcending
the fate of Orestes or even of Prometheus. In the perspective
painting of Sophocles, these vast surroundings
fall into the background, and the feelings of the spectator
are absorbed in sympathy with the chief figure
on the stage, round whom the other characters—the
members of the chorus being included—are grouped
with the minutest care.</p>
<p>2. In this grouping of the persons, as well as in the
conduct of the action, Sophocles is masterly in his use
of pathetic contrast. This motive must of course enter
into all tragedy—nothing can be finer than the contrast
of Cassandra to Clytemnestra in the Agamemnon,—but
in Sophocles it is all-pervading, and some of the minor
effects of it are so subtle that although inevitably felt
by the spectator they are often lost upon the mere
reader or student. And every touch, however transient,
is made to contribute to the main effect.</p>
<p>To recur once more to the much-abused analogy of
statuary:—the work of Aeschylus may be compared to
a colossal frieze, while that of Sophocles resembles the
pediment of a smaller temple. Or if, as in considering
the Orestean trilogy, the arrangement of the pediment
<span class="page2">[page xix]</span>
affords the more fitting parallel even for Aeschylus, yet
the forms are so gigantic that minute touches of characterization
and of contrast are omitted as superfluous.
Whereas in Sophocles, it is at once the finish of the chief
figure and the studied harmony of the whole, which
have led his work to be compared with that of his
contemporary Phidias. Such comparison, however, is
useful by way of illustration merely. It must never be
forgotten that, as Lessing pointed out to some who
thought the Philoctetes too sensational, analogies between
the arts are limited by essential differences of
material and of scope. All poetry represents successive
moments. Its figures are never in repose. And although
the action of Tragedy is concentrated and revolves
around a single point, yet it is a dull vision that confounds
rapidity of motion with rest.</p>
<p>3. Sophocles found the subjects of his dramas already
embodied not only in previous tragedies but in Epic and
Lyric poetry. And there were some fables, such as that
of the death of Oedipus at Colonos, which seem to have
been known to him only through oral tradition. For
some reason which is not clearly apparent, both he and
Aeschylus drew more largely from the Cyclic poets than
from ‘our Homer’. The inferior and more recent Epics,
which are now lost, were probably more episodical, and
thus presented a more inviting repertory of legends than
the Iliad and Odyssey.</p>
<p>Arctinus of Lesbos had treated at great length the
story of the House of Thebes. The legend of Orestes,
to which there are several allusions, not always consistent
with each other, in the Homeric poems, had been
a favourite and fruitful subject of tradition and of
poetical treatment in the intervening period. Passages
of the Tale of Troy, in which other heroes than Achilles
had the pre-eminence, had been elaborated by Lesches
and other Epic writers of the Post-Homeric time. The
voyage of the Argonauts, another favourite heroic
theme, supplied the subjects of many dramas which
have disappeared. Lastly, the taking of Oechalia by
<span class="page2">[page xx]</span>
Heracles, and the events which followed it, had been
narrated in a long poem, in which one version of that
hero’s multiform legend was fully set forth.</p>
<p>The subjects of the King Oedipus, Oedipus at
Colonos, and Antigone, are taken from the Tale of
Thebes, the Aias and the Philoctetes are founded on
incidents between the end of the Iliad and the taking
of Troy, the Electra represents the vengeance of
Orestes, the crowning event in the tale of ‘Pelops’
line’, the Trachiniae recounts the last crisis in the life
of Heracles.</p>
<p>4. Of the three Theban plays, the Antigone was first
composed, although its subject is the latest. Aeschylus
in the Seven against Thebes had already represented
the young heroine as defying the victorious citizens who
forbade the burial of her brother, the rebel Polynices.
He allowed her to be supported in her action by a band
of sympathizing friends. But in the play of Sophocles
she stands alone, and the power which she defies is not
that of the citizens generally, but of Creon, whose will
is absolute in the State. Thus the struggle is intensified,
and both her strength and her desolation become more
impressive, while the opposing claims of civic authority
and domestic piety are more vividly realized, because
either is separately embodied in an individual will. By
the same means the situation is humanized to the last
degree, and the heart of the spectator, although strained
to the uttermost with pity for the heroic maiden whose
life when full of brightest hopes was sacrificed to affection
and piety, has still some feeling left for the living
desolation of the man, whose patriotic zeal, degenerating
into tyranny, brought his city to the brink of ruin,
and cost him the lives of his two sons and of his wife,
whose dying curse, as well as that of Haemon, is denounced
upon him.</p>
<p>In the Oedipus Tyrannus, Sophocles goes back to the
central crisis of the Theban story. And again he fixes
our attention, not so much on the fortunes of the city,
or of the reigning house, as on the man Oedipus, his
glory and his fall.—</p>
<p><span class="page2">[page xxi]</span></p>
<div class="poem"><span>‘O mirror of our fickle state<br></span>
<span>Since man on earth unparalleled!<br></span>
<span>The rarer thy example stands,<br></span>
<span>By how much from the top of wondrous glory,<br></span>
<span>Strongest of mortal men,<br></span>
<span>To lowest pitch of abject fortune thou art fallen<a class="fnref pginternal" href="#Pref2_fn_2">[2]</a>.<br></span></div>
<p>The horror and the pity of it are both enhanced by
the character of Oedipus—his essential innocence, his
affectionateness, his uncalculating benevolence and
public spirit;—while his impetuosity and passionateness
make the sequel less incredible.</p>
<p>The essential innocence of Oedipus, which survives
the ruin of his hopes in this world, supplies the chief
motive of the Oedipus at Colonos. This drama, which
Sophocles is said to have written late in life, is in many
ways contrasted with the former Oedipus. It begins
with pity and horror, and ends with peace. It is only
in part founded on Epic tradition, the main incident
belonging apparently to the local mythology of the
poet’s birthplace. It also implies a later stage of ethical
reflection, and in this respect resembles the Philoctetes;
it depends more on lyrical and melodramatic effects,
and allows more room for collateral and subsidiary
motives than any other of the seven. Yet in its principal
theme, the vindication or redemption of an essentially
noble spirit from the consequences of error, it
repeats a note which had been struck much earlier in the
Aias with great force, although with some crudities of
treatment which are absent from the later drama.</p>
<p>5. In one of the Epic poems which narrated the fall of
Troy, the figure of Aias was more prominent than in the
Iliad. He alone and unassisted was there said to have
repulsed Hector from the ships, and he had the chief
share, although in this he was aided by Odysseus, in
rescuing the dead body of Achilles. Yet Achilles’
arms were awarded by the votes of the chieftains, as the
prize of valour, not to Aias, but to Odysseus. This, no
doubt, meant that wisdom is better than strength. But
<span class="page2">[page xxii]</span>
the wisdom of Odysseus in these later Epics was often
less nobly esteemed than in the Iliad and Odyssey, and
was represented as alloyed with cunning.</p>
<p>Aias has withdrawn with his Salaminians, in a rage,
from the fight, and after long brooding by the ships his
wrath has broken forth into a blaze which would have
endangered the lives of Odysseus and the Atridae, had
not Athena in her care for them changed his anger into
madness. Hence, instead of slaying the generals, he
makes havoc amongst the flocks and herds, which as
the result of various forays were the common property
of the whole army. The truth is discovered by Odysseus
with the help of Athena, and from being next to
Achilles in renown, Aias becomes the object of universal
scorn and hatred. The sequel of this hour of his downfall
is the subject of the Aias of Sophocles. After
lamenting his fate, the hero eludes the vigilance of his
captive bride Tecmessa, and of his Salaminian mariners,
and, in complete solitude, falls upon his sword. He is
found by Tecmessa and by his half-brother Teucer, who
has returned too late from a raid in the Mysian highlands.
The Atridae would prohibit Aias’ funeral; but Odysseus,
who has been specially enlightened by Athena,
advises generous forbearance, and his counsel prevails.
The part representing the disgrace and death of Aias is
more affecting to modern readers than the remainder of
the drama. But we should bear in mind that the vindication
of Aias after death, and his burial with undiminished
honours, had an absorbing interest for the
Athenian and Salaminian spectator.</p>
<p>Philoctetes also is rejected by man and accepted by
Destiny. The Argives in his case, as the Thebans in
the case of Oedipus, are blind to the real intentions of
the Gods.</p>
<p>The Philoctetes, like the Oedipus at Colonos, was a
work of Sophocles’ old age; and while it can hardly be
said that the fire of tragic feeling is abated in either of
these plays, dramatic effect is modified in both of them
by the influence of the poet’s contemplative mood. The
interest of the action in the Philoctetes is more inward
<span class="page2">[page xxiii]</span>
and psychological than in any other ancient drama.
The change of mind in Neoptolemus, the stubborn fixity
of will in Philoctetes, contrasted with the confiding
tenderness of his nature, form the elements of a dramatic
movement at once extremely simple and wonderfully
sustained. No purer ideal of virtuous youth has
been imagined than the son of Achilles, who in this play,
though sorely tempted, sets faithfulness before ambition.</p>
<p>6. In the Electra, which, though much earlier than the
Philoctetes, is still a work of his mature genius, our poet
appears at first sight to be in unequal competition with
Aeschylus. If the Theban trilogy of the elder poet had
remained entire, a similar impression might have been
produced by the Oedipus Tyrannus. It is best to lay
such comparisons aside, and to consider the work of
Sophocles simply on its own merits. The subject, as
he has chosen to treat it, is the heroic endurance of a
woman who devotes her life to the vindication of intolerable
wrongs done to her father, and the restoration
of her young brother to his hereditary rights. Hers is
the human agency which for this purpose works together
with Apollo. But the divine intention is concealed
from her. She suffers countless indignities from
her father’s enemies, of whom her own mother is the
chief. And, at length, all her hopes are shattered by
the false tidings that Orestes is no more. Even then
she does not relinquish her resolve. And the revulsion
from her deep sorrow to extremity of joy, when she finds
Orestes at her side and ready to perform the act of
vengeance in his own person, is irresistably affecting,
even when the play is only read.</p>
<p>Sophocles is especially great in the delineation of ideal
female characters. The heroic ardour of Antigone, and
the no less heroic persistence and endurance of Electra,
are both founded on the strength of their affection.
And the affection in both cases is what some moderns
too have called the purest of human feelings, the love of
a sister for a brother. Another aspect of that world-old
marvel, ‘the love of women,’ was presented in Aias’
captive bride, Tecmessa. This softer type also attains
<span class="page2">[page xxiv]</span>
to heroic grandeur in Dêanira, the wronged wife of
Heracles, whose fatal error is caused by the innocent
working of her wounded love.</p>
<p>It is strange that so acute a critic as A.W. Schlegel
should have doubted the Sophoclean authorship of the
Trachiniae. If its religious and moral lessons are even
less obtrusive than those of either Oedipus and of the
Antigone, there is no play which more directly pierces
to the very heart of humanity. And it is a superficial
judgement which complains that here at all events our
sympathies are distracted between the two chief persons,
Dêanira and Heracles. To one passion of his, to one
fond mistake of hers, the ruin of them both is due. Her
love has made their fates inseparable. And the spectator,
in sharing Hyllus’ grief, is afflicted for them both
at once. We may well recognize in this treatment of
the death of Heracles the hand of him who wrote—</p>

<p>7. It is unnecessary to expatiate here on the merits
of construction in which these seven plays are generally
acknowledged to be unrivalled; the natural way in
which the main situation is explained, the suddenness
and inevitableness of the complications, the steadily
sustained climax of emotion until the action culminates,
the preservation of the fitting mood until the end, the
subtlety and effectiveness of the minor contrasts of
situation and character<a class="fnref pginternal" href="#Pref2_fn_4">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>But it may not be irrelevant to observe that the
‘acting qualities’ of Sophocles, as of Shakespeare, are
<span class="page2">[page xxv]</span>
best known to those who have seen him acted, whether
in Greek, as by the students at Harvard<a class="fnref pginternal" href="#Pref2_fn_5">[5]</a> and Toronto<a class="fnref pginternal" href="#Pref2_fn_6">[6]</a>,
and more recently at Cambridge<a class="fnref pginternal" href="#Pref2_fn_7">[7]</a>, or in English long
ago by Miss Helen Faucit (since Lady Martin<a class="fnref pginternal" href="#Pref2_fn_8">[8]</a>), or still
earlier and repeatedly in Germany, or in the French
version of the Antigone by MM. Maurice and Vacquerie
(1845) or of King Oedipus by M. Lacroix, in
which the part of Œdipe Roi was finely sustained by
M. Geoffroy in 1861, and by M. Mounet Sully in 1881<a class="fnref pginternal" href="#Pref2_fn_9">[9]</a>.
With reference to the latter performance, which was
continued throughout the autumn season, M. Francisque
Sarcey wrote an article for the <i>Temps</i> newspaper of
August 15, 1881, which is full of just and vivid appreciation.
At the risk of seeming absurdly ‘modern’,
I will quote from this article some of the more striking
passages.</p>
<blockquote><div><p>‘Ce troisième et ce quatrième actes, les plus émouvants
qui se soient jamais produits sur aucune scène,
se composent d’une suite de narrations, qui viennent
l’une après l’autre frapper au cœur d’Œdipe, et qui ont
leur contrecoup dans l’âme des spectateurs. Je ne sais
qu’une pièce au monde qui soit construite de la sorte,
c’est l’<i>École des Femmes</i>. Ce rapprochement vous paraîtra
<span class="page2">[page xxvi]</span>
singulier, sans doute.... Mais ... c’est dans
le vieux drame grec comme dans la comédie du maître
français une trouvaille de génie....</p>
<p>‘Sophocle a voulu, après des émotions si terribles,
après des angoisses si sèches, ouvrir la source des larmes:
il a écrit un cinquième acte....</p>
<p>‘Les yeux crevés d’Œdipe ne sont qu’un accident, ou,
si vous aimez mieux, un accessoire, Le poète, sans
s’arrêter à ce détail, a mis sur les lèvres de son héros
toute la gamme des sentiments douloureux qu’excite
une si prodigieuse infortune....</p>
<p>‘À la lecture, elle est un pen longue cette scène de
lamentations. Au théâtre, on n’a pas le temps de la
trouver telle: on pleure de toute son âme et de tous ses
yeux. C’est qu’après avoir eu le cœur si longtemps
serré comme dans un étau, on épreuve comme un soulagement
à sentir en soi jaillir la source des larmes.
Sophocle, qui semble avoir été le plus malin des dramaturges,
comme il est le plus parfait des écrivains dramatiques,
a cherché là un effet de contraste dont l’effet est
immanquant sur le public.’</p></div></blockquote>
<p>These and other like remarks of one of the best-known
critics of the Parisian stage show that the dramatic art
of Sophocles is still a living power.</p>
<p>I am well aware how feeble and inadequate the present
attempted reproduction must appear to any reader who
knows the Greek original. There is much to be said for
the view of an eminent scholar who once declared that
he would never think of translating a Greek poet. But
the end of translating is not to satisfy fastidious
scholars, but to make the classics partially accessible to
those whose acquaintance with them would otherwise
be still more defective. Part of this version of Sophocles
was printed several years ago in an imperfect form.
The present volume contains the seven extant plays
entire. As the object has been to give the effect of
each drama as a whole, rather than to dwell on particular
‘beauties’ (which only a poet can render), the fragments
have not been included. But the reader should
<span class="page2">[page xxvii]</span>
bear in mind that the seven plays are less than a tithe
of the work produced by the poet in his lifetime.</p>
<p>It may very possibly be asked why verse has been
employed at all. Why not have listened to Carlyle’s
rough demand, ‘Tell us what they thought; none of
your silly poetry’? The present translator can only
reply that he began with prose, but soon found that, for
tragic dialogue in English, blank verse appeared a more
natural and effective vehicle than any prose style which
he could hope to frame. And with the dialogue in
verse, it was impossible to have the lyric parts in any
sort of prose, simply because the reader would then have
felt an intolerable incongruity. These parts have therefore
been turned into such familiar lyric measures as
seemed at once possible and not unsuitable. And
where this method was found impracticable, as sometimes
in the <i>Commoi</i>, blank metres have again been
used,—with such liberties as seemed appropriate to the
special purpose. The writer’s hope throughout has
been, not indeed fully to transfuse the poetry of Sophocles
into another tongue, but to make the poet’s dramatic
intention to be understood and felt by English
readers. One more such endeavour may possibly find
acceptance at a time when many causes have combined
to awaken a fresh interest at once in dramatic literature
and in Hellenic studies.</p>
<p>The reader who is hitherto unacquainted with the
Greek drama, should be warned that the parts assigned
to the ‘Chorus’ were often distributed among its
several members, who spoke or chanted, singly or in
groups, alternately or in succession. In some cases,
but not in all, <i>Ch. 1</i>, <i>Ch. 2</i>, &amp;c., have been prefixed, to
indicate such an arrangement.</p>

<li id="Pref2_fn_9">The performance of Greek plays (as of the Agamemnon
at Oxford in 1880) is not altogether a new thing in England.
The author of Ion, Mr. Serjeant Talfourd, in his Notice
prefixed to that drama in 1836, mentions, amongst other
reasons for having intended to dedicate it to Dr. Valpy,
‘the exquisite representations of Greek Tragedy, which he
superintended,’ and which ‘made his images vital.’ At
a still earlier time, ‘the great Dr. Parr’ had encouraged
his pupils at Stanmore to recite the dialogue of Greek
tragedies before an audience and in costume. It would
be ungrateful to omit all reference here to some performances
of the Trachiniae in English in Edinburgh and
St. Andrews in 1877, which, though not of a public nature,
are still remembered with delight by those who were
present at them, and were really the first of a series.</li>
