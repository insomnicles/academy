<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>In 1869, having read the Antigone with a pupil who
at the time had a passion for the stage, I was led to
attempt a metrical version of the <i>Antigone</i>, and, by and
by, of the Electra and Trachiniae.<a class="fnref pginternal" href="#Pref1_fn_1">[1]</a> I had the satisfaction
of seeing this last very beautifully produced by an
amateur company in Scotland in 1877; when Mrs.
Fleeming Jenkin may be said to have ‘created’ the
part of Dêanira. Thus encouraged, I completed the
translation of the seven plays, which was published by
Kegan Paul in 1883 and again by Murray in 1896. I
have now to thank Mr. Murray for consenting to this
cheaper issue.</p>
<p>The seven extant plays of Sophocles have been
variously arranged. In the order most frequently
adopted by English editors, the three plays of the
Theban cycle, Oedipus Tyrannus, Oedipus Coloneus,
and Antigone, have been placed foremost.</p>
<p>In one respect this is obviously convenient, as appearing
to present continuously a connected story.
But on a closer view, it is in two ways illusory.</p>
<p>1. The Antigone is generally admitted to be, comparatively
speaking, an early play, while the Oedipus
Coloneus belongs to the dramatist’s latest manner;
the first Oedipus coming in somewhere between the
two. The effect is therefore analogous to that produced
on readers of Shakespeare by the habit of placing
Henry VI after Henry IV and V. But tragedies and
‘histories’ or chronicle plays are not <i>in pari materia</i>.</p>
<p>2. The error has been aggravated by a loose way of
speaking of ‘the Theban Trilogy’, a term which could
only be properly applicable if the three dramas had been
produced in the same year. I have therefore now
<span class="page2">[page xii]</span>
arranged the seven plays in an order corresponding to
the most probable dates of their production, viz. Antigone,
Aias, King Oedipus, Electra, Trachiniae, Philoctetes,
and Oedipus at Colonos. A credible tradition
refers the Antigone to 445 B.C. The Aias appears to
be not much later—it may even be earlier—than the
Antigone. The Philoctetes was produced in 408 B.C.,
when the poet was considerably over eighty. The
Oedipus at Colonos has always been believed to be a
composition of Sophocles’ old age. It is said to have
been produced after his death, though it may have
been composed some years earlier. The tragedy of
King Oedipus, in which the poet’s art attained its
maturity, is plausibly assigned to an early year of the
Peloponnesian war (say 427 B.C.), the Trachiniae to
about 420 B.C. The time of the Electra is doubtful;
but Professor Jebb has shown that, on metrical grounds,
it should be placed after, rather than before, King
Oedipus. Even the English reader, taking the plays
as they are grouped in this volume, may be aware of
a gradual change of manner, not unlike what is perceptible
in passing from Richard II to Macbeth, and from
Macbeth to The Winter’s Tale or Cymbeline. For
although the supposed date of the Antigone was long
subsequent to the poet’s first tragic victory, the forty
years over which the seven plays are spread saw many
changes of taste in art and literature.</p>
