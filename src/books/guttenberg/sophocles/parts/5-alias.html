<h3>THE PERSONS</h3>
<ul class="TOC">
<li>ATHENA.</li>
<li>ODYSSEUS.</li>
<li>AIAS, <i>the son of Telamon.</i></li>
<li>CHORUS <i>of Salaminian Mariners.</i></li>
<li>TECMESSA.</li>
<li><i>A Messenger.</i></li>
<li>TEUCER, <i>half brother of Aias.</i></li>
<li>MENELAUS.</li>
<li>AGAMEMNON.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>EURYSAKÈS, <i>the child of Aias and Tecmessa, appears,
but does not speak.</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="lftbrk">SCENE. Before the encampment of Aias on the shore
of the Troad. Afterwards a lonely place beyond
Rhoeteum.</p>
<p class="left">Time, towards the end of the Trojan War.</p>
<div class="ctr"><p class="break"><span class="page2">[page 42]</span>
<i>‘A wounded spirit who can bear?’</i></p></div>
<p class="break">After the death of Achilles, the armour made for him by
Hephaestus was to be given to the worthiest of the surviving
Greeks. Although Aias was the most valiant, the judges
made the award to Odysseus, because he was the wisest.</p>
<p>Aias in his rage attempts to kill the generals; but
Athena sends madness upon him, and he makes a raid
upon the flocks and herds of the army, imagining the
bulls and rams to be the Argive chiefs. On awakening
from his delusion, he finds that he has fallen irrecoverably
from honour and from the favour of the Greeks. He also
imagines that the anger of Athena is unappeasable. Under
this impression he eludes the loving eyes of his captive-bride
Tecmessa, and of his Salaminian comrades, and falls
on his sword. (‘The soul and body rive not more in parting
Than greatness going off.’)</p>
<p>But it is revealed through the prophet Calchas, that the
wrath of Athena will last only for a day; and on the return
of Teucer, Aias receives an honoured funeral, the tyrannical
reclamations of the two sons of Atreus being overcome by
the firm fidelity of Teucer and the magnanimity of Odysseus,
who has been inspired for this purpose by Athena.</p>

<h3>AIAS</h3>
<p class="sdn"><span class="cnm">ATHENA</span> (above). <span class="cnm">ODYSSEUS</span>.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATHENA.</span>
Oft have I seen thee, Laërtiades,<br>
Intent on some surprisal of thy foes;<br>
As now I find thee by the seaward camp,<br>
Where Aias holds the last place in your line,<br>
Lingering in quest, and scanning the fresh print<br>
Of his late footsteps, to be certified<br>
If he keep house or no. Right well thy sense<br>
Hath led thee forth, like some keen hound of Sparta!<br>
The man is even but now come home, his head<br>
And slaughterous hands reeking with ardent toil.<br>
Thou, then, no longer strain thy gaze within<br>
Yon gateway, but declare what eager chase<br>
Thou followest, that a god may give thee light.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ODYSSEUS.</span>
Athena, ’tis thy voice! Dearest in heaven,<br>
How well discerned and welcome to my soul<br>
From that dim distance doth thine utterance fly<br>
In tones as of Tyrrhenian trumpet clang!<br>
Rightly hast thou divined mine errand here,<br>
Beating this ground for Aias of the shield,<br>
The lion-quarry whom I track to day.<br>
For he hath wrought on us to night a deed<br>
Past thought—if he be doer of this thing;<br>
We drift in ignorant doubt, unsatisfied—<br>
And I unbidden have bound me to this toil.</p>
<p class="dlg">
Brief time hath flown since suddenly we knew<br>
That all our gathered spoil was reaved and slaughtered,<br>
Flocks, herds, and herdmen, by some human hand,<br>
All tongues, then, lay this deed at Aias’ door.<br>
And one, a scout who had marked him, all alone,<br>
With new-fleshed weapon bounding o’er the plain,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 44]</span><span class="linenum">[31-66]</span>
Gave me to know it, when immediately<br>
I darted on the trail, and here in part<br>
I find some trace to guide me, but in part<br>
I halt, amazed, and know not where to look.<br>
Thou com’st full timely. For my venturous course,<br>
Past or to come, is governed by thy will.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
I knew thy doubts, Odysseus, and came forth<br>
Zealous to guard thy perilous hunting-path.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
Dear Queen! and am I labouring to an end?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
Thou schem’st not idly. This is Aias’ deed.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
What can have roused him to a work so wild?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
His grievous anger for Achilles’ arms.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
But wherefore on the flock this violent raid?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
He thought to imbrue his hands with your heart’s blood.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
What? Was this planned against the Argives, then?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
Planned, and performed, had I kept careless guard.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
What daring spirit, what hardihood, was here!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
Alone by night in craft he sought your tents.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
How? Came he near them? Won he to his goal?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
He stood in darkness at the generals’ gates.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
What then restrained his eager hand from murder?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
I turned him backward from his baleful joy,<br>
And overswayed him with blind phantasies,<br>
To swerve against the flocks and well-watched herd<br>
Not yet divided from the public booty.<br>
There plunging in he hewed the horned throng,<br>
And with him Havoc ranged: while now he thought<br>
To kill the Atreidae with hot hand, now this<br>
Now that commander, as the fancy grew.<br>
I, joining with the tumult of his mind,<br>
Flung the wild victim on the fatal net.<br>
Anon, this toil being overpast, he draws<br>
The living oxen and the panting sheep<br>
With cords to his home, not as a hornèd prey,<br>
But as in triumph marshalling his foes:<br>
Whom now he tortures in their bonds within.<br>
<span class="in2">Come, thou shalt see this madness in clear day,</span><br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 45]</span><span class="linenum">[67-100]</span>
And tell to the Argives all I show thee here<br>
Only stand firm and shrink not, I will turn<br>
His eyes askance, not to distinguish thee,<br>
Fear nought—Ho! thou that bindest to thy will<br>
The limbs of those thy captives, come thou forth!<br>
Aias! advance before thy palace gate!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
My Queen! what dost thou? Never call him forth.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
Hush, hush! Be not so timorous, but endure.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
Nay, nay! Enough. He is there, and let him bide.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
What fear you? Dates his valour from to day?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
He was and is my valiant enemy.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
Then is not laughter sweetest o’er a foe?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
No more! I care not he should pass abroad.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
You flinch from seeing the madman in full view.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
When sane, I ne’er had flinched before his face.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
Well, but even now he shall not know thee near.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
How, if his eyes be not transformed or lost?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
I will confound his sense although he see.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
Well, nothing is too hard for Deity.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
Stand still and keep thy place without a word.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
I must. Would I were far away from here!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
Aias! Again I summon thee. Why pay<br>
So scanty heed to her who fights for thee?</p>
<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">AIAS</span> with a bloody scourge.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">AIAS.</span>
Hail, offspring of the Highest! Pallas, hail!<br>
Well hast thou stood by me. Triumphal gold<br>
Shall crown thy temple for this lordly prey.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
A fair intention! But resolve me this:<br>
Hast dyed thy falchion deep in Argive blood?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">AI.</span>
There is my boast; that charge I’ll ne’er deny.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
Have Atreus’ sons felt thy victorious might?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">AI.</span>
They have. No more they’ll make a scorn of me!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
I take it, then, they are dead.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">AI.</span>

<span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
Good. Next inform us of Laërtes’ son;<br>
How stands his fortune? Hast thou let him go?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">AI.</span>
The accursed fox! Dost thou inquire of him?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
Ay, of Odysseus, thy late adversary.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">AI.</span>
He sits within, dear lady, to my joy,<br>
Bound; for I mean him not just yet to die.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
What fine advantage wouldst thou first achieve?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">AI.</span>
First, tie him to a pillar of my hall—</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
Poor wretch! What torment wilt thou wreak on him?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">AI.</span>
Then stain his back with scourging till he die.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
Nay, ’tis too much. Poor caitiff! Not the scourge!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">AI.</span>
Pallas, in all things else have thou thy will,<br>
But none shall wrest Odysseus from this doom.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
Well, since thou art determined on the deed,<br>
Spare nought of thine intent: indulge thy hand!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">AI.</span>

The gods are strong, Odysseus. Dost thou see?<br>
What man than Aias was more provident,<br>
Or who for timeliest action more approved?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
I know of none. But, though he hates me sore,<br>
I pity him, poor mortal, thus chained fast<br>
To a wild and cruel fate,—weighing not so much<br>
His fortune as mine own. For now I feel<br>
All we who live are but an empty show<br>
And idle pageant of a shadowy dream.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATH.</span>
Then, warned by what thou seest, be thou not rash<br>
To vaunt high words toward Heaven, nor swell thy port<br>
Too proudly, if in puissance of thy hand<br>
Thou passest others, or in mines of wealth.<br>
Since Time abases and uplifts again<br>
All that is human, and the modest heart<br>
Is loved by Heaven, who hates the intemperate will.<span class="sdr"><span class="cnm">[</span>Exeunt</span></p>

It toucheth you indeed, and ye shall hear<br>
All from the first. ’Twas midnight, and the lamp<br>
Of eve had died, when, seizing his sharp blade,<br>
He sought on some vain errand to creep forth.<br>
I broke in with my word: ‘Aias, what now?<br>
Why thus uncalled for salliest thou? No voice<br>
Of herald summoned thee. No trumpet blew.<br>
What wouldst thou when the camp is hushed in sleep?’<br>
He with few words well known to women’s ears<br>
Checked me: ‘The silent partner is the best.’<br>
I saw how ’twas and ceased. Forth then he fared<br>
Alone—What horror passed upon the plain<br>
This night, I know not. But he drags within,<br>
Tied in a throng, bulls, shepherd dogs, and spoil<br>
Of cattle and sheep. Anon he butchers them,<br>
Felling or piercing, hacking or tearing wide,<br>
Ribs from breast, limb from limb. Others in rage<br>
He seized and bound and tortured, brutes for men.<br>
Last, out he rushed before the doors, and there<br>
Whirled forth wild language to some shadowy form,<br>
Flouting the generals and Laërtes’ son<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 52]</span><span class="linenum">[303-341]</span>
With torrent laughter and loud triumphing<br>
What in his raid he had wreaked to their despite.<br>
Then diving back within—the fitful storm<br>
Slowly assuaging left his spirit clear.<br>
And when his eye had lightened through the room<br>
Cumbered with ruin, smiting on his brow<br>
He roared; and, tumbling down amid the wreck<br>
Of woolly carnage he himself had made,<br>
Sate with clenched hand tight twisted in his hair.<br>
Long stayed he so in silence. Then flashed forth<br>
Those frightful words of threatening vehemence,<br>
That bade me show him all the night’s mishap,<br>
And whither he was fallen I, dear my friends,<br>
Prevailed on through my fear, told all I knew.<br>
And all at once he raised a bitter cry,<br>
Which heretofore I ne’er had heard, for still<br>
He made us think such doleful utterance<br>
Betokened the dull craven spirit, and still<br>
Dumb to shrill wailings, he would only moan<br>
With half heard muttering, like an angry bull.<br>
But now, by such dark fortune overpowered,<br>
Foodless and dry, amid the quivering heap<br>
His steel hath quelled, all quietly he broods;<br>
And out of doubt his mind intends some harm:<br>
Such words, such groans, burst from him. O my friends.—<br>
Therefore I hastened,—enter and give aid<br>
If aught ye can! Men thus forgone will oft<br>
Grow milder through the counsel of a friend.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MESSENGER.</span>
Friends, my first news is Teucer’s presence here,<br>
Fresh from the Mysian heights; who, as he came<br>
Right toward the generals’ quarter, was assailed<br>
With outcry from the Argives in a throng:<br>
For when they knew his motion from afar<br>
They swarmed around him, and with shouts of blame<br>
From each side one and all assaulted him<br>
As brother to the man who had gone mad<br>
And plotted ’gainst the host,—threatening aloud,<br>
Spite of his strength, he should be stoned, and die.<br>
—So far strife ran, that swords unscabbarded<br>
Crossed blades, till as it mounted to the height<br>
Age interposed with counsel, and it fell.<br>
<span class="in2">But where is Aias to receive my word?</span><br>
Tidings are best told to the rightful ear.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
Not in the hut, but just gone forth, preparing<br>
New plans to suit his newly altered mind.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MESS.</span>
Alas!<br>
Too tardy then was he who sped me hither;<br>
Or I have proved too slow a messenger.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
What point is lacking for thine errand’s speed?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MESS.</span>
Teucer was resolute the man should bide<br>
Close held within-doors till himself should come.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
Why, sure his going took the happiest turn<br>
And wisest, to propitiate Heaven’s high wrath.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MESS.</span>
The height of folly lives in such discourse,<br>
If Calchas have the wisdom of a seer.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
What knowest thou of our state? What saith he? Tell.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MESS.</span>
I can tell only what I heard and saw.<br>
Whilst all the chieftains and the Atridae twain<br>
Were seated in a ring, Calchas alone<br>
Rose up and left them, and in Teucer’s palm<br>
Laid his right hand full friendly; then out-spake<br>
With strict injunction by all means i’ the world<br>
To keep beneath yon covert this one day<br>
Your hero, and not suffer him to rove,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 64]</span><span class="linenum">[755-789]</span>
If he would see him any more alive.<br>
For through this present light—and ne’er again—-<br>
Holy Athena, so he said, will drive him<br>
Before her anger. Such calamitous woe<br>
Strikes down the unprofitable growth that mounts<br>
Beyond his measure and provokes the sky.<br>
‘Thus ever,’ said the prophet, ‘must he fall<br>
Who in man’s mould hath thoughts beyond a man.<br>
And Aias, ere he left his father’s door,<br>
Made foolish answer to his prudent sire.<br>
<span class="in2">‘My son,’ said Telamon, ‘choose victory</span><br>
Always, but victory with an aid from Heaven.’<br>
How loftily, how madly, he replied!<br>
‘Father, with heavenly help men nothing worth<br>
May win success. But I am confident<br>
Without the Gods to pluck this glory down.’<br>
So huge the boast he vaunted! And again<br>
When holy Pallas urged him with her voice<br>
To hurl his deadly spear against the foe,<br>
He turned on her with speech of awful sound:<br>
<span class="in2">‘Goddess, by other Greeks take thou thy stand;</span><br>
Where I keep rank, the battle ne’er shall break.’<br>
Such words of pride beyond the mortal scope<br>
Have won him Pallas’ wrath, unlovely meed.<br>
But yet, perchance, so be it he live to-day,<br>
We, with Heaven’s succour, may restore his peace.’—<br>
Thus far the prophet, when immediately<br>
Teucer dispatched me, ere the assembly rose,<br>
Bearing to thee this missive to be kept<br>
With all thy care. But if my speed be lost,<br>
And Calchas’ word have power, the man is dead.</p>

And so I hear thou’lt stretch thy mouth agape<br>
With big bold words against us undismayed—<br>
Thou, the she-captive’s offspring! High would scale<br>
Thy voice, and pert would be thy strutting gait,<br>
Were but thy mother noble; since, being naught,<br>
So stiff thou stand’st for him who is nothing now,<br>
And swear’st we came not as commanders here<br>
Of all the Achaean navy, nor of thee;<br>
But Aias sailed, thou say’st, with absolute right.<br>
Must we endure detraction from a slave?<br>
What was the man thou noisest here so proudly?<br>
Have I not set my foot as firm and far?<br>
Or stood his valour unaccompanied<br>
In all this host? High cause have we to rue<br>
That prize-encounter for Pelides’ arms,<br>
Seeing Teucer’s sentence stamps our knavery<br>
For all to know it; and nought will serve but ye,<br>
Being vanquished, kick at the award that passed<br>
By voice of the majority in the court,<br>
And either pelt us with rude calumnies,<br>
Or stab at us, ye laggards! with base guile.<br>
Howbeit, these ways will never help to build<br>
The wholesome order of established law,<br>
If men shall hustle victors from their right,<br>
And mix the hindmost rabble with the van.<br>
That craves repression. Not by bulky size,<br>
Or shoulders’ breadth, the perfect man is known;<br>
But wisdom gives chief power in all the world.<br>
The ox hath a huge broadside, yet is held<br>
Right in the furrow by a slender goad;<br>

Who hast uttered forth such daring insolence<br>
For the pale shadow of a vanished man.<br>

Fie! How doth gratitude when men are dead<br>
Prove renegade and swiftly pass away!<br>
This Agamemnon hath no slightest word<br>
Of kind remembrance any more for thee,<br>
Aias, who oftentimes for his behoof<br>
Hast jeoparded thy life in labour of war.<br>
Now all is clean forgotten and out of mind.<br>
Thou who hast multiplied words void of sense,<br>
Hast thou no faintest memory of the time<br>
When who but Aias came and rescued you<br>
Already locked within the toils,—all lost,<br>
The rout began: when close abaft the ships<br>
The torches flared, and o’er the bootless trench<br>
Hector was bounding high to board our fleet?<br>
Who stayed that onset? Was not Aias he?<br>
Whom thou deny’st to have once set foot by thine.<br>
Find ye no merit there? And once again<br>
When he met Hector singly, man to man,<br>
Not by your bidding, but the lottery’s choice,<br>
His lot, that skulked not low adown i’ the heap,<br>
A moist earth-clod, but sure to spring in air,<br>
And first to clear the plumy helmet’s brim.<br>
Yes, Aias was the man, and I too there<br>
Kept rank, the ‘barbarous mother’s servile son.’<br>
I pity thee the blindness of that word.<br>
Who was thy father’s father? A barbarian,<br>
Pelops, the Phrygian, if you trace him far!<br>
And what was Atreus, thine own father? One<br>
Who served his brother with the abominable<br>
Dire feast of his own flesh. And thou thyself<br>
Cam’st from a Cretan mother, whom her sire<br>
Caught with a man who had no right in her<br>
And gave dumb fishes the polluted prey.<br>
Such was thy race. What is the race thou spurnest?<br>
My father, Telamon, of all the host<br>
Being foremost proved in valour, took as prize<br>

My mother for his mate: a princess she,<br>
Born of Laomedon; Alcmena’s son<br>
Gave her to grace him—a triumphant meed.<br>
Thus royally descended and thus brave,<br>
Shall I renounce the brother of my blood,<br>
Or suffer thee to thrust him in his woes<br>
Far from all burial, shameless that thou art?<br>
Be sure that, if ye cast him forth, ye’ll cast<br>
Three bodies more beside him in one spot;<br>
For nobler should I find it here to die<br>
In open quarrel for my kinsman’s weal,<br>
Than for thy wife—or Menelaüs’, was ’t?<br>
Consider then, not my case, but your own.<br>
For if you harm me you will wish some day<br>
