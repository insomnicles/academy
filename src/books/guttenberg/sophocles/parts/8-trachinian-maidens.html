<p class="lftbrk">SCENE. Before the temporary abode of Heracles in Trachis.</p>
<p class="break"><span class="page2">[page 176]</span>
This tragedy is named from the Chorus. From the
subject it might have been called ‘Deanira or the Death
of Heracles’.</p>
<p>The Centaur Nessus, in dying by the arrow of Heracles,
which had been dipped in the venom of the Hydra, persuaded
the bride Deanira, whose beauty was the cause of
his death, to keep some of the blood from the wound as a
love-charm for her husband. Many years afterwards,
when Heracles was returning from his last exploit of sacking
Oechalia, in Euboea, he sent before him, by his herald
Lichas, Iole, the king’s daughter, whom he had espoused.
Deanira, when she had discovered this, commissioned
Lichas when he returned to present his master with a robe,
which she had anointed with the charm,—hoping by this
means to regain her lord’s affection. But the poison of
the Hydra did its work, and Heracles died in agony, Deanira
having already killed herself on ascertaining what she had
done. The action takes place in Trachis, near the Mahae
Gulf, where Heracles and Deanira, by permission of Ceyx,
the king of the country, have been living in exile. At the
close of the drama, Heracles, while yet alive, is carried
towards his pyre on Mount Oeta.</p>

<h3>THE TRACHINIAN MAIDENS</h3>
<p class="dlg"><span class="in2"><span class="cnm">DÊANIRA.</span>
Men say,—’twas old experience gave the word,</span><br>
—‘No lot of mortal, ere he die, can once<br>
Be known for good or evil.’ But I know,<br>
Before I come to the dark dwelling-place,<br>
Mine is a lot, adverse and hard and sore.<br>
Who yet at Pleuron, in my father’s home,<br>
Of all Aetolian women had most cause<br>
To fear my bridal. For a river-god,<br>
Swift Achelôüs, was my suitor there<br>
And sought me from my father in three forms;<br>
Now in his own bull-likeness, now a serpent<br>
Of coiling sheen, and now with manlike build<br>
But bovine front, while from the shadowy beard<br>
Sprang fountain-waters in perpetual spray.<br>
Looking for such a husband, I, poor girl!<br>
Still prayed that Death might find me, ere I knew<br>
That nuptial.—Later, to my glad relief,<br>
Zeus’ and Alcmena’s glorious offspring came,<br>
And closed with him in conflict, and released<br>
My heart from torment. How the fight was won<br>
I could not tell. If any were who saw<br>
Unshaken of dread foreboding, such may speak.<br>
But I sate quailing with an anguished fear,<br>
Lest beauty might procure me nought but pain,<br>
Till He that rules the issue of all strife,<br>
Gave fortunate end—if fortunate! For since,<br>
Assigned by that day’s conquest, I have known<br>
The couch of Heracles, my life is spent<br>
In one continual terror for his fate.<br>
Night brings him, and, ere morning, some fresh toil<br>
Drives him afar. And I have borne him seed;<br>
Which he, like some strange husbandman that farms<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 178]</span>
A distant field, finds but at sowing time<br>
And once in harvest. Such a weary life<br>
Still tossed him to and fro,—no sooner home<br>
But forth again, serving I know not whom.<br>
<span class="in2">And when his glorious head had risen beyond</span><br>
These labours, came the strongest of my fear.<br>
For since he quelled the might of Iphitus,<br>
We here in Trachis dwell, far from our home,<br>
Dependent on a stranger, but where he<br>
Is gone, none knoweth. Only this I know,<br>
His going pierced my heart with pangs for him,<br>
And now I am all but sure he bears some woe.<br>
These fifteen months he hath sent me not one word.<br>
And I have cause for fear. Ere he set forth<br>
He left a scroll with me, whose dark intent<br>
I oft pray Heaven may bring no sorrow down.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ATTENDANT.</span>
Queen Dêanira, many a time ere now<br>

For Heracles? and why not Hyllus first,<br>

Run to his aid?—since we must perish with him,<br>
Or owe our lasting safety to his life.</p>

He left within the house an ancient scroll<br>
Inscribed with characters of mystic note,<br>
Which Heracles had never heretofore,<br>
In former labours, cared to let me see,—<br>
As bound for bright achievement, not for death.<br>
But now, as though his life had end, he told<br>
What marriage-portion I must keep, what shares<br>
He left his sons out of their father’s ground:<br>
And set a time, when fifteen moons were spent,<br>
Counted from his departure, that even then<br>
Or he must die, or if that date were out<br>
And he had run beyond it, he should live<br>
Thenceforth a painless and untroubled life.<br>
Such by Heaven’s fiat was the promised end<br>
Of Heracles’ long labours, as he said;<br>
So once the ancient oak-tree had proclaimed<br>
In high Dodona through the sacred Doves.<br>
Of which prediction on this present hour<br>
In destined order of accomplishment<br>
The veritable issue doth depend.<br>
And I, dear friends, while taking rest, will oft<br>
Start from sweet slumbers with a sudden fear,<br>
Scared by the thought, my life may be bereft<br>

I heard this herald say, while many thronged<br>
To hearken, that this maiden was the cause,<br>
Why lofty-towered Oechalia and her lord<br>
Fell before Heracles, whom Love alone<br>
Of heavenly powers had warmed to this emprise,<br>
And not the Lydian thraldom or the tasks<br>
Of rigorous Omphalè, nor that wild fate<br>
Of rock-thrown Iphitus. Now he thrusts aside<br>
The Love-god, contradicting his first tale.<br>
<span class="in2">When he that was her sire could not be brought</span><br>
To yield the maid for Heracles to hold<br>
In love unrecognized, he framed erelong<br>
A feud about some trifle, and set forth<br>
In arms against this damsel’s fatherland<br>
(Where Eurytus, the herald said, was king)<br>
And slew the chief her father; yea, and sacked<br>
Their city. Now returning, as you see,<br>
He sends her hither to his halls, no slave,<br>
Nor unregarded, lady,—dream not so!<br>
Since all his heart is kindled with desire.<br>
I, O my Queen! thought meet to show thee all<br>
The tale I chanced to gather from his mouth,<br>
Which many heard as well as I, i’ the midst<br>
Of Trachis’ market-place, and can confirm<br>

Lightens down Oeta’s topmost glen, be not<br>

Mankind are never constant to one joy.<br>
Whoso would buffet Love, aspires in vain.<br>
For Love leads even Immortals at his will,<br>
And me. Then how not others, like to me?<br>
’Twere madness, sure, in me to blame my lord<br>

By many, who will tell me. If thou fearest,<br>
Thou hast no cause—for doubtfulness is pain,<br>
But to know all, what harm? His loves ere now<br>
Were they not manifold? And none hath borne<br>
Reproach or evil word from me. She shall not,<br>
Though his new passion were as strong as death;<br>
Since most mine eye hath pitied her, because<br>
Her beauty was the ruin of her life,<br>
And all unweeting, she her own bright land,<br>
Poor hapless one! hath ravaged and enslaved.—<br>
Let that be as it must. But for thy part,<br>
Though false to others, be still true to me.</p>

Thy mortal wishes within mortal bound<br>
So meekly, I will freely tell thee all.<br>
It is as he avers. This maiden’s love,<br>
Piercing through Heracles, was the sole cause,<br>
Why her Oechalia, land of plenteous woe,<br>
Was made the conquest of his spear. And he—<br>
For I dare so far clear him—never bade<br>
Concealment or denial. But myself,<br>
Fearing the word might wound thy queenly heart,<br>
Sinned, if thou count such tenderness a sin.<br>
But now that all is known, for both your sakes,<br>
His, and thine own no less, look favouringly<br>
Upon the woman, and confirm the word<br>
Thou here hast spoken in regard to her:—<br>

Dear friends, while yonder herald in the house<br>
Holds converse with the captives ere he go,<br>
I have stol’n forth to you, partly to tell<br>
The craft my hand hath compassed, and in part,<br>
To crave your pity for my wretchedness.<br>
For I have taken to my hearth a maid,—<br>
And yet, methinks, no maiden any more,<br>
Like some fond shipmaster, taking on board<br>
A cargo fraught with treason to my heart.<br>
And now we two are closed in one embrace<br>
Beneath one coverlet. Such generous meed<br>
For faith in guarding home this dreary while<br>
Hath the kind Heracles our trusty spouse,<br>
Sent in return! Yet, oft as he hath caught<br>
This same distemperature, I know not how<br>
To harbour indignation against him.<br>
But who that is a woman could endure<br>
To dwell with her, both married to one man?<br>
One bloom is still advancing, one doth fade.<br>
The budding flower is cropped, the full-blown head<br>
Is left to wither, while love passeth by<br>
Unheeding. Wherefore I am sore afraid<br>
He will be called my husband, but her mate,<br>
For she is younger. Yet no prudent wife<br>
Would take this angerly, as I have said.<br>
But, dear ones, I will tell you of a way,<br>
Whereof I have bethought me, to prevent<br>
This heart-break. I had hidden of long time<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 193]</span><span class="linenum">[555-591]</span>
In a bronze urn the ancient Centaur’s gift,<br>
Which I, when a mere girl, culled from the wound<br>
Of hairy-breasted Nessus in his death.<br>
He o’er Evenus’ rolling depths, for hire,<br>
Ferried wayfarers on his arm, not plying<br>
Or rowing-boat, or canvas-wingèd bark.<br>
Who, when with Heracles, a new-made bride,<br>
I followed by my father’s sending forth,<br>
Shouldering me too, in the mid-stream, annoyed<br>
With wanton touch. And I cried out; and he,<br>
Zeus’ son, turned suddenly, and from his bow<br>
Sent a wing’d shaft, that whizzed into his chest<br>
To the lungs. Then the weird Thing, with dying voice<br>
Spake to me:—‘Child of aged Oeneüs,<br>
Since thou wert my last burden, thou shalt win<br>
Some profit from mine act, if thou wilt do<br>
What now I bid thee. With a careful hand<br>
Collect and bear away the clotted gore<br>
That clogs my wound, e’en where the monster snake<br>
Had dyed the arrow with dark tinct of gall;<br>
And thou shalt have this as a charm of soul<br>
For Heracles, that never through the eye<br>
Shall he receive another love than thine.’<br>
Whereof bethinking me, for since his death<br>
I kept it in a closet locked with care,<br>
I have applied it to this robe, with such<br>
Addition as his living voice ordained.—<br>
The thing is done. No criminal attempts<br>
Could e’er be mine. Far be they from my thought,<br>
As I abhor the woman who conceives them!<br>
But if by any means through gentle spells<br>
And bonds on Heracles’ affection, we<br>
May triumph o’er this maiden in his heart,<br>
My scheme is perfected. Unless you deem<br>

For, O my friends, the stuff wherewith I dressed<br>
That robe, a flock of soft and milkwhite wool,<br>
Is shrivelled out of sight, not gnawn by tooth<br>
Of any creature here, but, self-consumed,<br>
Frittered and wasting on the courtyard-stones.<br>
<span class="in2">To let you know the circumstance at full,</span><br>
I will speak on. Of all the Centaur-Thing,<br>
When labouring in his side with the fell point<br>
O’ the shaft, enjoined me, I had nothing lost,<br>
But his vaticination in my heart<br>
Remained indelible, as though engraved<br>
With pen of iron upon brass. ’Twas thus:—<br>
I was to keep this unguent closely hid<br>
In dark recesses, where no heat of fire<br>
Or warming ray might reach it, till with fresh<br>
Anointing I addressed it to an end.<br>
So I had done. And now this was to do,<br>
Within my chamber covertly I spread<br>
The ointment with piece of wool, a tuft<br>
Pulled from a home-bred sheep; and, as ye saw,<br>
I folded up my gift and packed it close<br>
In hollow casket from the glaring sun.<br>
But, entering in, a fact encounters me<br>
Past human wit to fathom with surmise.<br>
For, as it happened, I had tossed aside<br>
The bit of wool I worked with, carelessly,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 197]</span><span class="linenum">[696-733]</span>
Into the open daylight, ’mid the blaze<br>
Of Helios’ beam. And, as it kindled warm,<br>
It fell away to nothing, crumbled small,<br>
Like dust in severing wood by sawyers strewn.<br>
So, on the point of vanishing, it lay.<br>
But, from the place where it had lain, brake forth<br>
A frothy scum in clots of seething foam,<br>
Like the rich draught in purple vintage poured<br>
From Bacchus’ vine upon the thirsty ground.<br>
And I, unhappy, know not toward what thought<br>
To turn me, but I see mine act is dire.<br>
For wherefore should the Centaur, for what end,<br>
Show kindness to the cause for whom he died?<br>
That cannot be. But seeking to destroy<br>
His slayer, he cajoled me. This I learn<br>
Too late, by sad experience, for no good.<br>
And, if I err not now, my hapless fate<br>
Is all alone to be his murderess.<br>
For, well I know, the shaft that made the wound<br>
Gave pain to Cheiron, who was more than man;<br>
And wheresoe’er it falls, it ravageth<br>
All the wild creatures of the world. And now<br>
This gory venom blackly spreading bane<br>
From Nessus’ angry wound, must it not cause<br>
The death of Heracles? I think it must.<br>
<span class="in2">Yet my resolve is firm, if aught harm him,</span><br>

I would to heaven one of three things were true:<br>

Furnished with better thoughts than thou hast now!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>

And where didst thou come near him and stand by?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Art thou to hear it? On, then, with my tale!<br>
When after sacking Eurytus’ great city<br>
He marched in triumph with first-fruits of war,—<br>
There is a headland, last of long Euboea,<br>
Surf-beat Cenaeum,—where to his father Zeus<br>
He dedicates high altars and a grove.<br>
There first I saw him, gladdened from desire.<br>
And when he now addressed him to the work<br>
Of various sacrifice, the herald Lichas<br>
Arrived from home, bearing thy fatal gift,<br>
The deadly robe: wherewith invested straight,<br>
As thou hadst given charge, he sacrificed<br>
The firstlings of the spoil, twelve bulls entire,<br>
Each after each. But the full count he brought<br>
Was a clear hundred of all kinds of head.<br>
<span class="in2">Then the all-hapless one commenced his prayer</span><br>
In solemn gladness for the bright array.<br>
But presently, when from the holy things,<br>
And from the richness of the oak-tree core,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 199]</span><span class="linenum">[766-802]</span>
There issued flame mingled with blood, a sweat<br>
Rose on his flesh, and close to every limb<br>
Clung, like stone-drapery from the craftsman’s hand,<br>
The garment, glued unto his side. Then came<br>
The tearing pangs within his bones, and then<br>
The poison feasted like the venomed tooth<br>
Of murderous basilisk.—When this began,<br>
He shouted on poor Lichas, none to blame<br>
For thy sole crime, ‘What guile is here, thou knave?<br>
What was thy fraud in fetching me this robe?’<br>
He, all-unknowing, in an evil hour<br>
Declared his message, that the gift was thine.<br>
Whereat the hero, while the shooting spasm<br>
Had fastened on the lungs, seized him by the foot<br>
Where the ankle turns i’ the socket, and, with a thought,<br>
Hurl’d on a surf-vex’d reef that showed i’ the sea:<br>
And rained the grey pulp from the hair, the brain<br>
Being scattered with the blood. Then the great throng<br>
Saddened their festival with piteous wail<br>
For one in death and one in agony.<br>
And none had courage to approach my sire,—<br>
Convulsed upon the ground, then tossed i’ the air<br>
With horrid yells and crying, till the cliffs<br>
Echoed round, the mountain-promontories<br>
Of Locris, and Euboea’s rugged shore.<br>
Wearied at length with flinging on the earth,<br>
And shrieking oft with lamentable cry,<br>
Cursing the fatal marriage with thyself<br>
The all-wretched, and the bond to Oeneus’ house,<br>
That prize that was the poisoner of his peace,<br>
He lifted a wild glance above the smoke<br>
That hung around, and ’midst the crowd of men<br>
Saw me in tears, and looked on me and said,<br>
‘O son, come near; fly not from my distress,<br>
Though thou shouldst be consumèd in my death,<br>
But lift and bear me forth; and, if thou mayest,<br>
Set me where no one of mankind shall see me.<br>
But if thy heart withhold thee, yet convey me<br>
Out of this land as quickly as ye may.<br>
Let me not die where I am now.’ We then,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 200]</span><span class="linenum">[803-833]</span>
Thus urgently commanded, laid him down<br>
Within our bark, and hardly to this shore<br>
Rowed him convulsed and roaring.—Presently,<br>
He will appear, alive or lately dead.<br>
<span class="in2">Such, mother, is the crime thou hast devised</span><br>
And done against our sire, wherefore let Right<br>
And Vengeance punish thee!—May I pray so?<br>
I may: for thou absolv’st me by thy deed,<br>
Thou that hast slain the noblest of the Earth,<br>
Thy spouse, whose like thou ne’er wilt see again.

<span class="dpgn">[page 203]</span><span class="linenum">[902-946]</span>
Ere he returned to meet him,—out of sight<br>
She hid herself, and fell at the altar’s foot,<br>
And loudly cried that she was left forlorn;<br>
And, taking in her touch each household thing<br>
That formerly she used, poor lady, wept<br>
O’er all; and then went ranging through the rooms,<br>
Where, if there caught her eye the well-loved form<br>
Of any of her household, she would gaze<br>
And weep aloud, accusing her own fate<br>
And her abandoned lot, childless henceforth!<br>
When this was ended, suddenly I see her<br>
Fly to the hero’s room of genial rest.<br>
With unsuspected gaze o’ershadowed near,<br>
I watched, and saw her casting on the bed<br>
The finest sheets of all. When that was done,<br>
She leapt upon the couch where they had lain<br>
And sat there in the midst. And the hot flood<br>
Burst from her eyes before she spake:—‘Farewell,<br>
My bridal bed, for never more shalt thou<br>
Give me the comfort I have known thee give.’<br>
Then with tight fingers she undid her robe,<br>
Where the brooch lay before the breast, and bared<br>
All her left arm and side. I, with what speed<br>
Strength ministered, ran forth to tell her son<br>
The act she was preparing. But meanwhile,<br>
Ere we could come again, the fatal blow<br>
Fell, and we saw the wound. And he, her boy,<br>
Seeing, wept aloud. For now the hapless youth<br>
Knew that himself had done this in his wrath,<br>
Told all too late i’ the house, how she had wrought<br>
Most innocently, from the Centaur’s wit.<br>
So now the unhappy one, with passionate words<br>
And cries and wild embracings of the dead,<br>
Groaned forth that he had slain her with false breath<br>
Of evil accusation, and was left<br>
Orphaned of both, his mother and his sire.<br>
<span class="in2">Such is the state within. What fool is he</span><br>

Foiled in the tangle of a viewless bond.<br>
Yet me nor War-host, nor Earth’s giant brood,<br>
Nor Centaur’s monstrous violence could subdue,<br>
Nor Hellas, nor the Stranger, nor all lands<br>
Where I have gone, cleansing the world from harms.<br>
But a soft woman without manhood’s strain<br>
Alone and weaponless hath conquered me.<br>
Son, let me know thee mine true-born, nor rate<br>
Thy mother’s claim beyond thy sire’s, but bring<br>
Thyself from out the chambers to my hand<br>
Her body that hath borne thee, that my heart<br>
May be assured, if lesser than my pain<br>
It will distress thee to behold her limbs<br>
With righteous torment agonized and torn.<br>
Nay, shrink not, son, but pity me, whom all<br>
May pity—me, who, like a tender girl,<br>
Am heard to weep aloud! This none could say<br>
He knew in me of old; for, murmuring not,<br>
I went with evil fortune, silent still.<br>
Now, such a foe hath found the woman in me!<br>
<span class="in2">Ay, but come near; stand by me, and behold</span><br>
What cause I have for crying. Look but here!<br>
Here is the mystery unveiled. O see!<br>
Ye people, gaze on this poor quivering flesh,<br>
Look with compassion on my misery!<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 208]</span><span class="linenum">[1081-1117]</span>
Ah me!<br>
Ah! ah! Again!<br>
Even now the hot convulsion of disease<br>
Shoots through my side, and will not let me rest<br>
From this fierce exercise of wearing woe.<br>
Take me, O King of Night!<br>
O sudden thunderstroke.<br>
Smite me! O sire, transfix me with the dart<br>
Of thy swift lightning! Yet again that fang<br>
Is tearing; it hath blossomed forth anew,<br>
It soars up to the height!</p>
<p class="dlg">
<span class="in18">O breast and back,</span><br>
O shrivelling arms and hands, ye are the same<br>
That crushed the dweller of the Némean wild,<br>
The lion unapproachable and rude,<br>
The oxherd’s plague, and Hydra of the lake<br>
Of Lerna, and the twi-form prancing throng<br>
Of Centaurs,—insolent, unsociable,<br>
Lawless, ungovernable:—the tuskèd pest<br>
Of Erymanthine glades; then underground<br>
Pluto’s three-headed cur—a perilous fear,<br>
Born from the monster-worm; and, on the verge<br>
Of Earth, the dragon, guarding fruits of gold.<br>
These toils and others countless I have tried,<br>
And none hath triumphed o’er me. But to-day,<br>
Jointless and riven to tatters, I am wrecked<br>
Thus utterly by imperceptible woe;<br>
I, proudly named Alcmena’s child, and His<br>
Who reigns in highest heaven, the King supreme!<br>
<span class="in2">Ay, but even yet, I tell ye, even from here,</span><br>
Where I am nothingness and cannot move,<br>
She who hath done this deed shall feel my power.<br>
Let her come near, that, mastered by my might,<br>
She may have this to tell the world, that, dying,<br>
As living, I gave punishment to wrong.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
O Hellas, how I grieve for thy distress!<br>
How thou wilt mourn in losing him we see!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
My father, since thy silence gives me leave,<br>
Still hear me patiently, though in thy pain!<br>
For my request is just. Lend me thy mind<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 209]</span><span class="linenum">[1117-1149]</span>
Less wrathfully distempered than ’tis now;<br>
Else thou canst never know, where thou art keen<br>
With vain resentment and with vain desire</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Speak what thou wilt and cease, for I in pain<br>
Catch not the sense of thy mysterious talk</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
I come to tell thee of my mother’s case,<br>
And her involuntary unconscious fault.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Base villain! hast thou breathed thy mother’s name,<br>
Thy father’s murderess, in my hearing too!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Her state requires not silence, but full speech.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Her faults in former time might well be told.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
So might her fault to day, couldst thou but know.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Speak, but beware base words disgrace thee not.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
List! She is dead even now with new-given wound.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
By whom? Thy words flash wonder through my woe.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Her own hand slaughtered her, no foreign stroke.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Wretch! to have reft this office from my hands.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Even your rash spirit were softened, if you knew.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
This bodes some knavery. But declare thy thought!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
She erred with good intent. The whole is said.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Good, O thou villain, to destroy thy sire!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
When she perceived that marriage in her home,<br>
She erred, supposing to enchain thy love.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Hath Trachis a magician of such might?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Long since the Centaur Nessus moved her mind<br>
To work this charm for heightening thy desire.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
O horror, thou art here! I am no more.<br>
My day is darkened, boy! Undone, undone!<br>
I see our plight too plainly. woe is me!<br>
Come, O my son! —thou hast no more a father,—<br>
Call to me all the brethren of thy blood,<br>
And poor Alcmena, wedded all in vain<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 210]</span><span class="linenum">[1149-1185]</span>
Unto the Highest, that ye may hear me tell<br>
With my last breath what prophecies I know.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Thy mother is not here, but by the shore<br>
Of Tiryns hath obtained a dwelling-place;<br>
And of thy sons, some she hath with her there,<br>
And some inhabit Thebè’s citadel.<br>
But we who are with thee, sire, if there be aught<br>
That may by us be done, will hear, and do.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Then hearken thou unto this task, and show<br>
If worthily thou art reputed mine.<br>
Now is time to prove thee. My great father<br>
Forewarned me long ago that I should die<br>
By none who lived and breathed, but from the will<br>
Of one now dwelling in the house of death.<br>
And so this Centaur, as the voice Divine<br>
Then prophesied, in death hath slain me living.<br>
And in agreement with that ancient word<br>
I now interpret newer oracles<br>
Which I wrote down on going within the grove<br>
Of the hill-roving and earth-couching Selli,—<br>
Dictated to me by the mystic tongue<br>
Innumerous, of my Father’s sacred tree;<br>
Declaring that my ever instant toils<br>
Should in the time that new hath being and life<br>
End and release me. And I look’d for joy.<br>
But the true meaning plainly was my death.—<br>
No labour is appointed for the dead.—<br>
Then, since all argues one event, my son,<br>
Once more thou must befriend me, and not wait<br>
For my voice goading thee, but of thyself<br>
Submit and second my resolve, and know<br>
Filial obedience for thy noblest rule.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
I will obey thee, father, though my heart<br>
Sinks heavily in approaching such a theme.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Before aught else, lay thy right hand in mine.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Why so intent on this assurance, sire?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Give it at once and be not froward, boy.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
There is my hand: I will gainsay thee nought.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Swear by the head of him who gave me life.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="dpgn">[page 211]</span><span class="linenum">[1186-1221]</span>
<span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Tell me the oath, and I will utter it.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Swear thou wilt do the thing I bid thee do.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
I swear, and make Zeus witness of my troth.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
But if you swerve, pray that the curse may come.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
It will not come for swerving:—but I pray.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Now, dost thou know on Oeta’s topmost height<br>
The crag of Zeus?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
<span class="in8">I know it, and full oft</span><br>
Have stood there sacrificing.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
<span class="in16">Then even there,</span><br>
With thine own hand uplifting this my body,<br>
Taking what friends thou wilt, and having lopped<br>
Much wood from the deep-rooted oak and rough<br>
Wild olive, lay me on the gathered pile,<br>
And burn all with the touch of pine-wood flame.<br>
Let not a tear of mourning dim thine eye;<br>
But silent, with dry gaze, if thou art mine,<br>
Perform it. Else my curse awaits thee still<br>
To weigh thee down when I am lost in night.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
How cruel, O my father, is thy tongue!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
’Tis peremptory. Else, if thou refuse,<br>
Be called another’s and be no more mine.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Alas that thou shouldst challenge me to this,<br>
To be thy murderer, guilty of thy blood!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Not I, in sooth: but healer of my pain,<br>
And sole preserver from a life of woe.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
How can it heal to burn thee on the pyre?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
If this act frighten thee, perform the rest.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Mine arms shall not refuse to carry thee.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
And wilt thou gather the appointed wood?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
So my hand fire it not. In all but this,<br>
Not scanting labour, I will do my part.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Enough. ’Tis well. And having thus much given<br>
Add one small kindness to a list so full.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
How great soe’er it were, it should be done.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
The maid of Eurytus thou knowest, I ween.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Of Iolè thou speak’st, or I mistake.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Of her. This then is all I urge, my son.<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 212]</span><span class="linenum">[1222-1258]</span>
When I am dead, if thou wouldst show thy duty,<br>
Think of thine oath to me, and, on my word,<br>
Make her thy wife: nor let another man<br>
Take her, but only thou; since she hath lain<br>
So near this heart. Obey me, O my boy!<br>
And be thyself the maker of this bond.<br>
To spurn at trifles after great things given,<br>
Were to confound the meed already won.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Oh, anger is not right, when men are ill!<br>
But who could bear to see thee in this mind?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
You murmur, as you meant to disobey.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
How can I do it, when my mother’s death<br>
And thy sad state sprang solely from this girl?<br>
Who, not possessed with furies, could choose this?<br>
Far better, father, for me too to die,<br>
Than to live still with my worst enemy.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
This youth withdraws his reverence in my death.<br>
But, if thou yield’st not to thy father’s best,<br>
The curse from Heaven shall dog thy footsteps still.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Ah! thou wilt tell me that thy pain is come.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Yea, for thou wak’st the torment that had slept.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Ay me! how cross and doubtful is my way!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Because you will reject your father’s word.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Must I be taught impiety from thee?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
It is not impious to content my heart.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Then you require this with an absolute will?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
And bid Heaven witness to my strong command.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Then I will do it, for the act is thine.<br>
I will not cast it off. Obeying thee,<br>
My sire, the Gods will ne’er reprove my deed.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Thou endest fairly. Now, then, O my son,<br>
Add the performance swiftly, that, before<br>
Some spasm or furious onset of my pain<br>
Have seized me, ye may place me on the pyre.<br>
Come, loiter not, but lift me. Now my end<br>
Is near, the last cessation of my woe.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HYL.</span>
Since thy command is urgent, O my sire!<br>
We tarry not, but bear thee to the pyre.</p>
