<h2>OEDIPUS AT COLONOS</h2>
<h3>THE PERSONS</h3>
<ul class="TOC">
<li>OEDIPUS, <i>old and blind.</i></li>
<li>ANTIGONE, <i>his daughter, a young girl.</i></li>
<li>ISMENE, <i>his daughter, a young girl.</i></li>

Oedipus had remained at Thebes for some time after his
fall. But he was afterwards banished by the command
of Creon, with the consent of his own sons. Their intention
at first was to lay no claim to the throne. But by-and-by
ambition prevailed with Eteocles, the younger-born, and
he persuaded Creon and the citizens to banish his elder
brother. Polynices took refuge at Argos, where he
married the daughter of Adrastus, and levied an army of
auxiliaries to support his pretensions to the throne of
Thebes. Before going into exile Oedipus had cursed his
sons.</p>
<p>Antigone after a while fled forth to join her father and
support him in his wanderings. Ismenè also once brought
him secret intelligence.</p>
<p>Years have now elapsed, and the Delphian oracle proclaims
that if Oedipus dies in a foreign land the enemies of
Thebes shall overcome her.</p>
<p>In ignorance of this fact, Oedipus, now aged as well as
blind, and led by his daughter Antigone, appears before
the grove of the Eumenides, at Colonos, in the neighbourhood
of Athens. He has felt an inward intimation, which
is strengthened by some words of the oracle received by
him long since at Delphi, that his involuntary crimes have
been atoned for, and that the Avenging Deities will now
receive him kindly and make his cause their own.</p>
<p>After some natural hesitation on the part of the village-councillors
of Colonos, Oedipus is received with princely
magnanimity by Theseus, who takes him under the protection
of Athens, and defends him against the machinations
of Creon.</p>
<p>Thus the blessing of the Gods, which Oedipus carried with
him, is secured to Athens, and denied to Thebes. The
craft of Creon and the prayers of Polynices alike prove
unavailing. Then the man of many sorrows, whose
essential nobleness has survived them all, passes away
mysteriously from the sight of men.</p>
<p>The scene is laid at Colonos, a suburb of Athens much
frequented by the upper classes, especially the Knights
(see Thuc. viii. 67); and before the sacred grove of the
Eumenides, or Gentle Goddesses, a euphemistic title for the
Erinyes, or Goddesses of Vengeance.</p>

Antigone, child of the old blind sire,<br>
What land is here, what people? Who to-day<br>
Shall dole to Oedipus, the wandering exile,<br>
Their meagre gifts? Little I ask, and less<br>
Receive with full contentment; for my woes,<br>
And the long years ripening the noble mind,<br>
Have schooled me to endure.—But, O my child,<br>
If thou espiest where we may sit, though near<br>
Some holy precinct, stay me and set me there,<br>

To hear the will of strangers and to obey.</p>

That shields her, looks far distant; but this ground<br>

Thick-fluttering song-birds make sweet melody.<br>
Here then repose thee on this unhewn stone.<br>

With blessing to the men who sheltered me,<br>

With dry cold lips greeting your sober shrine.<br>

So in your case, my daughters, they who should<br>
Have ta’en this burden on them, bide at home<br>
Like maidens, while ye take their place, and lighten<br>
My miseries by your toil. Antigone,<br>
E’er since her childhood ended, and her frame<br>

Was firmly knit, with ceaseless ministry<br>
Still tends upon the old man’s wandering,<br>
Oft in the forest ranging up and down<br>
Fasting and barefoot through the burning heat<br>
Or pelting rain, nor thinks, unhappy maid,<br>
Of home or comfort, so her father’s need<br>
Be satisfied. And thou, that camest before,<br>
Eluding the Cadmeans, and didst tell me<br>
What words Apollo had pronounced on me.<br>
And when they banished me, stood’st firm to shield me,<br>
What news, Ismene, bring’st thou to thy sire<br>
To day? What mission sped thee forth? I know<br>
Thou com’st not idly, but with fears for me.</p>

Father, I will not say what I endured<br>
In searching out the place that sheltered thee.<br>
To tell it o’er would but renew the pain.<br>
But of the danger now encompassing<br>
Thine ill starred sons,—of that I came to speak.<br>
At first they strove with Creon and declared<br>
The throne should be left vacant and the town<br>
Freed from pollution,—paying deep regard<br>
In their debate to the dark heritage<br>
Of ruin that o’ershadowed all thy race.<br>
Far different is the strife which holds them now,<br>
Since some great Power, joined to their sinful mind,<br>
Incites them both to seize on sovereign sway.<br>
Eteocles, in pride of younger years,<br>
Robbed elder Polynices of his right,<br>
Dethroned and banished him. To Argos then<br>
Goes exiled Polynices, and obtains<br>
Through intermarriage a strong favouring league,<br>
Whose word is, ‘Either Argos vanquishes<br>
The seed of Cadmus or exalts their fame’<br>
This, father, is no tissue of empty talk,<br>
But dreadful truth, nor can I tell where Heaven<br>
Is to reveal his mercy to thy woe.</p>

To this contention and arbitrament<br>
Of battle which they now assay and lift<br>
The threatening spear! So neither he who wields<br>
The sceptred power should keep possession still,<br>
Nor should his brother out of banishment<br>
Ever return:—who, when their sire—when I<br>
Was shamefully thrust from my native land,<br>
Checked not my fall nor saved me, but, for them,<br>
I was driven homeless and proclaimed an exile.<br>
Ye will tell me ’twas in reason that the State<br>
Granted this boon to my express desire.<br>
Nay; for in those first hours of agony,<br>
When my heart raged, and it seemed sweetest to me<br>
To die the death, and to be stoned with stones,<br>
No help appeared to yield me that relief.<br>
But after lapse of days, when all my pain<br>
Was softened, and I felt that my hot spirit<br>
Had run to fierce excess of bitterness<br>
In wreaking mine offence—then, then the State<br>
Drove me for ever from the land, and they,<br>
Their father’s sons, who might have saved their father,<br>
Cared not to help him, but betrayed by them,<br>
For lack of one light word, I wandered forth<br>
To homeless banishment and beggary.<br>
But these weak maidens to their nature’s power<br>
Have striven to furnish me with means to live<br>
And dwell securely, girded round with love.<br>
My sons have chosen before their father’s life<br>
A lordly throne and sceptred sovereignty.<br>
But never shall they win me to their aid,<br>

Nor shall the Theban throne for which they strive<br>
Bring them desired content. That well I know,<br>
Comparing with my daughter’s prophecies<br>
Those ancient oracles which Phoebus once<br>
Spake in mine ear. Then let them send to seek me<br>
Creon, or who is strongest in their State.<br>
For if ye, strangers, will but add your might<br>
To the protection of these awful Powers,<br>
The guardians of your soil, to shelter me,<br>
Ye shall acquire for this your State a saviour<br>
Mighty to save, and ye shall vex my foes.</p>

Dear son of Aegeus, to the Gods alone<br>
Comes never Age nor Death. All else i’ the world<br>
Time, the all subduer, merges in oblivion.<br>
Earth and men’s bodies weaken, fail, and perish.<br>
Faith withers, breach of faith springs up and glows<br>
And neither men nor cities that are friends<br>
Breathe the same spirit with continuing breath.<br>
Love shall be turned to hate, and hate to love<br>
With many hereafter, as with some to-day.<br>
And though, this hour, between great Thebes and thee<br>
No cloud be in the heaven, yet moving Time<br>
Enfolds a countless brood of days to come,<br>
Wherein for a light cause they shall destroy<br>
Your now harmonious league with severing war,<br>
Even where my slumbering form, buried in death,<br>
Coldly shall drink the life blood of my foes,<br>
If Zeus be Zeus, and his son Phoebus true.<br>
I would not speak aloud of mysteries.<br>
Then let me leave where I began. Preserve<br>
Thine own good faith, and thou shalt never say,<br>

Is mighty,—none in Hellas mightier,—<br>
That know I well. But I am sent to bring<br>
By fair persuasion to our Theban plain<br>
The reverend form of him now present here.<br>

Invite thee with one voice unto thy home,<br>

Aged and miserable, unhoused, unfed,<br>
Singly attended by this girl, whose fall<br>
To such a depth of undeservèd woe<br>
I could not have imagined! Hapless maid!<br>
Evermore caring for thy poor blind head,<br>
Roving in beggary, so young, with no man<br>
To marry her,—a mark for all mischance.<br>
O misery, what deep reproach I have laid<br>
On thee and me and our whole ill-starred race!<br>
But who can hide evil that courts the day?<br>
Thou, therefore, Oedipus, without constraint,<br>
(By all the Gods of Cadmus’ race I pray thee)<br>
Remove this horror from the sight of men<br>
By coming to the ancestral city and home<br>
Of thy great sires,—bidding a kind farewell<br>
To worthiest Athens, as is meet. But Thebes,<br>
Thy native land, yet more deserves thy love.</p>

For every cause the semblance of a plea<br>
Pranked up with righteous seeming, why again<br>

To catch me where I most were grieved being caught?<br>
Beforetime, when my self-procurèd woes<br>
Were plaguing me, and I would fain have rushed<br>
To instant banishment, thou wouldst not then<br>
Grant this indulgence to my keen desire.<br>
But when I had fed my passion to the full,<br>
And all my pleasure was to live at home,<br>
Then ’twas thy cue to expel and banish me,<br>
Nor was this name of kindred then so dear.<br>
Now once again, when thou behold’st this city<br>

Kind in pretence, but really full of evil.<br>

Your Thebè may come off untouched of harm<br>
From her encounter with Athenian men.<br>
Ye shall not have me thus. But you shall have<br>
My vengeful spirit ever in your land<br>
Abiding for destruction,—and my sons<br>
Shall have this portion in their father’s ground,<br>
To die thereon. Know I not things in Thebes<br>
Better than thou? Yea, for ’tis mine to hear<br>
Safer intelligencers,—Zeus himself,<br>

Sharpened with insolence;—but in shrewd speech<br>

Even were my cause most righteous, have presumed,<br>
Without consent of him who bore chief sway,<br>
To seize on any man, but would have known<br>
How men should act who tread on foreign soil.<br>
Thou bring’st disgrace on thine own mother state<br>
All undeservedly, and the lapse of years<br>
Hath left thee aged, but not wise—Again<br>
I bid those maids now to be brought with speed,<br>

Not as misprising this thy city’s strength<br>
In arms, or wisdom in debate, I dared<br>
This capture, but in simple confidence<br>
Thy citizens would not so envy me<br>
My blood relations, as to harbour them<br>
Against my will,—nor welcome to their hearths<br>
A man incestuous and a parricide,<br>
The proved defiler of his mother’s bed<br>
Such was the mount of Ares that I knew,<br>
Seat of high wisdom, planted in their soil,<br>
That suffers no such lawless runaways<br>
To haunt within the borders of your realm.<br>
Relying on that I laid my hands upon<br>
This quarry, nor had done so, were it not<br>

O boldness void of shame! Whom dost thou think<br>
Thy obloquy most harms, this agèd head<br>
Or thine, who hast thus let pass thy lips the crimes<br>
I have borne unwittingly. So Heaven was pleased<br>
To wreak some old offence upon our race.<br>
Since in myself you will find no stain of sin<br>
For which such ruinous error ’gainst myself<br>
And mine own house might be the recompense.<br>
Tell me, I pray thee, if a word from Heaven<br>
Came to my father through the oracle<br>
That he should die by his son’s hand,—what right<br>
Hast thou to fasten that reproach on me,<br>
The child not yet begotten of my sire,<br>
An unborn nothing, unconceived? Or if,<br>
Born as I was to misery, I encountered<br>
And killed my father in an angry fray,<br>
Nought knowing of what I did or whom I slew,<br>
What reason is’t to blame the unwitting deed?<br>
And, oh, thou wretch! art not ashamed to force me<br>
To speak that of my mother, thine own sister,<br>
Which I will speak, for I will not keep silence,<br>
Since thou hast been thus impious with thy tongue.<br>
She was my mother, oh, the bitter word!<br>
Though neither knew it, and having borne me, she<br>
Became the mother of children to her son,<br>
An infamous birth! Yet this I know, thy crime<br>
Of speech against us both is voluntary.<br>
But all involuntary was my deed<br>
In marriage and is this mine utterance now.<br>
No,—that shall not be called a bosom-sin,<br>
Nor shall my name be sullied with the deed,<br>
Thy tongue would brand on me, against my sire.<br>
For answer me one question. If to-day,<br>
Here, now, one struck at thee a murderous stroke,—<br>
At thee, the righteous person,—wouldst thou ask<br>

If such assailant were thy sire, or strike<br>
Forthwith? Methinks, as one who cares to live,<br>
You would strike before you questioned of the right,<br>
Or reasoned of his kindred whom you slew.<br>
Such was the net that snared me: such the woes<br>
Heaven drew me to fulfil. My father’s spirit,<br>
Came he to life, would not gainsay my word.<br>
But thou, to whom, beneath the garb of right,<br>
No matter is too dreadful or too deep<br>
For words, so rail’st on me, in such a presence.<br>
Well thou dost flatter the great name of Theseus,<br>
And Athens in her glory stablished here,<br>
But midst thy fulsome praises thou forgettest<br>
How of all lands that yield the immortal Gods<br>
Just homage of true piety, this land<br>
Is foremost. Yet from hence thou would’st beguile<br>
Me, the aged suppliant. Nay, from hence thou would’st drag<br>
Myself with violence, and hast reft away<br>
My children. Wherefore I conjure these powers,<br>
With solemn invocation and appeal,<br>
To come and take my part, that thou may’st know<br>

My father, to forgive me, ere I go<br>
To be revenged upon my brother there<br>
Who drave me forth and robbed me of my throne.<br>
If aught in prophecy deserves belief,<br>
’Tis certain, whom thou favourest, those shall win.<br>
Now by the wells whereof our fathers drank<br>
And by the Gods they worshipped, hear our prayer,<br>
Grant this petition: since alike in woe,<br>
Alike in poverty and banishment,<br>
Partakers of one destiny, thou and I<br>
Cringe to the stranger for a dwelling place.<br>
Whilst he at home, the tyrant, woe is me,<br>
Laughs at us both in soft luxurious pride.<br>
Whose might, so thou wilt favour my design,<br>
I will lightly scatter in one little hour;<br>
And plant thee in thy Theban palace home<br>
Near to myself, hurling the usurper forth.<br>
All this with thy consent I shall achieve,<br>
But without thee, I forfeit life and all.</p>

Ay, were it not the lord of all this land<br>
Theseus, that brought him to me and desired<br>
He might hear words from me,—never again<br>
Had these tones fallen upon his ear. But now<br>
That boon is granted him: he shall obtain,<br>
Ere he depart, such utterance of my tongue,<br>
As ne’er shall give him joy,—ne’er comfort thee,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 301]</span><span class="linenum">[1354-1390]</span>
Villain, who when possessed of the chief power<br>
Which now thy brother holds o’er Theban land,<br>
Didst banish me, thy father, who stand here,<br>
To live in exile, clothed with such attire,<br>
That moves thy tears now that thine own estate<br>
Is fallen into like depth of struggling woe.<br>
But tears are bootless. Howsoe’er I live,<br>
I must endure, and hold thee still my murderer.<br>
’Tis thou hast girt me round with misery,<br>
’Tis thou didst drive me forth, and driven by thee<br>
I beg my bread, a wandering sojourner.<br>
Yea, had these daughters not been born to me<br>
To tend me, I were dead, for all thou hast done.<br>
They have rescued, they have nursed me. They are men,<br>
Not women, in the strength of ministry.<br>
Ye are another’s, not my sons—For this<br>
The eye of Destiny pursues thee still<br>
Eager to light on thee with instant doom<br>
If once that army move toward the town<br>
Of ancient Thebes,—the <i>town</i>, no dearer name,<br>
‘City’ or ‘Country’ shall beseem thy lip<br>
Till ye both fall, stained with fraternal gore<br>
Long since I launched that curse against you twain<br>
Which here again I summon to mine aid,<br>

To a parent, nor account it a light thing<br>
That ye were cruel sons to your blind sire.<br>
These maidens did not so. Wherefore my curse<br>
Prevails against thy prayer for Thebe’s throne,<br>
If ancient Zeus, the eternal lawgiver,<br>
Have primal Justice for his counsellor.<br>
Begone, renounced and fatherless for me,<br>
And take with thee, vilest of villanous men,<br>
This imprecation:—Vain be thine attempt<br>
In levying war against thy father’s race,<br>
Frustrate be thy return to Argos’ vale:<br>
Die foully by a fratricidal hand<br>
And foully slay him who hath banished thee!<br>

Craves no brief speech, nor was the action brief.</p>

Then he is gone! Poor man!</p>

Ay, there is the main marvel. How he moved<br>
From hence, thou knowest, for thou too wert here,<br>
And saw’st that of his friends none guided him,<br>
But he they loved was leader to them all.<br>
Now, when he came to the steep pavement, rooted<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 308]</span><span class="linenum">[1591-1628]</span>
With adamant foundation deep in Earth,<br>
On one of many paths he took his stand<br>
Near the stone basin, where Peirithoüs<br>
And Theseus graved their everlasting league.<br>
There, opposite the mass of Laurian ore,<br>
Turned from the hollow pear-tree and the tomb<br>
Of marble, he sate down, and straight undid<br>
His travel-soiled attire, then called aloud<br>
On both his children, and bade some one fetch<br>
Pure water from a running stream. And they,<br>
Hasting together to the neighbouring hill<br>
Of green Demeter, goddess of the Spring,<br>
Brought back their sire’s commission speedily,<br>
And bathed, and clothed him with the sacred robe.<br>
When he was satisfied, and nothing now<br>
Remained undone of all he bade them do,<br>
The God of darkness thundered, and the maids<br>
Stood horror-stricken on hearing; then together<br>
Fell at their father’s knees and wept and wailed<br>
Loudly and long with beating of the breast.<br>
He, when that sound of sorrow pierced his ear,<br>
Caressed them in his arms and said:—‘My daughters,<br>
From this day forth you have no more a father.<br>
All that was mine is ended, and no longer<br>
Shall ye continue your hard ministry<br>
Of labour for my life.—And yet, though hard,<br>
Not unendurable, since all the toil<br>
Was rendered light through love, which ye can never<br>
Receive on earth so richly, as from him<br>
Bereaved of whom ye now shall live forlorn.’<br>
Such was the talk, mingled with sobs and crying,<br>
As each clung fast to each. But when they came<br>
To an end of weeping and those sounds were stilled,<br>
First all was silent; then a sudden voice<br>
Hurried him onward, making each man’s hair<br>
Bristle on end with force of instant fear.<br>
Now here, now there, not once but oftentimes,<br>
A God called loudly, ‘Oedipus, Oedipus!<br>
Why thus delay our going? This long while<br>
We are stayed for and thou tarriest. Come away!’<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 309]</span><span class="linenum">[1629-1666]</span>
He, when he knew the summons of the God,<br>
Gave word for royal Theseus to go near;<br>
And when he came, said: ‘Friend for ever kind,<br>
Reach thy right hand, I pray thee (that first pledge)<br>
To these my children:—daughters, yours to him!—<br>
And give thy sacred word that thou wilt never<br>
Betray these willingly: but still perform<br>
All that thou mayest with true thought for their good.’<br>
He, with grand calmness like his noble self,<br>
Promised on oath to keep this friendly bond.<br>
And when he had done so, Oedipus forthwith<br>
Stroking his children with his helpless hands<br>
Spake thus:—‘My daughters, you must steel your hearts<br>
To noble firmness, and depart from hence,<br>
Nor ask to see or hear forbidden things.<br>
Go, go at once! Theseus alone must stay<br>
Sole rightful witness of these mysteries.’<br>
Those accents were the last we all might hear.<br>
Then, following the two maids, with checkless tears<br>
And groans we took our way. But by and by,<br>
At distance looking round, we saw,—not him,<br>
Who was not there,—but Theseus all alone<br>
Holding his hand before his eyes, as if<br>
Some apparition unendurable<br>
Had dazed his vision. In a little while,<br>
We marked him making reverence in one prayer<br>
To the Earth, and to the home of Gods on high.<br>
But by what fate He perished, mortal man,<br>
Save Theseus, none can say. No lightning-flash<br>
From heaven, no tempest rising from the deep,<br>
Caused his departure in that hour, but either<br>
Some messenger from heaven, or, from beneath,<br>
The lower part of Earth, where comes no pain,<br>
Opening kindly to receive him in.<br>
Not to be mourned, nor with a tearful end<br>
Of sickness was he taken from the Earth,<br>
But wondrously, beyond recorded fate.<br>
If any deem my words unwise, I care not<br>
In that man’s judgement to be counted wise.</p>

Say, for what end?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
<span class="in16">Desire possesses me—</span></p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ISM.</span>
Whereof?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
To see the darksome dwelling-place—</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ISM.</span>
Of whom?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
<span class="in8">Woe is me! Of him, our sire!</span></p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ISM.</span>
<span class="in30">But how</span><br>
Can this be lawful? Seest thou not?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
<span class="in20">How say’st thou?</span><br>
Why this remonstrance?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ISM.</span>
<span class="in12">Seest thou not, again,</span><br>
He hath no grave and no man buried him.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
Take me but where he lies. Then slay me there.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ISM.</span>
Ah! woe is me, doubly unfortunate,<br>
Forlorn and destitute, whither henceforth<br>
For wretched comfort must we go?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
<span class="in22">Fear nought,</span><br>
Dear maidens!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ISM.</span>
<span class="in6">Where shall we find refuge?</span></p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
<span class="in30">Here,</span><br>
Long since, your refuge is secure.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
<span class="in18">How so?</span></p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
No harm shall touch you.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
<span class="in18">I know that.</span></p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="dpgn">[page 312]</span><span class="linenum">[1741-1778]</span>
<span class="cnm">CH.</span>
<span class="in30">What then</span><br>
Further engrosseth thee?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
<span class="in12">How to get home</span><br>
I know not.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
<span class="in4">Seek not for it.</span></p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
<span class="in14">Weariness</span><br>
O’erweighs me.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
<span class="in6">Hath it not before oppressed thee?</span></p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
Before, it vexed me; now it overwhelms.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
A mighty sea of misery is your lot.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
Woe is me! O Zeus! And whither must we go?<br>
Unto what doom doth my Fate drive me now?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
Children, lament no longer. ’Tis not well<br>
To mourn ’mongst those with whom the honoured dead<br>
Hath left the heirloom of his benison.</p>
<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">THESEUS</span>.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
Theseus, behold us falling at thy feet.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">THE.</span>
What boon, my children, are ye bent to obtain?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
Our eyes would see our father’s burial-place.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">THE.</span>
’Tis not permitted to go near that spot.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
O Athens’ sovereign lord, what hast thou said?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">THE.</span>
Dear children, ’twas your father’s spoken will<br>
That no man should approach his resting-place,<br>
Nor human voice should ever violate<br>
The mystery of the tomb wherein he lies.<br>
He promised, if I truly kept this word,<br>
My land would evermore be free from harm.<br>
The power which no man may transgress and live,<br>
The oath of Zeus, bore witness to our troth.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
His wishes are enough. Then, pray thee, send<br>
An escort to convey us to our home,<br>
Primeval Thebes, if so we may prevent<br>
The death that menaces our brethren there.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">THE.</span>
That will I; and in all that I may do<br>
To prosper you and solace him beneath,—<br>
Who even now passes to eternity,—<br>
I must not falter. Come, lament no more.<br>
His destiny hath found a perfect end.</p>
