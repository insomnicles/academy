<p class="break"><span class="page2">[page 2]</span>
Polynices, son and heir to the unfortunate Oedipus,
having been supplanted by his younger brother Eteocles,
brought an army of Argives against his native city, Thebes.
The army was defeated, and the two brothers slew each
other in single combat. On this Creon, the brother-in-law
of Oedipus, succeeding to the chief power, forbade the
burial of Polynices. But Antigone, sister of the dead,
placing the dues of affection and piety before her obligation
to the magistrate, disobeyed the edict at the sacrifice of her
life. Creon carried out his will, but lost his son Haemon and
his wife Eurydice, and received their curses on his head.
His other son, Megareus, had previously been devoted as
a victim to the good of the state.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANTIGONE.</span>
Own sister of my blood, one life with me,<br>
Ismenè, have the tidings caught thine ear?<br>
Say, hath not Heaven decreed to execute<br>
On thee and me, while yet we are alive,<br>
All the evil Oedipus bequeathed? All horror,<br>
All pain, all outrage, falls on us! And now<br>
The General’s proclamation of to-day—<br>
Hast thou not heard?—Art thou so slow to hear<br>
When harm from foes threatens the souls we love?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ISMENE.</span>
No word of those we love, Antigone,<br>
Painful or glad, hath reached me, since we two<br>
Were utterly deprived of our two brothers,<br>
Cut off with mutual stroke, both in one day.<br>
And since the Argive host this now-past night<br>
Is vanished, I know nought beside to make me<br>
Nearer to happiness or more in woe.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
I knew it well, and therefore led thee forth<br>
The palace gate, that thou alone mightst hear.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ISM.</span>
Speak on! Thy troubled look bodes some dark news.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
Why, hath not Creon, in the burial-rite,<br>
Of our two brethren honoured one, and wrought<br>
On one foul wrong? Eteocles, they tell,<br>
With lawful consecration he lays out,<br>
And after covers him in earth, adorned<br>
With amplest honours in the world below.<br>
But Polynices, miserably slain,<br>
They say ’tis publicly proclaimed that none<br>
Must cover in a grave, nor mourn for him;<br>
But leave him tombless and unwept, a store<br>
Of sweet provision for the carrion fowl<br>
That eye him greedily. Such righteous law<br>
Good Creon hath pronounced for thy behoof—<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 4]</span><span class="linenum">[32-65]</span>
Ay, and for mine! I am not left out!—And now<br>
He moves this way to promulgate his will<br>
To such as have not heard, nor lightly holds<br>
The thing he bids, but, whoso disobeys,<br>
The citizens shall stone him to the death.<br>
This is the matter, and thou wilt quickly show<br>
If thou art noble, or fallen below thy birth.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ISM.</span>
Unhappy one! But what can I herein<br>
Avail to do or undo?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
<span class="in10">Wilt thou share</span><br>
The danger and the labour? Make thy choice.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ISM.</span>
Of what wild enterprise? What canst thou mean?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
Wilt thou join hand with mine to lift the dead?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ISM.</span>
Ah, sister, think but how our father fell,<br>
Hated of all and lost to fair renown,<br>
Through self-detected crimes—with his own hand,<br>
Self-wreaking, how he dashed out both his eyes:<br>
Then how the mother-wife, sad two-fold name!<br>
With twisted halter bruised her life away,<br>
Last, how in one dire moment our two brothers<br>
With internecine conflict at a blow<br>
Wrought out by fratricide their mutual doom.<br>
Now, left alone, O think how beyond all<br>
Most piteously we twain shall be destroyed,<br>
If in defiance of authority<br>
We traverse the commandment of the King!<br>
We needs must bear in mind we are but women,<br>
Never created to contend with men;<br>
Nay more, made victims of resistless power,<br>
To obey behests more harsh than this to-day.<br>
I, then, imploring those beneath to grant<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 5]</span><span class="linenum">[66-99]</span>
Indulgence, seeing I am enforced in this,<br>
Will yield submission to the powers that rule,<br>
Small wisdom were it to overpass the bound.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
I will not urge you! no! nor if now you list<br>
To help me, will your help afford me joy.<br>
Be what you choose to be! This single hand<br>
Shall bury our lost brother. Glorious<br>
For me to take this labour and to die!<br>
Dear to him will my soul be as we rest<br>
In death, when I have dared this holy crime.<br>
My time for pleasing men will soon be over;<br>
Not so my duty toward the Dead! My home<br>
Yonder will have no end. You, if you will,<br>
May pour contempt on laws revered on High.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ISM.</span>
Not from irreverence. But I have no strength<br>
To strive against the citizens’ resolve.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
Thou, make excuses! I will go my way<br>
To raise a burial-mound to my dear brother.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ISM.</span>
Oh, hapless maiden, how I fear for thee!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
Waste not your fears on me! Guide your own fortune.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ISM.</span>
Ah! yet divulge thine enterprise to none,<br>
But keep the secret close, and so will I.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
O Heavens! Nay, tell! I hate your silence worse;<br>
I had rather you proclaimed it to the world.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ISM.</span>
You are ardent in a chilling enterprise.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
I know that I please those whom I would please.</p>

Yes, if you thrive; but your desire is bootless.</p>

Well, when I fail I shall be stopt, I trow!</p>

One should not start upon a hopeless quest.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ANT.</span>
Speak in that vein if you would earn my hate<br>
And aye be hated of our lost one. Peace!<br>
Leave my unwisdom to endure this peril;<br>
Fate cannot rob me of a noble death.</p>

My friends, the noble vessel of our State,<br>
After sore shaking her, the Gods have sped<br>
On a smooth course once more. I have called you hither,<br>
By special messengers selecting you<br>
From all the city, first, because I knew you<br>
Aye loyal to the throne of Laïus;<br>
Then, both while Oedipus gave prosperous days,<br>
And since his fall, I still beheld you firm<br>
In sound allegiance to the royal issue.<br>
Now since the pair have perished in an hour,<br>
Twinned in misfortune, by a mutual stroke<br>
Staining our land with fratricidal blood,<br>
All rule and potency of sovereign sway,<br>
In virtue of next kin to the deceased,<br>
Devolves on me. But hard it is to learn<br>
The mind of any mortal or the heart,<br>
Till he be tried in chief authority.<br>
Power shows the man. For he who when supreme<br>
Withholds his hand or voice from the best cause,<br>
Being thwarted by some fear, that man to me<br>
Appears, and ever hath appeared, most vile.<br>
He too hath no high place in mine esteem,<br>
Who sets his friend before his fatherland.<br>
Let Zeus whose eye sees all eternally<br>
Be here my witness. I will ne’er keep silence<br>
When danger lours upon my citizens<br>
Who looked for safety, nor make him my friend<br>
Who doth not love my country. For I know<br>
Our country carries us, and whilst her helm<br>
Is held aright we gain good friends and true.<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 9]</span><span class="linenum">[191-225]</span>
<span class="in2">Following such courses ’tis my steadfast will</span><br>
To foster Thebè’s greatness, and therewith<br>
In brotherly accord is my decree<br>
Touching the sons of Oedipus. The man—<br>
Eteocles I mean—who died for Thebes<br>
Fighting with eminent prowess on her side,<br>
Shall be entombed with every sacred rite<br>
That follows to the grave the lordliest dead.<br>
But for his brother, who, a banished man,<br>
Returned to devastate and burn with fire<br>
The land of his nativity, the shrines<br>
Of his ancestral gods, to feed him fat<br>
With Theban carnage, and make captive all<br>
That should escape the sword—for Polynices,<br>
This law hath been proclaimed concerning him:<br>
He shall have no lament, no funeral,<br>
But he unburied, for the carrion fowl<br>
And dogs to eat his corse, a sight of shame.<br>
<span class="in2">Such are the motions of this mind and will.</span><br>
Never from me shall villains reap renown<br>
Before the just. But whoso loves the State,<br>
I will exalt him both in life and death.</p>

Cried halt unto me ever as I came<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 10]</span><span class="linenum">[226-257]</span>
And wheeled me to return. My mind discoursed<br>
Most volubly within my breast, and said—<br>
Fond wretch! why go where thou wilt find thy bane?<br>
Unhappy wight! say, wilt thou bide aloof?<br>
Then if the king shall hear this from another,<br>
How shalt thou ’scape for ’t? Winding thus about<br>
I hasted, but I could not speed, and so<br>
Made a long journey of a little way.<br>
At last ‘yes’ carried it, that I should come<br>
To thee; and tell thee I must needs; and shall,<br>
Though it be nothing that I have to tell.<br>
For I came hither, holding fast by this—<br>
Nought that is not my fate can happen to me.</p>

No dint of spade, or mattock-loosened sod,—<br>
Only the hard bare ground, untilled and trackless.<br>
Whoe’er he was, the doer left no trace.<br>
And, when the scout of our first daylight watch<br>
Showed us the thing, we marvelled in dismay.<br>
The Prince was out of sight; not in a grave,<br>
But a thin dust was o’er him, as if thrown<br>
By one who shunned the dead man’s curse. No sign<br>
Appeared of any hound or beast o’ the field<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 11]</span><span class="linenum">[258-295]</span>
Having come near, or pulled at the dead body.<br>
Then rose high words among us sentinels<br>
With bickering noise accusing each his mate,<br>
And it seemed like to come to blows, with none<br>
To hinder. For the hand that thus had wrought<br>
Was any of ours, and none; the guilty man<br>
Escaped all knowledge. And we were prepared<br>
To lift hot iron with our bare palms; to walk<br>
Through fire, and swear by all the Gods at once<br>
That we were guiltless, ay, and ignorant<br>
Of who had plotted or performed this thing.<br>
<span class="in2">When further search seemed bootless, at the last</span><br>
One spake, whose words bowed all our heads to the earth<br>
With fear. We knew not what to answer him,<br>
Nor how to do it and prosper. He advised<br>
So grave a matter must not be concealed,<br>
But instantly reported to the King.<br>
<span class="in2">Well, this prevailed, and the lot fell on me,</span><br>
Unlucky man! to be the ministrant<br>
Of this fair service. So I am present here,<br>
Against my will and yours, I am sure of that.<br>
None love the bringer of unwelcome news.</p>

My lord, a thought keeps whispering in my breast,<br>
Some Power divine hath interposed in this.</p>

Cease, ere thou quite enrage me, and appear<br>
Foolish as thou art old. Talk not to me<br>
Of Gods who have taken thought for this dead man!<br>
Say, was it for his benefits to them<br>
They hid his corse, and honoured him so highly,<br>
Who came to set on fire their pillared shrines,<br>
With all the riches of their offerings,<br>
And to make nothing of their land and laws?<br>
Or, hast thou seen them honouring villany?<br>
That cannot be. Long time the cause of this<br>
Hath come to me in secret murmurings<br>
From malcontents of Thebes, who under yoke<br>
Turned restive, and would not accept my sway.<br>
Well know I, these have bribed the watchmen here<br>
To do this for some fee. For nought hath grown<br>

Current among mankind so mischievous<br>
As money. This brings cities to their fall:<br>
This drives men homeless, and moves honest minds<br>
To base contrivings. This hath taught mankind<br>
The use of wickedness, and how to give<br>
An impious turn to every kind of act.<br>
But whosoe’er hath done this for reward<br>
Hath found his way at length to punishment.<br>
If Zeus have still my worship, be assured<br>
Of that which here on oath I say to thee—<br>
Unless ye find the man who made this grave<br>
And bring him bodily before mine eye,<br>
Death shall not be enough, till ye have hung<br>
Alive for an example of your guilt,<br>
That henceforth in your rapine ye may know<br>
Whence gain is to be gotten, and may learn<br>
Pelf from all quarters is not to be loved.<br>
For in base getting, ’tis a common proof,<br>
More find disaster than deliverance.</p>

My lord, no mortal should deny on oath,<br>
Judgement is still belied by after thought<br>

Methought no force would drive me to this place<br>
But joy unlook’d for and surpassing hope<br>
Is out of bound the best of all delight,<br>
And so I am here again,—though I had sworn<br>

Caught in the act of caring for the dead<br>
Here was no lot throwing, this hap was mine<br>

And how was she detected, caught, and taken?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">WATCH.</span>
It fell in this wise. We were come to the spot,<br>
Bearing the dreadful burden of thy threats;<br>
And first with care we swept the dust away<br>
From round the corse, and laid the dank limbs bare:<br>
Then sate below the hill-top, out o’ the wind,<br>
Where no bad odour from the dead might strike us,<br>
Stirring each other on with interchange<br>
Of loud revilings on the negligent<br>
In ’tendance on this duty. So we stayed<br>
Till in mid heaven the sun’s resplendent orb<br>
Stood high, and the heat strengthened. Suddenly,<br>
The Storm-god raised a whirlwind from the ground,<br>
Vexing heaven’s concave, and filled all the plain,<br>
Rending the locks of all the orchard groves,<br>
Till the great sky was choked withal. We closed<br>
Our lips and eyes, and bore the God-sent evil.<br>
When after a long while this ceased, the maid<br>
Was seen, and wailed in high and bitter key,<br>
Like some despairing bird that hath espied<br>
Her nest all desolate, the nestlings gone.<br>
So, when she saw the body bare, she mourned<br>
Loudly, and cursed the authors of this deed.<br>
Then nimbly with her hands she brought dry dust,<br>
And holding high a shapely brazen cruse,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 16]</span><span class="linenum">[431-467]</span>
Poured three libations, honouring the dead.<br>
We, when we saw, ran in, and straightway seized<br>
Our quarry, nought dismayed, and charged her with<br>
The former crime and this. And she denied<br>
Nothing;—to my delight, and to my grief.<br>
One’s self to escape disaster is great joy;<br>
Yet to have drawn a friend into distress<br>
Is painful. But mine own security<br>
To me is of more value than aught else.</p>

I heard it not from Heaven, nor came it forth<br>
From Justice, where she reigns with Gods below.<br>
They too have published to mankind a law.<br>
Nor thought I thy commandment of such might<br>
That one who is mortal thus could overbear<br>
The infallible, unwritten laws of Heaven.<br>
Not now or yesterday they have their being,<br>
But everlastingly, and none can tell<br>
The hour that saw their birth. I would not, I,<br>
For any terror of a man’s resolve,<br>
Incur the God-inflicted penalty<br>
Of doing them wrong. That death would come, I knew<br>
Without thine edict;—if before the time,<br>
I count it gain. Who does not gain by death,<br>
That lives, as I do, amid boundless woe?<br>
Slight is the sorrow of such doom to me.<br>
But had I suffered my own mother’s child,<br>
Fallen in blood, to be without a grave,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 17]</span><span class="linenum">[468-503]</span>

And now I bid you call her. Late I saw her<br>
Within the house, beyond herself, and frantic.<br>

Ye men of Thebes, the tidings met mine ear<br>
As I was coming forth to visit Pallas<br>
With prayerful salutation. I was loosening<br>
The bar of the closed gate, when the sharp sound<br>
Of mine own sorrow smote against my heart,<br>
And I fell back astonied on my maids<br>
And fainted. But the tale? tell me once more;<br>
I am no novice in adversity.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">MESS.</span>
Dear lady, I will tell thee what I saw,<br>
And hide no grain of truth: why should I soothe<br>
Thy spirit with soft tales, when the harsh fact<br>
Must prove me a liar? Truth is always best.<br>
I duly led the footsteps of thy lord<br>
To the highest point of the plain, where still was lying,<br>
Forlorn and mangled by the dogs, the corse<br>
Of Polynices. We besought Persephonè<br>
And Pluto gently to restrain their wrath,<br>
And wash’d him pure and clean, and then we burned<br>
The poor remains with brushwood freshly pulled,<br>
And heaped a lofty mound of his own earth<br>
Above him. Then we turned us to the vault,<br>
The maiden’s stony bride-chamber of death.<br>
And from afar, round the unhallowed cell,<br>
One heard a voice of wailing loud and long,<br>
And went and told his lord: who coming near<br>
Was haunted by the dim and bitter cry,<br>
And suddenly exclaiming on his fate<br>
Said lamentably, ‘My prophetic heart<br>
Divined aright. I am going, of all ways<br>
That e’er I went, the unhappiest to-day.<br>
My son’s voice smites me. Go, my men, approach<br>
With speed, and, where the stones are torn away,<br>
Press through the passage to that door of death,<br>
Look hard, and tell me, if I hear aright<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 37]</span><span class="linenum">[1218-1252]</span>
The voice of Haemon, or the gods deceive me.’<br>
Thus urged by our despairing lord, we made<br>
Th’ espial. And in the farthest nook of the vault<br>
We saw the maiden hanging by the neck<br>
With noose of finest tissue firmly tied,<br>
And clinging to her on his knees the boy,<br>
Lamenting o’er his ruined nuptial-rite,<br>
Consummated in death, his father’s crime<br>
And his lost love. And when the father saw him,<br>
With loud and dreadful clamour bursting in<br>
He went to him and called him piteously:<br>
‘What deed is this, unhappy youth? What thought<br>
O’ermaster’d thee? Where did the force of woe<br>
O’erturn thy reason? O come forth, my son,<br>
I beg thee!’ But with savage eyes the youth<br>
Glared scowling at him, and without a word<br>
Plucked forth his two-edged blade. The father then<br>
Fled and escaped: but the unhappy boy,<br>
Wroth with himself, even where he stood, leant heavily<br>
Upon his sword and plunged it in his side.—<br>
And while the sense remained, his slackening arm<br>
Enfolded still the maiden, and his breath,<br>
Gaspingly drawn and panted forth with pain,<br>
Cast ruddy drops upon her pallid face;<br>
Then lay in death upon the dead, at last<br>
Joined to his bride in Hades’ dismal hall:—<br>
A monument unto mankind, that rashness<br>
Is the worst evil of this mortal state.<span class="sdr"><span class="cnm">[</span>Exit <span class="cnm">EURYDICE</span></span></p>
