<p class="lftbrk">SCENE. A desert shore of the Island of Lemnos.</p>
<p class="break"><span class="page2">[page 216]</span>
It was fated that Troy should be taken by Neoptolemus,
the son of Achilles, assisted by the bow of Heracles in the
hands of Philoctetes.</p>
<p>Now Philoctetes had been rejected by the army because of
a trouble in his foot, which made his presence with them
insufferable; and had been cast away by Odysseus on the
island of Lemnos.</p>
<p>But when the decree of fate was revealed by prophecy,
Odysseus undertook to bring Philoctetes back, and took
with him Neoptolemus, whose ambition could only be
gratified through the return of Philoctetes with the bow.</p>
<p>Philoctetes was resolutely set against returning, and at
the opening of the drama Neoptolemus is persuaded by
Odysseus to take him with guile.</p>
<p>But when Philoctetes appears, the youth’s ingenuous
nature is so wrought upon through pity and remorse, that
his sympathy and native truthfulness at length overcome
his ambition.</p>
<p>When the inward sacrifice is complete, Heracles appears
from heaven, and by a few words changes the mind of
Philoctetes, so that all ends well.</p>

<h3>PHILOCTETES</h3>
<p class="sdn"><span class="cnm">ODYSSEUS. NEOPTOLEMUS.</span></p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">ODYSSEUS.</span>
This coast of sea-girt Lemnos, where we stand,<br>
Is uninhabited, untrodden of men.<br>
And here, O noble son of noblest sire,<br>
Achilles-born Neoptolemus, I erewhile,—<br>
Ordered by those who had command,—cast forth<br>
Trachinian Philoctetes, Poeas’ son,<br>
His foot dark-dripping with a rankling wound;<br>
When with wild cries, that frighted holy rest,<br>
Filling the camp, he troubled every rite,<br>
That none might handle sacrifice, or pour<br>
Wine-offering, but his noise disturbed our peace.<br>
<span class="in2">But why these words? No moment this for talk,</span><br>
Lest he discern my coming, and I lose<br>
The scheme, wherewith I think to catch him soon.<br>
Now most behoves thy service, to explore<br>
This headland for a cave with double mouth,<br>
Whose twofold aperture, on wintry days,<br>
Gives choice of sunshine, and in summer noons<br>
The breeze wafts slumber through the airy cell.<br>
Then, something lower down, upon the left,<br>
Unless ’tis dried, thine eye may note a spring.<br>
Go near now silently, and make me know<br>
If still he persevere, and hold this spot,<br>
Or have roamed elsewhere, that informed of this<br>
I may proceed with what remains to say,<br>
And we may act in concert.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEOPTOLEMUS.</span>
<span class="in4">Lord Odysseus,</span><br>
Thy foremost errand will not task me far.<br>
Methinks I see the cave whereof thou speakest.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
Where? let me see it. Above there, or below?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="dpgn">[page 218]</span><span class="linenum">[29-64]</span></p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Yonder, above. And yet I hear no tread.<br>
<span class="sdr"><span class="cnm">[</span><span class="cnm">NEOPTOLEMUS</span> climbs up to the cave</span><br></p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
Look if he be not lodged in slumber there.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
I find no inmate, but an empty room.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
What? no provision for a dwelling-place?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
A bed of leaves for some one harbouring here.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
Nought else beneath the roof? Is all forlorn?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
A cup of wood, some untaught craftsman’s skill,<br>
And, close at hand, these embers of a fire.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
That store is his. I read the token clear.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Oh! and these festering rags give evidence,<br>
Steeped as with dressing some malignant sore.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
The man inhabits here: I know it now.<br>
And sure he’s not far off. How can he range,<br>
Whose limb drags heavy with an ancient harm?<br>
But he’s gone, either to bring forage home,<br>
Or where he hath found some plant of healing power.<br>
Send therefore thine attendant to look forth,<br>
Lest unawares he find me. All our host<br>
Were not so fair a prize for him as I.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
My man is going, and shall watch the path.<br>
What more dost thou require of me? Speak on.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
Son of Achilles, know that thou art come<br>
To serve us nobly, not with strength alone,<br>
But, faithful to thy mission, if so be,<br>
To do things strange, unwonted to thine ear.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
What dost thou bid me?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
<span class="in20">’Tis thy duty now</span><br>
To entrap the mind of Poeas’ son with words.<br>
When he shall ask thee, who and whence thou art,<br>
Declare thy name and father. ’Tis not that<br>
I charge thee to conceal. But for thy voyage,<br>
’Tis homeward, leaving the Achaean host,<br>
With perfect hatred hating them, because<br>
They who had drawn thee with strong prayers from home,<br>
Their hope for taking Troy, allowed thee not<br>
Thy just demand to have thy father’s arms,<br>
But, e’er thy coming, wrongly gave them o’er<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 219]</span><span class="linenum">[64-101]</span>
Unto Odysseus: and thereon launch forth<br>
With boundless execration against me.<br>
That will not pain me, but if thou reject<br>
This counsel, thou wilt trouble all our host,<br>
Since, if his bow shall not be ta’en, thy life<br>
Will ne’er be crowned through Troy’s discomfiture.<br>
<span class="in2">Now let me show, why thine approach to him</span><br>
Is safe and trustful as mine cannot be<br>
Thou didst sail forth, not to redeem thine oath,<br>
Nor by constraint, nor with the foremost band.<br>
All which reproaches I must bear: and he,<br>
But seeing me, while master of his bow,<br>
Will slay me, and my ruin will be thine.<br>
This point then craves our cunning, to acquire<br>
By subtle means the irresistible bow—<br>
Thy nature was not framed, I know it well,<br>
For speaking falsehood, or contriving harm.<br>
Yet, since the prize of victory is so dear,<br>
Endure it—We’ll be just another day<br>
But now, for one brief hour, devote thyself<br>
To serve me without shame, and then for aye<br>
Hereafter be the pearl of righteousness.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
The thing that, being named, revolts mine ear,<br>
Son of Laërtes, I abhor to do<br>
’Tis not my nature, no, nor, as they tell,<br>
My father’s, to work aught by craft and guile.<br>
I’ll undertake to bring him in by force,<br>
Not by deceit. For, sure, with his one foot,<br>
He cannot be a match for all our crew<br>
Being sent, my lord, to serve thee, I am loth<br>
To seem rebellious. But I rather choose<br>
To offend with honour, than to win by wrong.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
Son of a valiant sire, I, too, in youth,<br>
Had once a slow tongue and an active hand.<br>
But since I have proved the world, I clearly see<br>
Words and not deeds give mastery over men.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
What then is thy command? To lie? No more?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
To entangle Philoctetes with deceit.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="dpgn">[page 210]</span><span class="linenum">[102-134]</span>
<span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Why through deceit? May not persuasion fetch him?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
Never. And force as certainly will fail.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
What lends him such assurance of defence?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
Arrows, the unerring harbingers of Death.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Then to go near him is a perilous thing.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
Unless with subtlety, as I have said.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
And is not lying shameful to thy soul?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
Not if by lying I can save my soul.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
How must one look in speaking such a word?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
Where gain invites, this shrinking is not good.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
What gain I through his coming back to Troy?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
His arms alone have power to take Troy-town.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Then am not I the spoiler, as ye said?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
Thou without them, they without thee, are powerless.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
If it be so, they must be sought and won.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
Yea, for in this two prizes will be thine.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
What? When I learn them, I will not refuse.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
Wisdom and valour joined in one good name.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Shame, to the winds! Come, I will do this thing.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
Say, dost thou bear my bidding full in mind?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Doubt not, since once for all I have embraced it.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OD.</span>
Thou, then, await him here. I will retire,<br>
For fear my hated presence should be known,<br>
And take back our attendant to the ship.<br>
And then once more, should ye appear to waste<br>
The time unduly, I will send again<br>
This same man hither in disguise, transformed<br>
To the strange semblance of a merchantman;<br>
From dark suggestion of whose crafty tongue,<br>
Thou, O my son, shalt gather timely counsel.<br>
<span class="in2">Now to my ship. This charge I leave to thee.</span><br>
May secret Hermes guide us to our end,<br>
And civic Pallas, named of victory,<br>
The sure protectress of my devious way.</p>

That hungers now to hear your voices’ tune.<br>
Ah! do not fear me, do not shrink away<br>

Forlorn and desolate in nameless woe,<br>

But they, who pitilessly cast me forth,<br>
Keep silence and are glad, while this my plague<br>
Blooms ever, and is strengthened more and more.<br>
Boy, great Achilles’ offspring, in this form<br>
Thou seest the man, of whom, methinks, erewhile<br>
Thou hast been told, to whom the Hercúlean bow<br>
Descended, Philoctetes, Poeas’ son;<br>
Whom the two generals and the Ithacan king<br>
Cast out thus shamefully forlorn, afflicted<br>

Made by the cruel basilisk’s murderous tooth.<br>
With this for company they left me, child!<br>
Exposed upon this shore, deserted, lone.<br>
<span class="in2">From seaward Chrysa came they with their fleet</span><br>
And touched at Lemnos. I had fallen to rest<br>
From the long tossing, in a shadowy cave<br>
On yonder cliff by the shore. Gladly they saw,<br>
And left me, having set forth for my need,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 225]</span><span class="linenum">[273-314]</span>
Poor man, some scanty rags, and a thin store<br>
Of provender. Such food be theirs, I pray!<br>
Imagine, O my son, when they were gone,<br>
What wakening, what arising, then was mine;<br>
What weeping, what lamenting of my woe!<br>
When I beheld the ships, wherewith I sailed,<br>
Gone, one and all! and no man in the place,<br>
None to bestead me, none to comfort me<br>
In my sore sickness. And where’er I looked,<br>
Nought but distress was present with me still.<br>
No lack of that, for one thing!—Ah! my son,<br>
Time passed, and there I found myself alone<br>
Within my narrow lodging, forced to serve<br>
Each pressing need. For body’s sustenance<br>
This bow supplied me with sufficient store,<br>
Wounding the feathered doves, and when the shaft,<br>
From the tight string, had struck, myself, ay me!<br>
Dragging this foot, would crawl to my swift prey.<br>
Then water must be fetched, and in sharp frost<br>
Wood must be found and broken,—all by me.<br>
Nor would fire come unbidden, but with flint<br>
From flints striking dim sparks, I hammered forth<br>
The struggling flame that keeps the life in me.<br>
For houseroom with the single help of fire<br>
Gives all I need, save healing for my sore.<br>
<span class="in2">Now learn, my son, the nature of this isle.</span><br>
No mariner puts in here willingly.<br>
For it hath neither moorage, nor sea-port,<br>
For traffic or kind shelter or good cheer.<br>
Not hitherward do prudent men make voyage.<br>
Perchance one may have touched against his will.<br>
Many strange things may happen in long time.<br>
These, when they come, in words have pitied me,<br>
And given me food, or raiment, in compassion.<br>
But none is willing, when I speak thereof,<br>
To take me safely home. Wherefore I pine<br>
Now this tenth year, in famine and distress,<br>
Feeding the hunger of my ravenous plague.<br>

Odysseus and <a href="#Phil_n_2" id="Phil_t_2" class="pginternal">the fosterer of my sire,</a><br>
Saying, whether soothly, or in idle show,<br>
That, since my father perished, it was known<br>
None else but I should take Troy’s citadel.<br>
Such words from them, my friend, thou may’st believe,<br>
Held me not long from making voyage with speed,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 227]</span><span class="linenum">[350-385]</span>
Chiefly through longing for my father’s corse,<br>
To see him yet unburied,—<a href="#Phil_n_3" id="Phil_t_3" class="pginternal">for I ne’er<br>
Had seen him.</a> Then, besides, ’twas a fair cause,<br>
If, by my going, I should vanquish Troy.<br>
One day I had sailed, and on the second came<br>
To sad Sigeum with wind-favoured speed,<br>
When straightway all the host, surrounding me<br>
As I set foot on shore, saluted me,<br>
And swore the dead Achilles was in life,<br>
Their eyes being witness, when they looked on me.<br>
He lay there in his shroud: but I, unhappy,<br>
Soon ending lamentation for the dead,<br>
Went near to those Atridae, as to friends,<br>
To obtain my father’s armour and all else<br>
That had been his. And then,—alas the while,<br>
That men should be so hard!—they spake this word:<br>
‘Seed of Achilles, thou may’st freely take<br>
All else thy father owned, but for those arms,<br>
Another wields them now, Laërtes’ son.’<br>
Tears rushed into mine eyes, and in hot wrath<br>
I straightway rose, and bitterly outspake:<br>
‘O miscreant! What? And have ye dared to give<br>
Mine arms to some man else, unknown to me?’<br>
Then said Odysseus, for he chanced to be near,<br>
‘Yea, child, and justly have they given me these.<br>
I saved them and their master in the field.’<br>
Then in fierce anger all at once I launched<br>
All terms of execration at his head,<br>
Bating no word, being maddened by the thought<br>
That I should lose this heirloom,—and to him!<br>
He, at this pass, though not of wrathful mood,<br>
Stung by such utterance, made rejoinder thus:<br>
‘Thou wast not with us here, but wrongfully<br>
Didst bide afar. And, since thou mak’st so bold,<br>
I tell thee, never shalt thou, as thou sayest,<br>
Sail with these arms to Scyros.’—Thus reviled,<br>
With such an evil echo in mine ear,<br>
I voyage homeward, robbed of mine own right<br>
By that <a href="#Phil_n_4" id="Phil_t_4" class="pginternal">vile offset of an evil tree.</a><br>
Yet less I blame him than the men in power.<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 228]</span><span class="linenum">[386-423]</span>
For every multitude, be it army or state,<br>
Takes tone from those who rule it, and all taint<br>
Of disobedience from bad counsel springs.<br>
I have spoken. May the Atridae’s enemy<br>
Be dear to Heaven, as he is loved by me!</p>

Your coming is commended by a grief<br>
That makes you kindly welcome. For I feel<br>
A chord that vibrates to your voice, and tells,<br>
Thus have Odysseus and the Atridae wrought.<br>
Full well I know, Odysseus’ poisoned tongue<br>
Shrinks from no mischief nor no guileful word<br>
That leads to bad achievement in the end.<br>
This moves not my main marvel, but if one<br>
Saw this and bore it,—Aias of the shield.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Ah, friend, he was no more. Had he but lived,<br>

Yea, be assured, they live and flourish high<br>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
There, there! In one brief word thou hast revealed<br>
The mournful case of twain, whom I would last<br>
Have chosen to hear of as undone. Ah me!<br>
Where must one look? when these are dead, and he,<br>
Odysseus, lives,—and in a time like this,<br>
That craves their presence, and his death for theirs.</p>

Even ablest wits are ofttimes snared at last.</p>

Patroclus, whom thy father loved so well?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>

One truth for all. War doth not willingly<br>
Snatch off the wicked, but still takes the good.</p>

True! and to prove thy saying, I will inquire<br>

But ever shrewd and nimble with his tongue.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Whom but Odysseus canst thou mean by this?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
I meant not him. But there was one Thersites,<br>
Who ne’er made conscience to stint speech, where all<br>
Cried ‘Silence!’ Is he living, dost thou know?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
I saw him not, but knew he was alive.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
He must be: for no evil yet was crushed.<br>
The Heavens will ever shield it. ’Tis their sport<br>
To turn back all things rancorous and malign<br>
From going down to the grave, and send instead<br>
The good and true. Oh, how shall we commend<br>
Such dealings, how defend them? When I praise<br>
Things god-like, I find evil in the Gods.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
I, O thou child of a Trachinian sire,<br>
Henceforth will take good care, from far away<br>
To look on Troy and Atreus’ children twain.<br>
Yea, where the trickster lords it o’er the just,<br>
And goodness languishes and rascals rule,<br>
—Such courses I will nevermore endure.<br>
But rock-bound Scyros henceforth shall suffice<br>
To yield me full contentment in my home.<br>
Now, to my vessel! And thou, Poeas’ child,<br>

Farewell, right heartily farewell! May Heaven<br>

Suppliant I beg thee, leave me not thus lone,<br>
Forlorn in all my misery which thou seest,<br>
In all thou hast heard of here surrounding me!<br>
Stow me with other freightage. Full of care,<br>

Yet venture! Surely to the noble mind<br>
All shame is hateful and all kindness blest.<br>
And shame would be thy meed, didst thou fail here<br>
But, doing this, thou shalt have glorious fame,<br>
When I return alive to Oeta’s vale.<br>
Come, ’tis the labour not of one whole day.<br>
So thou durst take me, fling me where thou wilt<br>
O’ the ship, in hold, prow, stern, or wheresoe’er<br>
I least may trouble those on board with me.<br>
Ah! by great Zeus, the suppliant’s friend, comply,<br>
My son, be softened! See, where I am fall’n<br>
Thus on my knees before thee, though so weak,<br>
Crippled and powerless. Ah! forsake me not<br>
Thus far from human footstep. Take me, take me!<br>
If only to thy home, or to the town<br>
<a href="#Phil_n_5" id="Phil_t_5" class="pginternal">Of old Chalcodon</a> in Euboea.—From thence<br>
I have not far to Oeta, and the ridge<br>

So thou shalt bless my father with my sight.<br>
And yet long since I fear he may be gone.<br>
For oft I sent him suppliant prayers by men<br>
Who touched this isle, entreating him to fetch<br>
And bear me safely home with his own crew.<br>
But either he is dead, or else, methinks,<br>
It well may be, my messengers made light<br>

For like a merchantman, with no great sail,<br>
Making my course from Ilion to my home,<br>
Grape-clustered Peparethos, when I heard<br>
The mariners declare that one and all<br>
Were of thy crew, I would not launch again,<br>
Without a word, till we had told our news.—<br>

Whose wrath requites all wicked deeds of men?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
The act I deem the noblest for us both.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
Wilt thou speak so? Where is thy fear of Heaven?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Why should I fear, when I see certain gain?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
Gain for the sons of Atreus, or for me?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Methinks a friend should give thee friendly counsel.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
Friendly, to hand me over to my foes?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Ah, be not hardened in thy misery!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
I know thou wilt ruin me by what thou speakest.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Not I. The case is dark to thee, I see.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
I know the Atreidae cast me on this rock.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
But how, if they should save thee afterward?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
They ne’er shall make me see Troy with my will.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Hard is my fortune, then, if by no sleight<br>
Of reasoning I can draw thee to my mind.<br>
For me, ’twere easiest to end speech, that thou<br>
Might’st live on as thou livest in hopeless pain.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
Then leave me to my fate!—But thou hast touched<br>
My right hand with thine own, and given consent<br>
To bear me to my home. Do this, dear son!<br>
And do not linger to take thought of Troy.<br>
Enough that name hath echoed in my groans.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
If thou wilt, let us be going.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
<span class="in22">Nobly hast thou said the word.</span></p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="dpgn">[page 257]</span><span class="linenum">[1402-1436]</span>
<span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Lean thy steps on mine.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
<span class="in20">As firmly as my foot will strength afford.</span></p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Ah! but how shall I escape Achaean anger?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
<span class="in34">Do not care!</span></p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
Ah! but should they spoil my country!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
<span class="in30">I to shield thee will be there.</span></p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
How to shield me, how to aid me?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
<span class="in28">With the shafts of Heracles</span><br>
I will scare them.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
<span class="in6">Give thy blessing to this isle, and come in peace.</span></p>
<p class="sdn"><span class="cnm">HERACLES</span> appears from above.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HERACLES.</span>
First, son of Poeas, wait till thou hast heard<br>
The voice of Heracles, and weighed his word.<br>
Him thou beholdest from the Heavenly seat<br>
Come down, for thee leaving the blest retreat,<br>
To tell thee all high Zeus intends, and stay<br>
Thy purpose in the journey of to-day.<br>
<span class="in2">Then hear me, first how after my long toils</span><br>
By strange adventure I have found and won<br>
Immortal glory, which thine eyes perceive;<br>
And the like lot, I tell thee, shall be thine,<br>
After these pains to rise to glorious fame.<br>
Sailing with this thy comrade to Troy-town,<br>
First thou shalt heal thee from thy grievous sore,<br>
And then, being singled forth from all the host<br>
As noblest, thou shalt conquer with that bow<br>
Paris, prime author of these years of harm,<br>
And capture Troy, and bear back to thy hall<br>
The choicest guerdon, for thy valour’s meed,<br>
To Oeta’s vale and thine own father’s home.<br>
But every prize thou tak’st be sure thou bear<br>
Unto my pyre, in memory of my bow.<br>
<span class="in2">This word, Achilles’ offspring, is for thee</span><br>
No less. For, as thou could’st not without him,<br>
So, without thee, he cannot conquer Troy.<br>
Then, like twin lions hunting the same hill,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 258]</span><span class="linenum">[1437-1471]</span>
Guard thou him, and he thee! and I will send<br>
Asclepius Troyward to relieve thy pain.<br>
For Ilion now a second time must fall<br>
Before the Herculean bow. But, take good heed,<br>
Midst all your spoil to hold the gods in awe.<br>
For our great Father counteth piety<br>
Far above all. This follows men in death,<br>
And fails them not when they resign their breath.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
Thou whom I have longed to see,<br>
<span class="in4">Thy dear voice is law to me.</span></p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">NEO.</span>
I obey with gladdened heart.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">HER.</span>
Lose no time: at once depart!<br>
<span class="in4">Bright occasion and fair wind</span><br>
<span class="in4">Urge your vessel from behind.</span></p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PHI.</span>
Come, let me bless the region ere I go.<br>
<span class="in4">Poor house, sad comrade of my watch, farewell!</span><br>
<span class="in4">Ye nymphs of meadows where soft waters flow</span><br>
<span class="in4">Thou ocean headland, pealing thy deep knell,</span><br>
<span class="in4">Where oft within my cavern as I lay</span><br>
<span class="in4">My hair was moist with dashing south-wind’s spray,</span><br>
<span class="in4">And ofttimes came from Hermes’ foreland high</span><br>
<span class="in4">Sad replication of my storm-vext cry;</span><br>
<span class="in4">Ye fountains and thou Lycian water sweet,—</span><br>
<span class="in4">I never thought to leave you, yet my feet</span><br>
<span class="in4">Are turning from your paths,—we part for aye.</span><br>
<span class="in4">Farewell! and waft me kindly on my way,</span><br>
<span class="in4">O Lemnian earth enclosed by circling seas,</span><br>
<span class="in4">To sail, where mighty Fate my course decrees,</span><br>
<span class="in4">And friendly voices point me, and the will</span><br>
<span class="in4">Of that heroic power, who doth this act fulfil.</span></p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
Come now all in one strong band;<br>
<span class="in4">Then, ere loosing from the land,</span><br>
<span class="in4">Pray we to the nymphs of sea</span><br>
<span class="in4">Kind protectresses to be,</span><br>
<span class="in4">Till we touch the Trojan strand.</span></p>
