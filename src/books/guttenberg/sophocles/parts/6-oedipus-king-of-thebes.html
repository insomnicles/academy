<p class="lftbrk">SCENE. Before the Royal Palace in the Cadmean
citadel of Thebes.</p>
<p class="break"><span class="page2">[page 84]</span>
Laius, the descendant of Cadmus, and king of Thebes
(or Thebè), had been told by an oracle that if a son were
born to him by his wife Jocasta the boy would be his
father’s death.</p>
<p>Under such auspices, Oedipus was born, and to elude the
prophecy was exposed by his parents on Mount Cithaeron.
But he was saved by a compassionate shepherd, and became
the adopted son of Polybus, king of Corinth. When
he grew up he was troubled by a rumour that he was not
his father’s son. He went to consult the oracle of Apollo
at Delphi, and was told—not of his origin but of his destiny—that
he should be guilty of parricide and incest.</p>
<p>He was too horror-stricken to return to Corinth, and as
he travelled the other way, he met Laius going from Thebes
to Delphi. The travellers quarrelled and the son killed his
father, but knew not whom he had slain. He went onward
till he came near Thebes, where the Sphinx was
making havoc of the noblest citizens, devouring all who
failed to solve her riddle. But Oedipus succeeded and
overcame her, and, as Laius did not return, was rewarded
with the regal sceptre,—and with the hand of the queen.</p>
<p>He reigned nobly and prosperously, and lived happily
with Jocasta, by whom he had four children.</p>
<p>But after some years a plague descended on the people,
and Apollo, on being inquired of, answered that it was for
Laius’ death. The act of regicide must be avenged.
Oedipus undertakes the task of discovering the murderer,—and
in the same act discovers his own birth, and the fulfilment
of both the former prophecies.</p>
<p>Jocasta hangs herself, and Oedipus in his despair puts
out his eyes.</p>

<h3>KING OEDIPUS</h3>
<p class="sdn"><span class="cnm">OEDIPUS</span>—<span class="cnm">Priest of Zeus</span><br>
(with the <span class="cnm">Train of Suppliants</span> grouped before an altar).</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OEDIPUS.</span>
Nurslings of Cadmus, children of my care,<br>
Why press ye now to kneel before my gate<br>
With sacred branches in those suppliant hands,<br>
While o’er your city clouds of incense rise<br>
And sounds of praise, mingling with sounds of woe?<br>
<span class="in2">I would not learn of your estate, my sons,</span><br>
Through others, wherefore I myself am come,<br>
Your Oedipus,—a name well known to men.<br>
Speak, aged friend, whose look proclaims thee meet<br>
To be their spokesman—What desire, what fear<br>
Hath brought you? Doubt not of my earnest will<br>
To lend all succour. Hard would be the heart<br>
That looked unmoved on such a kneeling throng.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PRIEST.</span>
Great ruler of my country, thou beholdest<br>
The different ages of our flock who here<br>
Are gathered round thine altar,—some, whose wing<br>
Hath not yet ventured far from home, and some<br>
Burdened with many years, priests of the Gods,<br>
Myself the arch priest of Zeus, and these fresh youths,<br>
A chosen few. Others there are who crowd<br>
The holy agora and the temples twain<br>
Of Pallas, and Ismenus’ hallowed fires,<br>
A suppliant host. For, as thyself perceivest,<br>
Our city is tempest tost, and all too weak<br>
To lift above the waves her weary prow<br>
That plunges in a rude and ravenous sea.<br>
Earth’s buds are nipped, withering the germs within,<br>
Our cattle lose their increase, and our wives<br>
Have fruitless travail; and that scourge from Heaven,<br>
The fiery Pestilence abhorred of men,<br>
Descending on our people with dire stroke<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 86]</span><span class="linenum">[27-65]</span>
Lays waste the Home of Cadmus, while dark Death<br>
Wins ample tribute of laments and groans.<br>
<span class="in2">We kneel, then, at thy hearth; not likening thee</span><br>
Unto the gods, I nor these children here,<br>
But of men counting thee the first in might<br>
Whether to cope with earthly casualty<br>
Or visiting of more than earthly Power.<br>
Thou, in thy coming to this Theban land,<br>
Didst take away the hateful tax we paid<br>
To <a href="#King_n_1" id="King_t_1" class="pginternal">that stern songstress,</a>—aided not by us<br>
With hint nor counsel, but, as all believe,<br>
Gifted from heaven with life-restoring thought.<br>
Now too, great Oedipus of matchless fame,<br>
We all uplift our suppliant looks to thee,<br>
To find some help for us, whether from man,<br>
Or through the prompting of a voice Divine.<br>
Experienced counsel, we have seen and know,<br>
Hath ever prosperous issue. Thou, then, come,<br>
Noblest of mortals, give our city rest<br>
From sorrow! come, take heed! seeing this our land<br>
Now calls thee Saviour for thy former zeal;<br>
And ’twere not well to leave this memory<br>
Of thy great reign among Cadmean men,<br>
‘He raised us up, only again to fall.’<br>
Let the salvation thou hast wrought for us<br>
Be flawless and assured! As once erewhile<br>
Thy lucky star gave us prosperity,<br>
Be the same man to-day. Wouldst thou be king<br>
In power, as in command, ’tis greater far<br>
To rule a people than a wilderness.<br>
Since nought avails or city or buttressed wall<br>
Or gallant vessel, if unmanned and void.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OED.</span>
Ye touch me to the core. Full well I know<br>
Your trouble and your desire. Think not, my sons,<br>
I have no feeling of your misery!<br>
Yet none of you hath heaviness like mine.<br>
Your grief is held within the single breast<br>
Of each man severally. My burdened heart<br>
Mourns for myself, for Thebè, and for you.<br>
Your coming hath not roused me from repose:<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 87]</span><span class="linenum">[66-102]</span>
I have watched, and bitterly have wept; my mind<br>
Hath travelled many a labyrinth of thought.<br>
And now I have tried in act the only plan<br>
Long meditation showed me. I have sent<br>
The brother of my queen, Menoeceus’ son,<br>
Creon, to learn, in Phoebus’ Delphian Hall,<br>
What word or deed of mine may save this city.<br>
And when I count the time, I am full of pain<br>
To guess his speed; for he is absent long,<br>
Beyond the limit of expectancy.<br>
But when he shall appear, base then were I<br>
In aught to disobey the voice of Heaven.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">PR.</span>
Lo, in good time, crowning thy gracious word,<br>
’Tis told me by these youths, Creon draws near.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OED.</span>
Apollo! may his coming be as blest<br>
With saving fortune, as his looks are bright.</p>

Sure he brings joyful news; else had he ne’er<br>
Worn that full wreath of thickly-berried bay.</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">CREON</span>.</p>

Phoebus commands us now to punish home,<br>
Whoe’er they are, the authors of his death.</p>

But they, where are they? Where shall now be read<br>
The fading record of this ancient guilt?</p>

Is found, while things uncared for glide away.</p>

But where did Laius meet this violent end?<br>
At home, afield, or on some foreign soil?</p>

He had left us, as he said, to visit Delphi;<br>
But nevermore returned since he set forth.</p>

And was there none, no fellow traveller,<br>
To see, and tell the tale, and help our search?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CR.</span>
No, they were slain; save one, who, flying in fear,<br>
Had nought to tell us but one only thing.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OED.</span>
What was that thing? A little door of hope,<br>

A random troop of robbers, meeting him,<br>
Outnumbered and o’erpowered him. So ’twas told.</p>

What robber would have ventured such a deed,<br>
If unsolicited with bribes from hence?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CR.</span>
We thought of that. But Laius being dead,<br>
We found no helper in our miseries.</p>

When majesty was fallen, what misery<br>

A present trouble had engrossed our care.<br>
The riddling Sphinx compelled us to observe<br>
The moment’s grief, neglecting things unknown.</p>

But I will track this evil to the spring<br>
And clear it to the day. Most worthily<br>
Doth great Apollo, worthily dost thou<br>
Prompt this new care for the unthought of dead.<br>
And me too ye shall find a just ally,<br>
Succouring the cause of Phoebus and the land.<br>
Since, in dispelling this dark cloud, I serve<br>

No indirect or distant claim on me,<br>
But mine own life, for he that slew the king<br>
May one day turn his guilty hand ’gainst me<br>
With equal rage. In righting Laius, then,<br>
I forward mine own cause.—Now, children, rise<br>
From the altar-steps, and lift your suppliant boughs,<br>
And let some other summon to this place<br>
All Cadmus’ people, and assure them, I<br>
Will answer every need. This day shall see us<br>
Blest with glad fortune through God’s help, or fallen.</p>

Only may Phoebus, who hath sent this word,<br>

Your prayers are answered. Succour and relief<br>
Are yours, if ye will heed my voice and yield<br>
What help the plague requires. Hear it from me,<br>
Who am hitherto a stranger to the tale,<br>
As to the crime. Being nought concerned therewith,<br>

But now, as one adopted to your state,<br>
To all of you Cadmeans I speak this:<br>
Whoe’er among you knoweth the murderer<br>
Of Laius, son of royal Labdacus,<br>
Let him declare the deed in full to me.<br>
First, if the man himself be touched with fear,<br>
Let him depart, carrying the guilt away;<br>
No harm shall follow him:—he shall go free.<br>
Or if there be who knows another here,<br>
Come from some other country, to have wrought<br>
This murder, let him speak. Reward from me<br>
And store of kind remembrance shall be his.<br>
But if ye are silent, and one present here<br>
Who might have uttered this, shall hold his peace,<br>
As fearing for himself, or for his friend,<br>
What then shall be performed, hear me proclaim.<br>
I here prohibit all within this realm<br>
Whereof I wield the sceptre and sole sway,<br>
To admit the murderer, whosoe’er he be,<br>
Within their houses, or to speak with him,<br>
Or share with him in vow or sacrifice<br>

Who follows wholesome thoughts, to love the place<br>
Of domination rather than the power.<br>

How then can I desire to be a king,<br>
When masterdom is mine without annoy?<br>
Delusion hath not gone so far with me<br>
As to crave more than honour joined with gain.<br>
Now all men hail me happy, all embrace me;<br>
All who have need of thee, call in my aid;<br>
For thereupon their fortunes wholly turn.<br>
How should I leave this substance for that show?<br>
No man of sense can harbour thoughts of crime.<br>
Such vain ambition hath no charm for me,<br>
Nor could I bear to lend it countenance.<br>
If you would try me, go and ask again<br>
If I brought Phoebus’ answer truly back.<br>
Nay more, should I be found to have devised<br>
Aught in collusion with the seer, destroy me,<br>
Not by one vote, but two, mine own with thine.<br>
But do not on a dim suspicion blame me<br>
Of thy mere will. To darken a good name<br>
Without clear cause is heinous wickedness;<br>
And to cast off a worthy friend I call<br>
No less a folly than to fling away<br>
What most we love, the life within our breast.<br>
The certainty of this will come with time;<br>
For time alone can clear the righteous man.<br>

Word came to Laius once, I will not say<br>
From Phoebus’ self, but from his ministers,<br>
The King should be destroyed by his own son,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 105]</span><span class="linenum">[714-746]</span>
If son were born to him from me. What followed?<br>
Laius was slain, by robbers from abroad,<br>
Saith Rumour, in a cross-way! But the child<br>
Lived not three days, ere by my husband’s hand<br>
His feet were locked, and he was cast and left<br>
By messengers on the waste mountain wold.<br>
So Phoebus neither brought upon the boy<br>
His father’s murder, nor on Laius<br>
The thing he greatly feared, death by his son.<br>
Such issue came of prophesying words.<br>
Therefore regard them not. God can himself<br>
With ease bring forth what for his ends he needs.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OED.</span>
What strange emotions overcloud my soul,<br>

In shape and bearing much resembling thee.</p>

O heavy fate! How all unknowingly<br>
I laid that dreadful curse on my own head!</p>

And is he now at hand within the house?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">JO.</span>
No, truly. When he came from yonder scene<br>
And found thee king in room of Laius murdered,<br>
He touched my hand, and made his instant prayer<br>
That I would send him to o’erlook the flocks<br>
And rural pastures, so to live as far<br>
As might be from the very thought of Thebes.<br>
I granted his desire. No servant ever<br>
More richly merited such boon than he.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OED.</span>
Can he be brought again immediately?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">JO.</span>
Indeed he can. But why desire it so?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OED.</span>
Words have by me been uttered, O my queen,<br>
That give me too much cause to wish him here.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">JO.</span>
Then come he shall. But I may surely claim<br>
To hear what in thy state goes heavily.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OED.</span>
Thou shalt not lose thy rights in such an hour,<br>
When I am harrowed thus with doubt and fear.<br>
To whom more worthy should I tell my grief?<br>
—My father was Corinthian Polybus,<br>
My mother, Dorian Meropè.—I lived<br>
A prince among that people, till a chance<br>
Encountered me, worth wonder, but, though strange,<br>
Not worth the anxious thought it waked in me.<br>
For at a feasting once over the wine<br>
One deep in liquor called aloud to me,<br>
‘Hail, thou false foundling of a foster-sire!’<br>
That day with pain I held my passion down;<br>
But early on the morrow I came near<br>
And questioned both my parents, who were fierce<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 107]</span><span class="linenum">[784-820]</span>
In anger at the man who broached this word.<br>
For their part I was satisfied, but still<br>
It galled me, for the rumour would not die.<br>
<span class="in2">Eluding then my parents I made way</span><br>
To Delphi, where, as touching my desire,<br>
Phoebus denied me; but brake forth instead<br>
With other oracles of misery<br>
And horrible misfortune, how that I<br>
Must know my mother’s shame, and cause to appear<br>
A birth intolerable in human view,<br>
And do to death the author of my life.<br>
I fled forth at the word, conjecturing now<br>
Corinthia’s region by the stars of heaven,<br>
And wandered, where I never might behold<br>
Those dreadful prophecies fulfilled on me.<br>
So travelling on, I came even to the place<br>
Where, as thou tell’st, the King of Thebè fell.<br>
And, O my wife, I will hide nought from thee.<br>
When I drew near the cross-road of your tale,<br>
A herald, and a man upon a car,<br>
Like your description, there encountered me.<br>
And he who led the car, and he himself<br>
The greybeard, sought to thrust me from the path.<br>
Then in mine angry mood I sharply struck<br>
The driver-man who turned me from the way;<br>
Which when the elder saw, he watched for me<br>
As I passed by, and from the chariot-seat<br>
Smote full upon my head with the fork’d goad;<br>
But got more than he gave; for, by a blow<br>
From this right hand, smit with my staff, he fell<br>
Instantly rolled out of the car supine.<br>
I slew them every one. Now if that stranger<br>
Had aught in common with king Laius,<br>
What wretch on earth was e’er so lost as I?<br>
Whom have the Heavens so followed with their hate?<br>
No house of Theban or of foreigner<br>
Must any more receive me, none henceforth<br>
Must speak to me, but drive me from the door!<br>
I, I have laid this curse on mine own head!<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 108]</span><span class="linenum">[821-858]</span>
Yea, and this arm that slew him now enfolds<br>
His queen. O cruel stain! Am I not vile?<br>
Polluted utterly! Yes, I must flee,<br>
And, lost to Thebè, nevermore behold<br>
My home, nor tread my country, lest I meet<br>
In marriage mine own mother, and bring low<br>
His head that gave me life and reared my youth,<br>
My father, Polybus. Ah! right were he<br>
Who should declare some god of cruel mood<br>
Had sent this trouble upon my soul! Ye Powers,<br>
Worshipped in holiness, ne’er may I see<br>
That day, but perish from the sight of men,<br>
Ere sins like these be branded on my name!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CH.</span>
Thy fear is ours, O king: yet lose not hope,<br>
Till thou hast heard the witness of the deed.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OED.</span>
Ay, that is all I still have left of hope,<br>
To bide the coming of the shepherd man.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">JO.</span>
What eager thought attends his presence here?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OED.</span>
I’ll tell thee. Should his speech accord with thine,<br>
My life stands clear from this calamity.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">JO.</span>
What word of mine agreed not with the scene?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OED.</span>
You said he spake of robbers in a band<br>
As having slain him. Now if he shall still<br>
Persist in the same number, I am free.<br>
One man and many cannot be the same.<br>
But should he tell of one lone traveller,<br>
Then, unavoidably, this falls on me.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">JO.</span>
So ’twas given out by him, be sure of that.<br>
He cannot take it back. Not I alone<br>
But all the people heard him speak it so.<br>
And should he swerve in aught from his first tale,<br>
He ne’er can show the murder of the king<br>
Rightly accordant with the oracle.<br>
For Phoebus said expressly he should fall<br>
Through him whom I brought forth. But that poor babe<br>
Ne’er slew his sire, but perished long before.<br>
Wherefore henceforth I will pursue my way<br>
Regardless of all words of prophecy.</p>

Husband from husband, children from a child.<br>

Lay the ill-starred queen. Oh, then ’twas terrible<br>

Features far better not beheld, and fail<br>

Thus from two springs, from man and wife together,<br>
Rose the joint evil that is now o’erflowing.<br>

I have done deeds no death can e’er atone?<br>
Ah! but my children were a sight of joy,—<br>
Offspring of such a marriage! were they so?<br>
Never, to eyes of mine! nor town, nor tower,<br>
Nor holy shrines o’ the gods, which I myself,<br>
Dowered with the fairest life of Theban men,<br>
Have forfeited, alas, by mine own law,<br>
Declaring men should drive from every door<br>
One marked by Heaven as impious and impure,<br>
Nay worse, of Laius born! And was I then,<br>
By mine own edict branded thus, to look<br>
On Theban faces with unaltered eye?<br>
Nay verily, but had there been a way<br>
To stop the hearing fountain through the ear,<br>
I had not faltered, but had closed and barred<br>
Each gate of this poor body, deaf and blind!<br>
So thought might sweetly dwell at rest from ill<br>
Cithaeron! Why didst thou receive me? Why<br>
Not slay me then and there? So had I not<br>
Told to the world the horror of my birth.<br>
O foster home of Corinth and her king,<br>
How bright the life ye cherished, filming o’er<br>
What foulness far beneath! For I am vile,<br>
And vile were both my parents. So ’tis proved<br>
O cross road in the covert of the glen,<br>
O thicket in the gorge where three ways met,<br>
Bedewed by these my hands with mine own blood<br>
From whence I sprang—have ye forgotten me?<br>
Or doth some memory haunt you of the deeds<br>
I did before you, and went on to do<br>
Worse horrors here? O marriage twice accurst!<br>
That gave me being, and then again sent forth<br>
Fresh saplings springing from the selfsame seed,<br>
To amaze men’s eyes and minds with dire confusion<br>
Of father, brother, son, bride, mother, wife,<br>
Murder of parents, and all shames that are!<br>
Silence alone befits such deeds. Then, pray you,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 125]</span><span class="linenum">[1410-1445]</span>
Hide me immediately away from men!<br>
Kill me outright, or fling me far to sea,<br>
Where never ye may look upon me more.<br>
Come, lend your hand unto my misery!<br>
Comply, and fear not, for my load of woe<br>
Is incommunicable to all but me.</p>

With timely presence to fulfil thy need<br>

Be dead, let awe of the universal flame<br>
Of life’s great nourisher, our lord the Sun,<br>
Forbid your holding thus unveiled to view<br>
This huge abomination, which nor Earth<br>
Nor sacred Element, nor light of Heaven<br>
Can once endure. Convey him in with speed.<br>
Religion bids that kindred eyes and ears<br>
Alone should witness kindred crime and woe.</p>

So nobly meeting my unworthiness,<br>

The parricide, the unholy, should be slain.</p>

Not only so. But I will charge thee too,<br>
With urgent exhortation, to perform<br>
The funeral rite for her who lies within—<br>
She is thy kinswoman—howe’er thou wilt.<br>
But never let this city of my sires<br>
Claim me for living habitant! There, there<br>
Leave me to range the mountain, where my nurse,<br>
Cithaeron, echoeth with my name,—Cithaeron,<br>
Which both my parents destined for my tomb.<br>
So my true murderers will be my death.<br>
Yet one thing I can tell. Mine end will come<br>
Not by disease nor ordinary chance<br>
I had not lived when at the point to die,<br>
But for some terrible doom. Then let my fate<br>
Run out its full career. But for my children<br>
Thou, Creon, shalt provide. As for my sons,<br>
I pray thee burden not thyself with them.<br>
They ne’er will lack subsistence—they are men.<br>
But my poor maidens, hapless and forlorn,<br>
Who never had a meal apart from mine,<br>
But ever shared my table, yea, for them<br>
Take heedful care, and grant me, though but once.<br>
Yea, I beseech thee, with these hands to feel,<br>
Thou noble heart! the forms I love so well,<br>
And weep with them our common misery.<br>
Oh, if my arms were round them, I might seem<br>
To have them as of old when I could see—<br>
What! Am I fooled once more, or do I hear<br>
My dear ones weeping! And hath Creon sent,<br>
Pitying my sorrows, mine own children to me<br>
Whom most I love? Can this be truth I utter?</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CR.</span>
Yea, I have done it. For I knew the joy<br>
Thou ever hadst in this, thy comfort now.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OED.</span>
Fair be thy fortune, and, for this last deed,<br>
Heaven guide thee on a better course than mine.<br>
Where are ye, O my children? Come, draw near<br>
To these my hands of brother blood with you,<br>
Hands that have made so piteous to your sight<br>
The darkened gaze of his once brilliant eyes,<br>
Who all in blindness, with no thought of ill,<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 127]</span><span class="linenum">[1486-1517]</span>
Became your father at that fount of life,<br>
Where he himself took being! Oh! for you<br>
I weep, not seeing you, when I but think<br>
Of all the bitter passages of fate<br>
That must attend you amongst men. For where<br>
Can ye find fellowship, what civic throng<br>
Shall ye resort unto, what festival,<br>
From whence, instead of sight or sound enjoyed,<br>
Ye will not come in tears unto your home?<br>
And when ye reach the marriageable bloom,<br>
My daughters, who will be the man to cast<br>
His lot with yours, receiving for his own<br>
All those reproaches which have marred the name<br>
Of both my parents and your name no less?<br>
What evil is not here? Your father slew<br>
His father, and then eared the mother field<br>
Where he himself was sown, and got you from<br>
The source of his own birth. Such taunts will fly.<br>
And who will marry you? No man, my daughters;<br>
But ye must wither childless and unwed.<br>
Son of Menoeceus, who alone art left<br>
As father to these maidens, for the pair<br>
That gave them birth are utterly undone,<br>
Suffer them not, being your kinswomen,<br>
To wander desolate and poor, nor make<br>
Their lot perforce the counterpart of mine.<br>
But look on them with pity, left in youth<br>
Forlorn of all protection save from thee.<br>
Noble one, seal this promise with thy hand!<br>
—For you, my children, were ye of an age<br>
To ponder speech, I would have counselled you<br>
Full carefully. Now I would have you pray<br>
To dwell where ’tis convenient, that your life<br>
May find more blessing than your father knew.</p>
