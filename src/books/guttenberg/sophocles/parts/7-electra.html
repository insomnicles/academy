<p class="break"><span class="page2">[page 130]</span>
Agamemnon on his return from Troy, had been murdered
by his wife Clytemnestra and her paramour Aegisthus,
who had usurped the Mycenean throne. Orestes, then a
child, had been rescued by his sister Electra, and sent into
Phocis with the one servant who remained faithful to his
old master. The son of Agamemnon now returns, being of
a full age, accompanied by this same attendant and his
friend Pylades, with whom he has already concerted a plan
for taking vengeance on his father’s murderers, in obedience
to the command of Apollo.</p>
<p>Orestes had been received in Phocis by Strophius, his
father’s friend. Another Phocian prince, named Phanoteus,
was a friend of Aegisthus.</p>

Son of the king who led the Achaean host<br>
Erewhile beleaguering Troy, ’tis thine to day<br>
To see around thee what through many a year<br>
Thy forward spirit hath sighed for. Argolis<br>
Lies here before us, hallowed as the scene<br>
Of Io’s wildering pain: yonder, the mart<br>
Named from <a href="#Elec_n_1" id="Elec_t_1" class="pginternal">the wolf slaying God,</a> and there, to our left,<br>
Hera’s famed temple. For we reach the bourn<br>
Of far renowned Mycenae, rich in gold<br>
And Pelops’ fatal roofs before us rise,<br>
Haunted with many horrors, whence my hand,<br>
Thy murdered sire then lying in his gore,<br>
Received thee from thy sister, and removed<br>
Where I have kept thee safe and nourished thee<br>
To this bright manhood thou dost bear, to be<br>
The avenger of thy father’s bloody death.<br>
Wherefore, Orestes, and thou, Pylades,<br>
Dearest of friends, though from a foreign soil,<br>
Prepare your enterprise with speed. Dark night<br>
Is vanished with her stars, and day’s bright orb<br>
Hath waked the birds of morn into full song.<br>
Now, then, ere foot of man go forth, ye two<br>
Knit counsels. ’Tis no time for shy delay:<br>
The very moment for your act is come.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">OR.</span>
Kind faithful friend, how well thou mak’st appear<br>
Thy constancy in service to our house!<br>
As some good steed, aged, but nobly bred,<br>
Slacks not his spirit in the day of war,<br>
But points his ears to the fray, even so dost thou<br>
Press on and urge thy master in the van.<br>
Hear, then, our purpose, and if aught thy mind,<br>

In this I now set forth, admonish me.<br>
<span class="in2">I, when I visited the Pythian shrine</span><br>
Oracular, that I might learn whereby<br>
To punish home the murderers of my sire,<br>
Had word from Phoebus which you straight shall hear:<br>
‘No shielded host, but thine own craft, O King!<br>
The righteous death-blow to thine arm shall bring.’<br>
Then, since the will of Heaven is so revealed,<br>
Go thou within, when Opportunity<br>
Shall marshal thee the way, and gathering all<br>
Their business, bring us certain cognizance.<br>
Age and long absence are a safe disguise;<br>
They never will suspect thee who thou art.<br>
And let thy tale be that another land,<br>
Phocis, hath sent thee forth, and Phanoteus,<br>
Than whom they have no mightier help in war.<br>
Then, prefaced with an oath, declare thy news,<br>
Orestes’ death by dire mischance, down-rolled<br>
From wheel-borne chariot in the Pythian course.<br>
So let the fable be devised; while we,<br>
As Phoebus ordered, with luxuriant locks<br>
Shorn from our brows, and fair libations, crown<br>
My father’s sepulchre, and thence return<br>
Bearing aloft the shapely vase of bronze<br>
That’s hidden hard by in brushwood, as thou knowest,<br>
And bring them welcome tidings, that my form<br>
Is fallen ere now to ashes in the fire.<br>
How should this pain me, in pretence being dead,<br>
Really to save myself and win renown?<br>
No saying bodes men ill, that brings them gain.<br>
Oft have I known the wise, dying in word,<br>
Return with glorious salutation home.<br>
So lightened by this rumour shall mine eye<br>
Blaze yet like bale-star on mine enemies.<br>
O native earth! and Gods that hold the land,<br>
Accept me here, and prosper this my way!<br>
Thou, too, paternal hearth! To thee I come,<br>
Justly to cleanse thee by behest from heaven.<br>

My mother full of hate and hateful proved,<br>
Whilst I in my own home must dwell with these,<br>
My father’s murderers, and by them be ruled,<br>
Dependent on their bounty even for bread.<br>
And then what days suppose you I must pass,<br>
When I behold Aegisthus on the throne<br>
That was my father’s; when I see him wear<br>
Such robes, and pour libations by the hearth<br>
Where he destroyed him; lastly, when I see<br>
Their crowning insolence,—our regicide<br>
Laid in my father’s chamber beside her,<br>
My mother—if she still must bear the name<br>
When resting in those arms? Her shame is dead.<br>
She harbours with blood-guiltiness, and fears<br>
No vengeance, but, as laughing at the wrong,<br>
She watches for the hour wherein with guile<br>
She killed our sire, and orders dance and mirth<br>
That day o’ the month, and joyful sacrifice<br>
Of thanksgiving. But I within the house<br>
Beholding, weep and pine, and mourn that feast<br>
Of infamy, called by my father’s name,<br>
All to myself; for not even grief may flow<br>

O’ercrows my wailing with loud obloquy:<br>
‘Hilding! are you alone in grief? Are none<br>
Mourning for loss of fathers but yourself?<br>
‘Fore the blest Gods! ill may you thrive, and ne’er<br>
Find cure of sorrow from the powers below!’<br>
So she insults: unless she hear one say<br>
‘Orestes will arrive’: then standing close,<br>
She shouts like one possessed into mine ear,<br>
‘These are your doings, this your work, I trow.<br>
You stole Orestes from my gripe, and placed<br>
His life with fosterers; but you shall pay<br>
Full penalty.’ So harsh is her exclaim.<br>
And he at hand, the husband she extols,<br>
Hounds on the cry, that prince of cowardice,<br>
From head to foot one mass of pestilent harm.<br>
Tongue-doughty champion of this women’s-war.<br>
I, for Orestes ever languishing<br>
To end this, am undone. For evermore<br>
Intending, still delaying, he wears out<br>
All hope, both here and yonder. How, then, friends,<br>
Can I be moderate, or feel the touch<br>
Of holy resignation? Evil fruit<br>
Cannot but follow on a life of ill.</p>

The sceptre which he bore of old, and now<br>
Aegisthus bears: and out of this upsprang<br>
A burgeoned shoot, that shadowed all the ground<br>

Told by a maid who listened when the Queen<br>
Made known her vision to the God of Day.<br>

And criminal to offer to thy sire<br>
Rites and libations from a hateful wife.<br>
Then cast them to the winds, or deep in dust<br>
Conceal them, where no particle may reach<br>
His resting-place: but lie in store for her<br>
When she goes underground. Sure, were she not<br>
Most hardened of all women that have been,<br>
She ne’er had sent those loveless offerings<br>
To grace the sepulchre of him she slew.<br>
For think how likely is the buried king<br>
To take such present kindly from her hand,<br>
Who slew him like an alien enemy,<br>
Dishonoured even in death, and mangled him,<br>
And wiped the death-stain with his flowing locks—<br>
Sinful purgation! Think you that you bear<br>
In those cold gifts atonement for her guilt?<br>
It is not possible. Wherefore let be.<br>
But take a ringlet from thy comely head,<br>

He would arise to help us ’gainst his foes,<br>
And grant his son Orestes with high hand<br>
Strongly to trample on his enemies;<br>
That in our time to come from ampler stores<br>
We may endow him, than are ours to-day.<br>
I cannot but imagine that his will<br>

But howsoe’er, I pray thee, sister mine,<br>

Again you are let loose and range at will.<br>
Ay, for Aegisthus is not here, who barred<br>
Your rashness from defaming your own kin<br>
Beyond the gates. But now he’s gone from home,<br>
You heed not me: though you have noised abroad<br>
That I am bold in crime, and domineer<br>
Outrageously, oppressing thee and thine.<br>
I am no oppressor, but I speak thee ill,<br>
For thou art ever speaking ill of me—<br>
Still holding forth thy father’s death, that I<br>
Have done it. So I did: I know it well:<br>
That I deny not; for not I alone<br>
But Justice slew him; and if you had sense,<br>
To side with Justice ought to be your part.<br>
For who but he of all the Greeks, your sire,<br>
For whom you whine and cry, who else but he<br>
Took heart to sacrifice unto the Gods<br>
Thy sister?—having less of pain, I trow,<br>
In getting her, than I, that bore her, knew!<br>
Come, let me question thee! On whose behalf<br>
Slew he my child? Was ’t for the Argive host?<br>
What right had they to traffic in my flesh?—<br>
Menelaüs was his brother. Wilt thou say<br>
He slew my daughter for his brother’s sake?<br>
How then should he escape me? Had not he,<br>
Menelaüs, children twain, begotten of her<br>
Whom to reclaim that army sailed to Troy?<br>
Was Death then so enamoured of my seed,<br>
That he must feast thereon and let theirs live?<br>
Or was the God-abandoned father’s heart<br>
Tender toward them and cruel to my child?<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 146]</span><span class="linenum">[546-581]</span>
Doth this not argue an insensate sire?<br>
I think so, though your wisdom may demur.<br>
And could my lost one speak, she would confirm it.<br>
For my part, I can dwell on what I have done<br>
Without regret. You, if you think me wrong,<br>
Bring reasons forth and blame me to my face!</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">EL.</span>
Thou canst not say this time that I began<br>
And brought this on me by some taunting word.<br>
But, so you’d suffer me, I would declare<br>
The right both for my sister and my sire.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">CLY.</span>
Thou hast my sufferance. Nor would hearing vex,<br>
If ever thus you tuned your speech to me.</p>
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">EL.</span>
Then I will speak. You say you slew him. Where<br>
Could there be found confession more depraved,<br>
Even though the cause were righteous? But I’ll prove<br>
No rightful vengeance drew thee to the deed,<br>
But the vile bands of him you dwell with now.<br>
Or ask the huntress Artemis, what sin<br>
She punished, when she tied up all the winds<br>
Round Aulis.—I will tell thee, for her voice<br>
Thou ne’er may’st hear! ’Tis rumoured that my sire,<br>
Sporting within the goddess’ holy ground,<br>
His foot disturbed a dappled hart, whose death<br>
Drew from his lips some rash and boastful word.<br>
Wherefore Latona’s daughter in fell wrath<br>
Stayed the army, that in quittance for the deer<br>
My sire should slay at the altar his own child.<br>
So came her sacrifice. The Achaean fleet<br>
Had else no hope of being launched to Troy<br>
Nor to their homes. Wherefore, with much constraint<br>
And painful urging of his backward will,<br>
Hardly he yielded;—not for his brother’s sake.<br>
But grant thy speech were sooth, and all were done<br>
In aid of Menelaüs; for this cause<br>
Hadst thou the right to slay him? What high law<br>
Ordaining? Look to it, in establishing<br>
Such precedent thou dost not lay in store<br>
Repentance for thyself. For if by right<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 147]</span><span class="linenum">[581-620]</span>
One die for one, thou first wilt be destroyed<br>
If Justice find thee.—But again observe<br>
The hollowness of thy pretended plea.<br>
Tell me, I pray, what cause thou dost uphold<br>
In doing now the basest deed of all,<br>
Chambered with the blood-guilty, with whose aid<br>
Thou slewest our father in that day. For him<br>
You now bear children—ousting from their right<br>
The stainless offspring of a holy sire.<br>
How should this plead for pardon? Wilt thou say<br>
Thus thou dost ’venge thy daughter’s injury?<br>
O shameful plea? Where is the thought of honour,<br>
If foes are married for a daughter’s sake?—<br>
Enough. No words can move thee. Thy rash tongue<br>
With checkless clamour cries that we revile<br>
Our mother. Nay, no mother, but the chief<br>
Of tyrants to us! For my life is full<br>
Of weariness and misery from thee<br>
And from thy paramour. While he abroad,<br>
Orestes, our one brother, who escaped<br>
Hardly from thy attempt, unhappy boy!<br>
Wears out his life, victim of cross mischance.<br>
Oft hast thou taunted me with fostering him<br>
To be thy punisher. And this, be sure,<br>
Had I but strength, I had done. Now for this word,<br>
Proclaim me what thou wilt,—evil in soul,<br>
Or loud in cursing, or devoid of shame:<br>
For if I am infected with such guilt,<br>
Methinks my nature is not fallen from thine.</p>

List, then, as I shall speak: and grant the dreams<br>
Whose two-fold apparition I to-night<br>
Have seen, if good their bodement, be fulfilled:<br>
If hostile, turn their influence on my foes.<br>

Thrust me from this high fortune, but vouchsafe<br>

He, entering on the great arena famed<br>
As Hellas’ pride, to win a Delphian prize,<br>
On hearing the loud summons of the man<br>
Calling the foot-race, which hath trial first,<br>
Came forward, a bright form, admired by all.<br>
And when his prowess in the course fulfilled<br>
The promise of his form, he issued forth<br>
Dowered with the splendid meed of victory.—<br>
To tell a few out of the many feats<br>
Of such a hero were beyond my power.<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 150]</span><span class="linenum">[690-727]</span>
Know then, in brief, that of the prizes set<br>
For every customary course proclaimed<br>
By order of the judges, the whole sum<br>
Victoriously he gathered, happy deemed<br>
By all; declared an Argive, and his name<br>
Orestes, son of him who levied once<br>
The mighty armament of Greeks for Troy.<br>
So fared he then: but when a God inclines<br>
To hinder happiness, not even the strong<br>
Are scatheless. So, another day, when came<br>
At sunrise the swift race of charioteers,<br>
He entered there with many a rival car:—<br>
One from Achaia, one from Sparta, two<br>
Libyan commanders of the chariot-yoke;<br>
And he among them fifth, with steeds of price<br>
From Thessaly;—the sixth Aetolia sent<br>
With chestnut mares; the seventh a Magnete man;<br>
The eighth with milk-white colts from Oeta’s vale;<br>
The ninth from god-built Athens; and the tenth<br>
Boeotia gave to make the number full.<br>
Then stood they where the judges of the course<br>
Had posted them by lot, each with his team;<br>
And sprang forth at the brazen trumpet’s blare.<br>
Shouting together to their steeds, they shook<br>
The reins, and all the course was filled with noise<br>
Of rattling chariots, and the dust arose<br>
To heaven. Now all in a confusèd throng<br>
Spared not the goad, each eager to outgo<br>
The crowded axles and the snorting steeds;<br>
For close about his nimbly circling wheels<br>
And stooping sides fell flakes of panted foam.<br>
Orestes, ever nearest at the turn,<br>
With whirling axle seemed to graze the stone,<br>
And loosing with free rein the right-hand steed<br>
<a href="#Elec_n_5" id="Elec_t_5" class="pginternal">That pulled the side-rope,</a> held the near one in.<br>
<span class="in2">So for a time all chariots upright moved,</span><br>
But soon the Oetaean’s hard-mouthed horses broke<br>
From all control, and wheeling as they passed<br>
From the sixth circuit to begin the seventh,<br>
Smote front to front against the Barcan car.<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 151]</span><span class="linenum">[728-766]</span>
And when that one disaster had befallen,<br>
Each dashed against his neighbour and was thrown,<br>
Till the whole plain was strewn with chariot-wreck.<br>
Then the Athenian, skilled to ply the rein,<br>
Drew on one side, and heaving to, let pass<br>
The rider-crested surge that rolled i’ the midst.<br>
Meanwhile Orestes, trusting to the end,<br>
Was driving hindmost with tight rein; but now,<br>
Seeing him left the sole competitor,<br>
Hurling fierce clamour through his steeds, pursued:<br>
So drave they yoke by yoke—now this, now that<br>
Pulling ahead with car and team. Orestes,<br>
Ill-fated one, each previous course had driven<br>
Safely without a check, but after this,<br>
<a href="#Elec_n_6" id="Elec_t_6" class="pginternal">In letting loose again the left-hand rein,</a><br>
He struck the edge of the stone before he knew,<br>
Shattering the axle’s end, and tumbled prone,<br>
<a href="#Elec_n_7" id="Elec_t_7" class="pginternal">Caught in the reins,</a> that dragged him with sharp thongs.<br>
Then as he fell to the earth the horses swerved,<br>
And roamed the field. The people when they saw<br>
Him fallen from out the car, lamented loud<br>
For the fair youth, who had achieved before them<br>
Such glorious feats, and now had found such woe,—<br>
Dashed on the ground, then tossed with legs aloft<br>
Against the sky,—until the charioteers,<br>
Hardly restraining the impetuous team,<br>
Released him, covered so with blood that none,—<br>
No friend who saw—had known his hapless form.<br>
Which then we duly burned upon the pyre.<br>
And straightway men appointed to the task<br>
From all the Phocians bear his mighty frame—<br>
Poor ashes! narrowed in a brazen urn,—<br>
That he may find in his own fatherland<br>
His share of sepulture.—Such our report,<br>
Painful to hear, but unto us, who saw,<br>

Well, I will tell thee all I saw:—I came<br>
Unto the ancient tomb that holds our sire;<br>
And from the topmost mound I marked a stream<br>
Of milk fresh-flowing, and his resting place<br>
Ringed round with garlands of all flowers that blow.<br>
I marvelled at the sight, and peered about,<br>
Lest some one might be nearer than we knew.<br>
But finding all was quiet in the spot,<br>
I ventured closer to the tomb, and there,<br>
Hard by the limit, I beheld a curl<br>
Of hair new shorn, with all the gloss of youth<br>
And straight it struck my heart, as with a sense<br>
Of something seen, ah me! long, long ago,<br>
And told me that my sight encountered here<br>
The token of Orestes, dearest soul<br>
Then, clasping it, I did not cry aloud,<br>
But straight mine eyes were filled with tears of joy.<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 156]</span><span class="linenum">[907-943]</span>
And now as much as then I feel assured<br>
He and none else bestowed this ornament.<br>
To whom beyond thyself and me belongs<br>
Such consecration? And I know this well,<br>
I did it not,—nor thou. Impossible!<br>
Thou canst not worship even the blessèd Gods<br>
Forth of this roof, unpunished. And, most sure,<br>
Our mother is not minded so to act,<br>
Nor, had she done it, could we fail to know.<br>
This offering comes then of Orestes’ hand.<br>
Take courage, dear one. Not one fate pursues<br>
One house perpetually, but changeth still.<br>
Ours was a sullen Genius, but perchance<br>
This day begins the assurance of much good.</p>

Then hearken my resolve. Thou seëst now,<br>
We have no friendly succour in the world;<br>
But death has taken all, and we are left<br>
Two only. I, so long as I could hear<br>
My brother lived and flourished, still had hope<br>
He would arise to wreak his father’s blood.<br>
But now that he is gone, to thee I turn,<br>
To help thy sister boldly to destroy<br>
The guilty author of our father’s death,<br>
Aegisthus.—Wherefore hide it from thee now?<br>
—Yea, sister! Till what term wilt thou remain<br>
Inactive? To what end? What hope is yet<br>
Left standing? Surely thou hast cause to grieve,<br>
Bobbed of thy father’s opulent heritage,<br>
And feeling bitterly the creeping years<br>
That find thee still a virgin and unwed.<br>
Nay, nor imagine thou shalt ever know<br>
That blessing. Not so careless of his life<br>
Is King Aegisthus, as to risk the birth<br>
Of sons from us, to his most certain fall.<br>
But if thou wilt but follow my resolve,<br>
First thou shalt win renown of piety<br>
From our dead father, and our brother too,<br>
Who rest beneath the ground, and shalt be free<br>
For evermore in station as in birth,<br>
And nobly matched in marriage, for the good<br>
Draw gazers to them still. Then seest thou not<br>
What meed of honour, if thou dost my will,<br>
Thou shalt apportion to thyself and me?<br>
For who, beholding us, what citizen,<br>
What foreigner, will not extend the hand<br>
Of admiration, and exclaim, ‘See, friends,<br>
These scions of one stock, these noble twain,<br>
These that have saved their father’s house from woe,<br>
Who once when foes were mighty, set their life<br>
Upon a cast, and stood forth to avenge<br>
The stain of blood! Who will not love the pair<br>
<span class="dpgn">[page 158]</span><span class="linenum">[981-1018]</span>
And do them reverence? Who will not give<br>
Honour at festivals, and in the throng<br>
Of popular resort, to these in chief,<br>
For their high courage and their bold emprise?’<br>
Such fame will follow us in all the world.<br>
Living or dying, still to be renowned.<br>
Ah, then, comply, dear sister; give thy sire<br>
This toil—this labour to thy brother give;<br>

Wherein I decked thee as I sent thee forth!<br>
Then bright was thy departure, whom I now<br>
Bear lightly, a mere nothing, in my hands.<br>
Would I had gone from life, ere I dispatched<br>
Thee from my arms that saved thee to a land<br>
Of strangers, stealing thee from death! For then<br>
Thou hadst been quiet on that far off day,<br>
And had thy portion in our father’s tomb<br>
Now thou hast perished in the stranger land<br>
Far from thy sister, lorn and comfortless<br>
And I, O wretchedness! neither have bathed<br>
And laid thee forth, nor from the blazing fire<br>
Collected the sad burden, as was meet<br>
But thou, when foreign hands have tended thee<br>
Com’st a small handful in a narrow shell<br>
Woe for the constant care I spent on thee<br>
Of old all vainly, with sweet toil! For never<br>
Wast thou thy mother’s darling, nay, but mine,<br>
And I of all the household most thy nurse,<br>
While ‘sister, sister,’ was thy voice to me<br>
But now all this is vanished in one day,<br>
Dying in thy death. Thou hast carried all away<br>
As with a whirlwind, and art gone. No more<br>
My father lives, thyself art lost in death,<br>
I am dead, who lived in thee. Our enemies<br>
Laugh loudly, and she maddens in her joy,<br>
Our mother most unmotherly, of whom<br>
Thy secret missives ofttimes told me, thou<br>
Wouldst be the punisher. But that fair hope<br>
The hapless Genius of thy lot and mine<br>
Hath reft away, and gives thee thus to me,—<br>
For thy loved form thy dust and fruitless shade<br>
O bitterness! O piteous sight! Woe! woe!<br>
Oh! sent on thy dire journey, dearest one,<br>

Dear brother! Then receive me to thyself,<br>
Hide me in this thy covering, there to dwell,<br>
Me who am nothing, with thy nothingness,<br>
For ever! Yea, when thou wert here above,<br>
I ever shared with thee in all, and now<br>
I would not have thee shut me from thy tomb.<br>
Oh! let me die and follow thee! the dead,<br>
My mind assures me now, have no more pain.</p>

Which of you know where are the Phocian men<br>
Who brought the news I hear, Orestes’ life<br>
Hath suffered shipwreck in a chariot-race?<br>
You, you I question, you in former time<br>
So fearless! You methinks most feelingly<br>
Can tell us, for it touches you most near.</p>

I know: assure thee. Else had I not heard<br>
The dearest of all fortunes to my heart.</p>

Not only so. They showed him to our sight.</p>

Silence, I say! Wide let the gates be flung!<br>
For all the Myceneans to behold<br>
And all in Argolis, that if but one<br>

Fixed in Orestes, seeing him now dead,<br>
