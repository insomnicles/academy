<h2>
      APPENDIX I.
    </h2>
<p>
      It seems impossible to separate by any exact line the genuine writings of
      Plato from the spurious. The only external evidence to them which is of
      much value is that of Aristotle; for the Alexandrian catalogues of a
      century later include manifest forgeries. Even the value of the
      Aristotelian authority is a good deal impaired by the uncertainty
      concerning the date and authorship of the writings which are ascribed to
      him. And several of the citations of Aristotle omit the name of Plato, and
      some of them omit the name of the dialogue from which they are taken.
      Prior, however, to the enquiry about the writings of a particular author,
      general considerations which equally affect all evidence to the
      genuineness of ancient writings are the following: Shorter works are more
      likely to have been forged, or to have received an erroneous designation,
      than longer ones; and some kinds of composition, such as epistles or
      panegyrical orations, are more liable to suspicion than others; those,
      again, which have a taste of sophistry in them, or the ring of a later
      age, or the slighter character of a rhetorical exercise, or in which a
      motive or some affinity to spurious writings can be detected, or which
      seem to have originated in a name or statement really occurring in some
      classical author, are also of doubtful credit; while there is no instance
      of any ancient writing proved to be a forgery, which combines excellence
      with length. A really great and original writer would have no object in
      fathering his works on Plato; and to the forger or imitator, the 'literary
      hack' of Alexandria and Athens, the Gods did not grant originality or
      genius. Further, in attempting to balance the evidence for and against a
      Platonic dialogue, we must not forget that the form of the Platonic
      writing was common to several of his contemporaries. Aeschines, Euclid,
      Phaedo, Antisthenes, and in the next generation Aristotle, are all said to
      have composed dialogues; and mistakes of names are very likely to have
      occurred. Greek literature in the third century before Christ was almost
      as voluminous as our own, and without the safeguards of regular
      publication, or printing, or binding, or even of distinct titles. An
      unknown writing was naturally attributed to a known writer whose works
      bore the same character; and the name once appended easily obtained
      authority. A tendency may also be observed to blend the works and opinions
      of the master with those of his scholars. To a later Platonist, the
      difference between Plato and his imitators was not so perceptible as to
      ourselves. The Memorabilia of Xenophon and the Dialogues of Plato are but
      a part of a considerable Socratic literature which has passed away. And we
      must consider how we should regard the question of the genuineness of a
      particular writing, if this lost literature had been preserved to us.
    </p>
<p>
      These considerations lead us to adopt the following criteria of
      genuineness: (1) That is most certainly Plato's which Aristotle attributes
      to him by name, which (2) is of considerable length, of (3) great
      excellence, and also (4) in harmony with the general spirit of the
      Platonic writings. But the testimony of Aristotle cannot always be
      distinguished from that of a later age (see above); and has various
      degrees of importance. Those writings which he cites without mentioning
      Plato, under their own names, e.g. the Hippias, the Funeral Oration, the
      Phaedo, etc., have an inferior degree of evidence in their favour. They
      may have been supposed by him to be the writings of another, although in
      the case of really great works, e.g. the Phaedo, this is not credible;
      those again which are quoted but not named, are still more defective in
      their external credentials. There may be also a possibility that Aristotle
      was mistaken, or may have confused the master and his scholars in the case
      of a short writing; but this is inconceivable about a more important work,
      e.g. the Laws, especially when we remember that he was living at Athens,
      and a frequenter of the groves of the Academy, during the last twenty
      years of Plato's life. Nor must we forget that in all his numerous
      citations from the Platonic writings he never attributes any passage found
      in the extant dialogues to any one but Plato. And lastly, we may remark
      that one or two great writings, such as the Parmenides and the Politicus,
      which are wholly devoid of Aristotelian (1) credentials may be fairly
      attributed to Plato, on the ground of (2) length, (3) excellence, and (4)
      accordance with the general spirit of his writings. Indeed the greater
      part of the evidence for the genuineness of ancient Greek authors may be
      summed up under two heads only: (1) excellence; and (2) uniformity of
      tradition—a kind of evidence, which though in many cases sufficient,
      is of inferior value.
    </p>
<p>
      Proceeding upon these principles we appear to arrive at the conclusion
      that nineteen-twentieths of all the writings which have ever been ascribed
      to Plato, are undoubtedly genuine. There is another portion of them,
      including the Epistles, the Epinomis, the dialogues rejected by the
      ancients themselves, namely, the Axiochus, De justo, De virtute,
      Demodocus, Sisyphus, Eryxias, which on grounds, both of internal and
      external evidence, we are able with equal certainty to reject. But there
      still remains a small portion of which we are unable to affirm either that
      they are genuine or spurious. They may have been written in youth, or
      possibly like the works of some painters, may be partly or wholly the
      compositions of pupils; or they may have been the writings of some
      contemporary transferred by accident to the more celebrated name of Plato,
      or of some Platonist in the next generation who aspired to imitate his
      master. Not that on grounds either of language or philosophy we should
      lightly reject them. Some difference of style, or inferiority of
      execution, or inconsistency of thought, can hardly be considered decisive
      of their spurious character. For who always does justice to himself, or
      who writes with equal care at all times? Certainly not Plato, who exhibits
      the greatest differences in dramatic power, in the formation of sentences,
      and in the use of words, if his earlier writings are compared with his
      later ones, say the Protagoras or Phaedrus with the Laws. Or who can be
      expected to think in the same manner during a period of authorship
      extending over above fifty years, in an age of great intellectual
      activity, as well as of political and literary transition? Certainly not
      Plato, whose earlier writings are separated from his later ones by as wide
      an interval of philosophical speculation as that which separates his later
      writings from Aristotle.
    </p>
<p>
      The dialogues which have been translated in the first Appendix, and which
      appear to have the next claim to genuineness among the Platonic writings,
      are the Lesser Hippias, the Menexenus or Funeral Oration, the First
      Alcibiades. Of these, the Lesser Hippias and the Funeral Oration are cited
      by Aristotle; the first in the Metaphysics, the latter in the Rhetoric.
      Neither of them are expressly attributed to Plato, but in his citation of
      both of them he seems to be referring to passages in the extant dialogues.
      From the mention of 'Hippias' in the singular by Aristotle, we may perhaps
      infer that he was unacquainted with a second dialogue bearing the same
      name. Moreover, the mere existence of a Greater and Lesser Hippias, and of
      a First and Second Alcibiades, does to a certain extent throw a doubt upon
      both of them. Though a very clever and ingenious work, the Lesser Hippias
      does not appear to contain anything beyond the power of an imitator, who
      was also a careful student of the earlier Platonic writings, to invent.
      The motive or leading thought of the dialogue may be detected in Xen.
      Mem., and there is no similar instance of a 'motive' which is taken from
      Xenophon in an undoubted dialogue of Plato. On the other hand, the
      upholders of the genuineness of the dialogue will find in the Hippias a
      true Socratic spirit; they will compare the Ion as being akin both in
      subject and treatment; they will urge the authority of Aristotle; and they
      will detect in the treatment of the Sophist, in the satirical reasoning
      upon Homer, in the reductio ad absurdum of the doctrine that vice is
      ignorance, traces of a Platonic authorship. In reference to the last point
      we are doubtful, as in some of the other dialogues, whether the author is
      asserting or overthrowing the paradox of Socrates, or merely following the
      argument 'whither the wind blows.' That no conclusion is arrived at is
      also in accordance with the character of the earlier dialogues. The
      resemblances or imitations of the Gorgias, Protagoras, and Euthydemus,
      which have been observed in the Hippias, cannot with certainty be adduced
      on either side of the argument. On the whole, more may be said in favour
      of the genuineness of the Hippias than against it.
    </p>
<p>
      The Menexenus or Funeral Oration is cited by Aristotle, and is interesting
      as supplying an example of the manner in which the orators praised 'the
      Athenians among the Athenians,' falsifying persons and dates, and casting
      a veil over the gloomier events of Athenian history. It exhibits an
      acquaintance with the funeral oration of Thucydides, and was, perhaps,
      intended to rival that great work. If genuine, the proper place of the
      Menexenus would be at the end of the Phaedrus. The satirical opening and
      the concluding words bear a great resemblance to the earlier dialogues;
      the oration itself is professedly a mimetic work, like the speeches in the
      Phaedrus, and cannot therefore be tested by a comparison of the other
      writings of Plato. The funeral oration of Pericles is expressly mentioned
      in the Phaedrus, and this may have suggested the subject, in the same
      manner that the Cleitophon appears to be suggested by the slight mention
      of Cleitophon and his attachment to Thrasymachus in the Republic; and the
      Theages by the mention of Theages in the Apology and Republic; or as the
      Second Alcibiades seems to be founded upon the text of Xenophon, Mem. A
      similar taste for parody appears not only in the Phaedrus, but in the
      Protagoras, in the Symposium, and to a certain extent in the Parmenides.
    </p>
<p>
      To these two doubtful writings of Plato I have added the First Alcibiades,
      which, of all the disputed dialogues of Plato, has the greatest merit, and
      is somewhat longer than any of them, though not verified by the testimony
      of Aristotle, and in many respects at variance with the Symposium in the
      description of the relations of Socrates and Alcibiades. Like the Lesser
      Hippias and the Menexenus, it is to be compared to the earlier writings of
      Plato. The motive of the piece may, perhaps, be found in that passage of
      the Symposium in which Alcibiades describes himself as self-convicted by
      the words of Socrates. For the disparaging manner in which Schleiermacher
      has spoken of this dialogue there seems to be no sufficient foundation. At
      the same time, the lesson imparted is simple, and the irony more
      transparent than in the undoubted dialogues of Plato. We know, too, that
      Alcibiades was a favourite thesis, and that at least five or six dialogues
      bearing this name passed current in antiquity, and are attributed to
      contemporaries of Socrates and Plato. (1) In the entire absence of real
      external evidence (for the catalogues of the Alexandrian librarians cannot
      be regarded as trustworthy); and (2) in the absence of the highest marks
      either of poetical or philosophical excellence; and (3) considering that
      we have express testimony to the existence of contemporary writings
      bearing the name of Alcibiades, we are compelled to suspend our judgment
      on the genuineness of the extant dialogue.
    </p>
<p>
      Neither at this point, nor at any other, do we propose to draw an absolute
      line of demarcation between genuine and spurious writings of Plato. They
      fade off imperceptibly from one class to another. There may have been
      degrees of genuineness in the dialogues themselves, as there are certainly
      degrees of evidence by which they are supported. The traditions of the
      oral discourses both of Socrates and Plato may have formed the basis of
      semi-Platonic writings; some of them may be of the same mixed character
      which is apparent in Aristotle and Hippocrates, although the form of them
      is different. But the writings of Plato, unlike the writings of Aristotle,
      seem never to have been confused with the writings of his disciples: this
      was probably due to their definite form, and to their inimitable
      excellence. The three dialogues which we have offered in the Appendix to
      the criticism of the reader may be partly spurious and partly genuine;
      they may be altogether spurious;—that is an alternative which must
      be frankly admitted. Nor can we maintain of some other dialogues, such as
      the Parmenides, and the Sophist, and Politicus, that no considerable
      objection can be urged against them, though greatly overbalanced by the
      weight (chiefly) of internal evidence in their favour. Nor, on the other
      hand, can we exclude a bare possibility that some dialogues which are
      usually rejected, such as the Greater Hippias and the Cleitophon, may be
      genuine. The nature and object of these semi-Platonic writings require
      more careful study and more comparison of them with one another, and with
      forged writings in general, than they have yet received, before we can
      finally decide on their character. We do not consider them all as genuine
      until they can be proved to be spurious, as is often maintained and still
      more often implied in this and similar discussions; but should say of some
      of them, that their genuineness is neither proven nor disproven until
      further evidence about them can be adduced. And we are as confident that
      the Epistles are spurious, as that the Republic, the Timaeus, and the Laws
      are genuine.
    </p>
<p>
      On the whole, not a twentieth part of the writings which pass under the
      name of Plato, if we exclude the works rejected by the ancients themselves
      and two or three other plausible inventions, can be fairly doubted by
      those who are willing to allow that a considerable change and growth may
      have taken place in his philosophy (see above). That twentieth debatable
      portion scarcely in any degree affects our judgment of Plato, either as a
      thinker or a writer, and though suggesting some interesting questions to
      the scholar and critic, is of little importance to the general reader.

<h2>
      INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
<p>
      The First Alcibiades is a conversation between Socrates and Alcibiades.
      Socrates is represented in the character which he attributes to himself in
      the Apology of a know-nothing who detects the conceit of knowledge in
      others. The two have met already in the Protagoras and in the Symposium;
      in the latter dialogue, as in this, the relation between them is that of a
      lover and his beloved. But the narrative of their loves is told
      differently in different places; for in the Symposium Alcibiades is
      depicted as the impassioned but rejected lover; here, as coldly receiving
      the advances of Socrates, who, for the best of purposes, lies in wait for
      the aspiring and ambitious youth.
    </p>
<p>
      Alcibiades, who is described as a very young man, is about to enter on
      public life, having an inordinate opinion of himself, and an extravagant
      ambition. Socrates, 'who knows what is in man,' astonishes him by a
      revelation of his designs. But has he the knowledge which is necessary for
      carrying them out? He is going to persuade the Athenians—about what?
      Not about any particular art, but about politics—when to fight and
      when to make peace. Now, men should fight and make peace on just grounds,
      and therefore the question of justice and injustice must enter into peace
      and war; and he who advises the Athenians must know the difference between
      them. Does Alcibiades know? If he does, he must either have been taught by
      some master, or he must have discovered the nature of them himself. If he
      has had a master, Socrates would like to be informed who he is, that he
      may go and learn of him also. Alcibiades admits that he has never learned.
      Then has he enquired for himself? He may have, if he was ever aware of a
      time when he was ignorant. But he never was ignorant; for when he played
      with other boys at dice, he charged them with cheating, and this implied a
      knowledge of just and unjust. According to his own explanation, he had
      learned of the multitude. Why, he asks, should he not learn of them the
      nature of justice, as he has learned the Greek language of them? To this
      Socrates answers, that they can teach Greek, but they cannot teach
      justice; for they are agreed about the one, but they are not agreed about
      the other: and therefore Alcibiades, who has admitted that if he knows he
      must either have learned from a master or have discovered for himself the
      nature of justice, is convicted out of his own mouth.
    </p>
<p>
      Alcibiades rejoins, that the Athenians debate not about what is just, but
      about what is expedient; and he asserts that the two principles of justice
      and expediency are opposed. Socrates, by a series of questions, compels
      him to admit that the just and the expedient coincide. Alcibiades is thus
      reduced to the humiliating conclusion that he knows nothing of politics,
      even if, as he says, they are concerned with the expedient.
    </p>
<p>
      However, he is no worse than other Athenian statesmen; and he will not
      need training, for others are as ignorant as he is. He is reminded that he
      has to contend, not only with his own countrymen, but with their enemies—with
      the Spartan kings and with the great king of Persia; and he can only
      attain this higher aim of ambition by the assistance of Socrates. Not that
      Socrates himself professes to have attained the truth, but the questions
      which he asks bring others to a knowledge of themselves, and this is the
      first step in the practice of virtue.
    </p>
<p>
      The dialogue continues:—We wish to become as good as possible. But
      to be good in what? Alcibiades replies—'Good in transacting
      business.' But what business? 'The business of the most intelligent men at
      Athens.' The cobbler is intelligent in shoemaking, and is therefore good
      in that; he is not intelligent, and therefore not good, in weaving. Is he
      good in the sense which Alcibiades means, who is also bad? 'I mean,'
      replies Alcibiades, 'the man who is able to command in the city.' But to
      command what—horses or men? and if men, under what circumstances? 'I
      mean to say, that he is able to command men living in social and political
      relations.' And what is their aim? 'The better preservation of the city.'
      But when is a city better? 'When there is unanimity, such as exists
      between husband and wife.' Then, when husbands and wives perform their own
      special duties, there can be no unanimity between them; nor can a city be
      well ordered when each citizen does his own work only. Alcibiades, having
      stated first that goodness consists in the unanimity of the citizens, and
      then in each of them doing his own separate work, is brought to the
      required point of self-contradiction, leading him to confess his own
      ignorance.
    </p>
<p>
      But he is not too old to learn, and may still arrive at the truth, if he
      is willing to be cross-examined by Socrates. He must know himself; that is
      to say, not his body, or the things of the body, but his mind, or truer
      self. The physician knows the body, and the tradesman knows his own
      business, but they do not necessarily know themselves. Self-knowledge can
      be obtained only by looking into the mind and virtue of the soul, which is
      the diviner part of a man, as we see our own image in another's eye. And
      if we do not know ourselves, we cannot know what belongs to ourselves or
      belongs to others, and are unfit to take a part in political affairs. Both
      for the sake of the individual and of the state, we ought to aim at
      justice and temperance, not at wealth or power. The evil and unjust should
      have no power,—they should be the slaves of better men than
      themselves. None but the virtuous are deserving of freedom.
    </p>
<p>
      And are you, Alcibiades, a freeman? 'I feel that I am not; but I hope,
      Socrates, that by your aid I may become free, and from this day forward I
      will never leave you.'
    </p>
<p>
      The Alcibiades has several points of resemblance to the undoubted
      dialogues of Plato. The process of interrogation is of the same kind with
      that which Socrates practises upon the youthful Cleinias in the
      Euthydemus; and he characteristically attributes to Alcibiades the answers
      which he has elicited from him. The definition of good is narrowed by
      successive questions, and virtue is shown to be identical with knowledge.
      Here, as elsewhere, Socrates awakens the consciousness not of sin but of
      ignorance. Self-humiliation is the first step to knowledge, even of the
      commonest things. No man knows how ignorant he is, and no man can arrive
      at virtue and wisdom who has not once in his life, at least, been
      convicted of error. The process by which the soul is elevated is not
      unlike that which religious writers describe under the name of
      'conversion,' if we substitute the sense of ignorance for the
      consciousness of sin.
    </p>
<p>
      In some respects the dialogue differs from any other Platonic composition.
      The aim is more directly ethical and hortatory; the process by which the
      antagonist is undermined is simpler than in other Platonic writings, and
      the conclusion more decided. There is a good deal of humour in the manner
      in which the pride of Alcibiades, and of the Greeks generally, is supposed
      to be taken down by the Spartan and Persian queens; and the dialogue has
      considerable dialectical merit. But we have a difficulty in supposing that
      the same writer, who has given so profound and complex a notion of the
      characters both of Alcibiades and Socrates in the Symposium, should have
      treated them in so thin and superficial a manner in the Alcibiades, or
      that he would have ascribed to the ironical Socrates the rather unmeaning
      boast that Alcibiades could not attain the objects of his ambition without
      his help; or that he should have imagined that a mighty nature like his
      could have been reformed by a few not very conclusive words of Socrates.
      For the arguments by which Alcibiades is reformed are not convincing; the
      writer of the dialogue, whoever he was, arrives at his idealism by crooked
      and tortuous paths, in which many pitfalls are concealed. The anachronism
      of making Alcibiades about twenty years old during the life of his uncle,
      Pericles, may be noted; and the repetition of the favourite observation,
      which occurs also in the Laches and Protagoras, that great Athenian
      statesmen, like Pericles, failed in the education of their sons. There is
      none of the undoubted dialogues of Plato in which there is so little
      dramatic verisimilitude.

      PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: Alcibiades, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: I dare say that you may be surprised to find, O son of Cleinias,
      that I, who am your first lover, not having spoken to you for many years,
      when the rest of the world were wearying you with their attentions, am the
      last of your lovers who still speaks to you. The cause of my silence has
      been that I was hindered by a power more than human, of which I will some
      day explain to you the nature; this impediment has now been removed; I
      therefore here present myself before you, and I greatly hope that no
      similar hindrance will again occur. Meanwhile, I have observed that your
      pride has been too much for the pride of your admirers; they were numerous
      and high-spirited, but they have all run away, overpowered by your
      superior force of character; not one of them remains. And I want you to
      understand the reason why you have been too much for them. You think that
      you have no need of them or of any other man, for you have great
      possessions and lack nothing, beginning with the body, and ending with the
      soul. In the first place, you say to yourself that you are the fairest and
      tallest of the citizens, and this every one who has eyes may see to be
      true; in the second place, that you are among the noblest of them, highly
      connected both on the father's and the mother's side, and sprung from one
      of the most distinguished families in your own state, which is the
      greatest in Hellas, and having many friends and kinsmen of the best sort,
      who can assist you when in need; and there is one potent relative, who is
      more to you than all the rest, Pericles the son of Xanthippus, whom your
      father left guardian of you, and of your brother, and who can do as he
      pleases not only in this city, but in all Hellas, and among many and
      mighty barbarous nations. Moreover, you are rich; but I must say that you
      value yourself least of all upon your possessions. And all these things
      have lifted you up; you have overcome your lovers, and they have
      acknowledged that you were too much for them. Have you not remarked their
      absence? And now I know that you wonder why I, unlike the rest of them,
      have not gone away, and what can be my motive in remaining.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Perhaps, Socrates, you are not aware that I was just going to
      ask you the very same question—What do you want? And what is your
      motive in annoying me, and always, wherever I am, making a point of
      coming? (Compare Symp.) I do really wonder what you mean, and should
      greatly like to know.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then if, as you say, you desire to know, I suppose that you will
      be willing to hear, and I may consider myself to be speaking to an auditor
      who will remain, and will not run away?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly, let me hear.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You had better be careful, for I may very likely be as unwilling
      to end as I have hitherto been to begin.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Proceed, my good man, and I will listen.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: I will proceed; and, although no lover likes to speak with one
      who has no feeling of love in him (compare Symp.), I will make an effort,
      and tell you what I meant: My love, Alcibiades, which I hardly like to
      confess, would long ago have passed away, as I flatter myself, if I saw
      you loving your good things, or thinking that you ought to pass life in
      the enjoyment of them. But I shall reveal other thoughts of yours, which
      you keep to yourself; whereby you will know that I have always had my eye
      on you. Suppose that at this moment some God came to you and said:
      Alcibiades, will you live as you are, or die in an instant if you are
      forbidden to make any further acquisition?—I verily believe that you
      would choose death. And I will tell you the hope in which you are at
      present living: Before many days have elapsed, you think that you will
      come before the Athenian assembly, and will prove to them that you are
      more worthy of honour than Pericles, or any other man that ever lived, and
      having proved this, you will have the greatest power in the state. When
      you have gained the greatest power among us, you will go on to other
      Hellenic states, and not only to Hellenes, but to all the barbarians who
      inhabit the same continent with us. And if the God were then to say to you
      again: Here in Europe is to be your seat of empire, and you must not cross
      over into Asia or meddle with Asiatic affairs, I do not believe that you
      would choose to live upon these terms; but the world, as I may say, must
      be filled with your power and name—no man less than Cyrus and Xerxes
      is of any account with you. Such I know to be your hopes—I am not
      guessing only—and very likely you, who know that I am speaking the
      truth, will reply, Well, Socrates, but what have my hopes to do with the
      explanation which you promised of your unwillingness to leave me? And that
      is what I am now going to tell you, sweet son of Cleinias and Dinomache.
      The explanation is, that all these designs of yours cannot be accomplished
      by you without my help; so great is the power which I believe myself to
      have over you and your concerns; and this I conceive to be the reason why
      the God has hitherto forbidden me to converse with you, and I have been
      long expecting his permission. For, as you hope to prove your own great
      value to the state, and having proved it, to attain at once to absolute
      power, so do I indulge a hope that I shall be the supreme power over you,
      if I am able to prove my own great value to you, and to show you that
      neither guardian, nor kinsman, nor any one is able to deliver into your
      hands the power which you desire, but I only, God being my helper. When
      you were young (compare Symp.) and your hopes were not yet matured, I
      should have wasted my time, and therefore, as I conceive, the God forbade
      me to converse with you; but now, having his permission, I will speak, for
      now you will listen to me.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Your silence, Socrates, was always a surprise to me. I never
      could understand why you followed me about, and now that you have begun to
      speak again, I am still more amazed. Whether I think all this or not, is a
      matter about which you seem to have already made up your mind, and
      therefore my denial will have no effect upon you. But granting, if I must,
      that you have perfectly divined my purposes, why is your assistance
      necessary to the attainment of them? Can you tell me why?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You want to know whether I can make a long speech, such as you
      are in the habit of hearing; but that is not my way. I think, however,
      that I can prove to you the truth of what I am saying, if you will grant
      me one little favour.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes, if the favour which you mean be not a troublesome one.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Will you be troubled at having questions to answer?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Not at all.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then please to answer.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Ask me.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Have you not the intention which I attribute to you?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I will grant anything you like, in the hope of hearing what
      more you have to say.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You do, then, mean, as I was saying, to come forward in a little
      while in the character of an adviser of the Athenians? And suppose that
      when you are ascending the bema, I pull you by the sleeve and say,
      Alcibiades, you are getting up to advise the Athenians—do you know
      the matter about which they are going to deliberate, better than they?—How
      would you answer?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I should reply, that I was going to advise them about a matter
      which I do know better than they.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then you are a good adviser about the things which you know?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And do you know anything but what you have learned of others, or
      found out yourself?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is all.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And would you have ever learned or discovered anything, if you
      had not been willing either to learn of others or to examine yourself?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I should not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And would you have been willing to learn or to examine what you
      supposed that you knew?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then there was a time when you thought that you did not know
      what you are now supposed to know?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: I think that I know tolerably well the extent of your
      acquirements; and you must tell me if I forget any of them: according to
      my recollection, you learned the arts of writing, of playing on the lyre,
      and of wrestling; the flute you never would learn; this is the sum of your
      accomplishments, unless there were some which you acquired in secret; and
      I think that secrecy was hardly possible, as you could not have come out
      of your door, either by day or night, without my seeing you.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes, that was the whole of my schooling.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And are you going to get up in the Athenian assembly, and give
      them advice about writing?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No, indeed.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Or about the touch of the lyre?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And they are not in the habit of deliberating about wrestling,
      in the assembly?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Hardly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then what are the deliberations in which you propose to advise
      them? Surely not about building?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: For the builder will advise better than you will about that?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: He will.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Nor about divination?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: About that again the diviner will advise better than you will?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Whether he be little or great, good or ill-looking, noble or
      ignoble—makes no difference.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: A man is a good adviser about anything, not because he has
      riches, but because he has knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Assuredly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Whether their counsellor is rich or poor, is not a matter which
      will make any difference to the Athenians when they are deliberating about
      the health of the citizens; they only require that he should be a
      physician.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Of course.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then what will be the subject of deliberation about which you
      will be justified in getting up and advising them?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: About their own concerns, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You mean about shipbuilding, for example, when the question is
      what sort of ships they ought to build?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No, I should not advise them about that.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: I suppose, because you do not understand shipbuilding:—is
      that the reason?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: It is.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then about what concerns of theirs will you advise them?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: About war, Socrates, or about peace, or about any other
      concerns of the state.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You mean, when they deliberate with whom they ought to make
      peace, and with whom they ought to go to war, and in what manner?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And they ought to go to war with those against whom it is better
      to go to war?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And when it is better?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And for as long a time as is better?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But suppose the Athenians to deliberate with whom they ought to
      close in wrestling, and whom they should grasp by the hand, would you, or
      the master of gymnastics, be a better adviser of them?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Clearly, the master of gymnastics.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And can you tell me on what grounds the master of gymnastics
      would decide, with whom they ought or ought not to close, and when and
      how? To take an instance: Would he not say that they should wrestle with
      those against whom it is best to wrestle?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And as much as is best?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And at such times as are best?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Again; you sometimes accompany the lyre with the song and dance?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: When it is well to do so?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And as much as is well?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Just so.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And as you speak of an excellence or art of the best in
      wrestling, and of an excellence in playing the lyre, I wish you would tell
      me what this latter is;—the excellence of wrestling I call
      gymnastic, and I want to know what you call the other.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I do not understand you.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then try to do as I do; for the answer which I gave is
      universally right, and when I say right, I mean according to rule.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And was not the art of which I spoke gymnastic?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And I called the excellence in wrestling gymnastic?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: You did.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And I was right?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I think that you were.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Well, now,—for you should learn to argue prettily—let
      me ask you in return to tell me, first, what is that art of which playing
      and singing, and stepping properly in the dance, are parts,—what is
      the name of the whole? I think that by this time you must be able to tell.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Indeed I cannot.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then let me put the matter in another way: what do you call the
      Goddesses who are the patronesses of art?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: The Muses do you mean, Socrates?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Yes, I do; and what is the name of the art which is called after
      them?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I suppose that you mean music.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Yes, that is my meaning; and what is the excellence of the art
      of music, as I told you truly that the excellence of wrestling was
      gymnastic—what is the excellence of music—to be what?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: To be musical, I suppose.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Very good; and now please to tell me what is the excellence of
      war and peace; as the more musical was the more excellent, or the more
      gymnastical was the more excellent, tell me, what name do you give to the
      more excellent in war and peace?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: But I really cannot tell you.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But if you were offering advice to another and said to him—This
      food is better than that, at this time and in this quantity, and he said
      to you—What do you mean, Alcibiades, by the word 'better'? you would
      have no difficulty in replying that you meant 'more wholesome,' although
      you do not profess to be a physician: and when the subject is one of which
      you profess to have knowledge, and about which you are ready to get up and
      advise as if you knew, are you not ashamed, when you are asked, not to be
      able to answer the question? Is it not disgraceful?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Very.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Well, then, consider and try to explain what is the meaning of
      'better,' in the matter of making peace and going to war with those
      against whom you ought to go to war? To what does the word refer?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I am thinking, and I cannot tell.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But you surely know what are the charges which we bring against
      one another, when we arrive at the point of making war, and what name we
      give them?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes, certainly; we say that deceit or violence has been
      employed, or that we have been defrauded.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And how does this happen? Will you tell me how? For there may be
      a difference in the manner.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Do you mean by 'how,' Socrates, whether we suffered these
      things justly or unjustly?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Exactly.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: There can be no greater difference than between just and
      unjust.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And would you advise the Athenians to go to war with the just or
      with the unjust?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is an awkward question; for certainly, even if a person
      did intend to go to war with the just, he would not admit that they were
      just.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: He would not go to war, because it would be unlawful?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Neither lawful nor honourable.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then you, too, would address them on principles of justice?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: What, then, is justice but that better, of which I spoke, in
      going to war or not going to war with those against whom we ought or ought
      not, and when we ought or ought not to go to war?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But how is this, friend Alcibiades? Have you forgotten that you
      do not know this, or have you been to the schoolmaster without my
      knowledge, and has he taught you to discern the just from the unjust? Who
      is he? I wish you would tell me, that I may go and learn of him—you
      shall introduce me.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: You are mocking, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: No, indeed; I most solemnly declare to you by Zeus, who is the
      God of our common friendship, and whom I never will forswear, that I am
      not; tell me, then, who this instructor is, if he exists.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: But, perhaps, he does not exist; may I not have acquired the
      knowledge of just and unjust in some other way?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Yes; if you have discovered them.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: But do you not think that I could discover them?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: I am sure that you might, if you enquired about them.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: And do you not think that I would enquire?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Yes; if you thought that you did not know them.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: And was there not a time when I did so think?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Very good; and can you tell me how long it is since you thought
      that you did not know the nature of the just and the unjust? What do you
      say to a year ago? Were you then in a state of conscious ignorance and
      enquiry? Or did you think that you knew? And please to answer truly, that
      our discussion may not be in vain.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Well, I thought that I knew.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And two years ago, and three years ago, and four years ago, you
      knew all the same?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I did.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And more than four years ago you were a child—were you
      not?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And then I am quite sure that you thought you knew.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Why are you so sure?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Because I often heard you when a child, in your teacher's house,
      or elsewhere, playing at dice or some other game with the boys, not
      hesitating at all about the nature of the just and unjust; but very
      confident—crying and shouting that one of the boys was a rogue and a
      cheat, and had been cheating. Is it not true?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: But what was I to do, Socrates, when anybody cheated me?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And how can you say, 'What was I to do'? if at the time you did
      not know whether you were wronged or not?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: To be sure I knew; I was quite aware that I was being cheated.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then you suppose yourself even when a child to have known the
      nature of just and unjust?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly; and I did know then.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And when did you discover them—not, surely, at the time
      when you thought that you knew them?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And when did you think that you were ignorant—if you
      consider, you will find that there never was such a time?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Really, Socrates, I cannot say.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then you did not learn them by discovering them?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Clearly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But just before you said that you did not know them by learning;
      now, if you have neither discovered nor learned them, how and whence do
      you come to know them?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I suppose that I was mistaken in saying that I knew them
      through my own discovery of them; whereas, in truth, I learned them in the
      same way that other people learn.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: So you said before, and I must again ask, of whom? Do tell me.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Of the many.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Do you take refuge in them? I cannot say much for your teachers.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Why, are they not able to teach?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: They could not teach you how to play at draughts, which you
      would acknowledge (would you not) to be a much smaller matter than
      justice?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And can they teach the better who are unable to teach the worse?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I think that they can; at any rate, they can teach many far
      better things than to play at draughts.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: What things?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Why, for example, I learned to speak Greek of them, and I
      cannot say who was my teacher, or to whom I am to attribute my knowledge
      of Greek, if not to those good-for-nothing teachers, as you call them.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Why, yes, my friend; and the many are good enough teachers of
      Greek, and some of their instructions in that line may be justly praised.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Why is that?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Why, because they have the qualities which good teachers ought
      to have.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: What qualities?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Why, you know that knowledge is the first qualification of any
      teacher?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And if they know, they must agree together and not differ?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And would you say that they knew the things about which they
      differ?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then how can they teach them?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: They cannot.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Well, but do you imagine that the many would differ about the
      nature of wood and stone? are they not agreed if you ask them what they
      are? and do they not run to fetch the same thing, when they want a piece
      of wood or a stone? And so in similar cases, which I suspect to be pretty
      nearly all that you mean by speaking Greek.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: These, as we were saying, are matters about which they are
      agreed with one another and with themselves; both individuals and states
      use the same words about them; they do not use some one word and some
      another.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: They do not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then they may be expected to be good teachers of these things?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And if we want to instruct any one in them, we shall be right in
      sending him to be taught by our friends the many?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But if we wanted further to know not only which are men and
      which are horses, but which men or horses have powers of running, would
      the many still be able to inform us?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And you have a sufficient proof that they do not know these
      things and are not the best teachers of them, inasmuch as they are never
      agreed about them?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And suppose that we wanted to know not only what men are like,
      but what healthy or diseased men are like—would the many be able to
      teach us?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: They would not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And you would have a proof that they were bad teachers of these
      matters, if you saw them at variance?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I should.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Well, but are the many agreed with themselves, or with one
      another, about the justice or injustice of men and things?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Assuredly not, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: There is no subject about which they are more at variance?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: None.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: I do not suppose that you ever saw or heard of men quarrelling
      over the principles of health and disease to such an extent as to go to
      war and kill one another for the sake of them?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No indeed.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But of the quarrels about justice and injustice, even if you
      have never seen them, you have certainly heard from many people, including
      Homer; for you have heard of the Iliad and Odyssey?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: To be sure, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: A difference of just and unjust is the argument of those poems?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Which difference caused all the wars and deaths of Trojans and
      Achaeans, and the deaths of the suitors of Penelope in their quarrel with
      Odysseus.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And when the Athenians and Lacedaemonians and Boeotians fell at
      Tanagra, and afterwards in the battle of Coronea, at which your father
      Cleinias met his end, the question was one of justice—this was the
      sole cause of the battles, and of their deaths.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But can they be said to understand that about which they are
      quarrelling to the death?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Clearly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And yet those whom you thus allow to be ignorant are the
      teachers to whom you are appealing.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But how are you ever likely to know the nature of justice and
      injustice, about which you are so perplexed, if you have neither learned
      them of others nor discovered them yourself?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: From what you say, I suppose not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: See, again, how inaccurately you speak, Alcibiades!
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: In what respect?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: In saying that I say so.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Why, did you not say that I know nothing of the just and
      unjust?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: No; I did not.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Did I, then?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: How was that?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Let me explain. Suppose I were to ask you which is the greater
      number, two or one; you would reply 'two'?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I should.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And by how much greater?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: By one.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Which of us now says that two is more than one?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I do.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Did not I ask, and you answer the question?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then who is speaking? I who put the question, or you who answer
      me?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I am.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Or suppose that I ask and you tell me the letters which make up
      the name Socrates, which of us is the speaker?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I am.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Now let us put the case generally: whenever there is a question
      and answer, who is the speaker,—the questioner or the answerer?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I should say, Socrates, that the answerer was the speaker.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And have I not been the questioner all through?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And you the answerer?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Just so.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Which of us, then, was the speaker?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: The inference is, Socrates, that I was the speaker.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Did not some one say that Alcibiades, the fair son of Cleinias,
      not understanding about just and unjust, but thinking that he did
      understand, was going to the assembly to advise the Athenians about what
      he did not know? Was not that said?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then, Alcibiades, the result may be expressed in the language of
      Euripides. I think that you have heard all this 'from yourself, and not
      from me'; nor did I say this, which you erroneously attribute to me, but
      you yourself, and what you said was very true. For indeed, my dear fellow,
      the design which you meditate of teaching what you do not know, and have
      not taken any pains to learn, is downright insanity.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: But, Socrates, I think that the Athenians and the rest of the
      Hellenes do not often advise as to the more just or unjust; for they see
      no difficulty in them, and therefore they leave them, and consider which
      course of action will be most expedient; for there is a difference between
      justice and expediency. Many persons have done great wrong and profited by
      their injustice; others have done rightly and come to no good.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Well, but granting that the just and the expedient are ever so
      much opposed, you surely do not imagine that you know what is expedient
      for mankind, or why a thing is expedient?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Why not, Socrates?—But I am not going to be asked again
      from whom I learned, or when I made the discovery.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: What a way you have! When you make a mistake which might be
      refuted by a previous argument, you insist on having a new and different
      refutation; the old argument is a worn-our garment which you will no
      longer put on, but some one must produce another which is clean and new.
      Now I shall disregard this move of yours, and shall ask over again,—Where
      did you learn and how do you know the nature of the expedient, and who is
      your teacher? All this I comprehend in a single question, and now you will
      manifestly be in the old difficulty, and will not be able to show that you
      know the expedient, either because you learned or because you discovered
      it yourself. But, as I perceive that you are dainty, and dislike the taste
      of a stale argument, I will enquire no further into your knowledge of what
      is expedient or what is not expedient for the Athenian people, and simply
      request you to say why you do not explain whether justice and expediency
      are the same or different? And if you like you may examine me as I have
      examined you, or, if you would rather, you may carry on the discussion by
      yourself.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: But I am not certain, Socrates, whether I shall be able to
      discuss the matter with you.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then imagine, my dear fellow, that I am the demus and the
      ecclesia; for in the ecclesia, too, you will have to persuade men
      individually.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And is not the same person able to persuade one individual
      singly and many individuals of the things which he knows? The grammarian,
      for example, can persuade one and he can persuade many about letters.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And about number, will not the same person persuade one and
      persuade many?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And this will be he who knows number, or the arithmetician?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Quite true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And cannot you persuade one man about that of which you can
      persuade many?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I suppose so.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And that of which you can persuade either is clearly what you
      know?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And the only difference between one who argues as we are doing,
      and the orator who is addressing an assembly, is that the one seeks to
      persuade a number, and the other an individual, of the same things.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I suppose so.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Well, then, since the same person who can persuade a multitude
      can persuade individuals, try conclusions upon me, and prove to me that
      the just is not always expedient.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: You take liberties, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: I shall take the liberty of proving to you the opposite of that
      which you will not prove to me.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Proceed.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Answer my questions—that is all.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Nay, I should like you to be the speaker.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: What, do you not wish to be persuaded?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly I do.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And can you be persuaded better than out of your own mouth?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I think not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then you shall answer; and if you do not hear the words, that
      the just is the expedient, coming from your own lips, never believe
      another man again.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I won't; but answer I will, for I do not see how I can come to
      any harm.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: A true prophecy! Let me begin then by enquiring of you whether
      you allow that the just is sometimes expedient and sometimes not?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And sometimes honourable and sometimes not?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: What do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: I am asking if you ever knew any one who did what was
      dishonourable and yet just?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Never.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: All just things are honourable?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And are honourable things sometimes good and sometimes not good,
      or are they always good?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I rather think, Socrates, that some honourable things are
      evil.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And are some dishonourable things good?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You mean in such a case as the following:—In time of war,
      men have been wounded or have died in rescuing a companion or kinsman,
      when others who have neglected the duty of rescuing them have escaped in
      safety?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And to rescue another under such circumstances is honourable, in
      respect of the attempt to save those whom we ought to save; and this is
      courage?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But evil in respect of death and wounds?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And the courage which is shown in the rescue is one thing, and
      the death another?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then the rescue of one's friends is honourable in one point of
      view, but evil in another?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And if honourable, then also good: Will you consider now whether
      I may not be right, for you were acknowledging that the courage which is
      shown in the rescue is honourable? Now is this courage good or evil? Look
      at the matter thus: which would you rather choose, good or evil?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Good.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And the greatest goods you would be most ready to choose, and
      would least like to be deprived of them?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: What would you say of courage? At what price would you be
      willing to be deprived of courage?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I would rather die than be a coward.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then you think that cowardice is the worst of evils?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I do.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: As bad as death, I suppose?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And life and courage are the extreme opposites of death and
      cowardice?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And they are what you would most desire to have, and their
      opposites you would least desire?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Is this because you think life and courage the best, and death
      and cowardice the worst?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And you would term the rescue of a friend in battle honourable,
      in as much as courage does a good work?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I should.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But evil because of the death which ensues?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Might we not describe their different effects as follows:—You
      may call either of them evil in respect of the evil which is the result,
      and good in respect of the good which is the result of either of them?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And they are honourable in so far as they are good, and
      dishonourable in so far as they are evil?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then when you say that the rescue of a friend in battle is
      honourable and yet evil, that is equivalent to saying that the rescue is
      good and yet evil?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I believe that you are right, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Nothing honourable, regarded as honourable, is evil; nor
      anything base, regarded as base, good.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Clearly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Look at the matter yet once more in a further light: he who acts
      honourably acts well?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And he who acts well is happy?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Of course.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And the happy are those who obtain good?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And they obtain good by acting well and honourably?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then acting well is a good?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And happiness is a good?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then the good and the honourable are again identified.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Manifestly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then, if the argument holds, what we find to be honourable we
      shall also find to be good?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And is the good expedient or not?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Expedient.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Do you remember our admissions about the just?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes; if I am not mistaken, we said that those who acted justly
      must also act honourably.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And the honourable is the good?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And the good is expedient?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then, Alcibiades, the just is expedient?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I should infer so.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And all this I prove out of your own mouth, for I ask and you
      answer?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I must acknowledge it to be true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And having acknowledged that the just is the same as the
      expedient, are you not (let me ask) prepared to ridicule any one who,
      pretending to understand the principles of justice and injustice, gets up
      to advise the noble Athenians or the ignoble Peparethians, that the just
      may be the evil?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I solemnly declare, Socrates, that I do not know what I am
      saying. Verily, I am in a strange state, for when you put questions to me
      I am of different minds in successive instants.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And are you not aware of the nature of this perplexity, my
      friend?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Indeed I am not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Do you suppose that if some one were to ask you whether you have
      two eyes or three, or two hands or four, or anything of that sort, you
      would then be of different minds in successive instants?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I begin to distrust myself, but still I do not suppose that I
      should.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You would feel no doubt; and for this reason—because you
      would know?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I suppose so.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And the reason why you involuntarily contradict yourself is
      clearly that you are ignorant?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Very likely.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And if you are perplexed in answering about just and unjust,
      honourable and dishonourable, good and evil, expedient and inexpedient,
      the reason is that you are ignorant of them, and therefore in perplexity.
      Is not that clear?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I agree.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But is this always the case, and is a man necessarily perplexed
      about that of which he has no knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly he is.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And do you know how to ascend into heaven?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And in this case, too, is your judgment perplexed?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Do you see the reason why, or shall I tell you?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Tell me.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: The reason is, that you not only do not know, my friend, but you
      do not think that you know.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: There again; what do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Ask yourself; are you in any perplexity about things of which
      you are ignorant? You know, for example, that you know nothing about the
      preparation of food.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And do you think and perplex yourself about the preparation of
      food: or do you leave that to some one who understands the art?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: The latter.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Or if you were on a voyage, would you bewilder yourself by
      considering whether the rudder is to be drawn inwards or outwards, or do
      you leave that to the pilot, and do nothing?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: It would be the concern of the pilot.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then you are not perplexed about what you do not know, if you
      know that you do not know it?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I imagine not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Do you not see, then, that mistakes in life and practice are
      likewise to be attributed to the ignorance which has conceit of knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Once more, what do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: I suppose that we begin to act when we think that we know what
      we are doing?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But when people think that they do not know, they entrust their
      business to others?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And so there is a class of ignorant persons who do not make
      mistakes in life, because they trust others about things of which they are
      ignorant?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Who, then, are the persons who make mistakes? They cannot, of
      course, be those who know?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But if neither those who know, nor those who know that they do
      not know, make mistakes, there remain those only who do not know and think
      that they know.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes, only those.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then this is ignorance of the disgraceful sort which is
      mischievous?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And most mischievous and most disgraceful when having to do with
      the greatest matters?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: By far.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And can there be any matters greater than the just, the
      honourable, the good, and the expedient?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: There cannot be.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And these, as you were saying, are what perplex you?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But if you are perplexed, then, as the previous argument has
      shown, you are not only ignorant of the greatest matters, but being
      ignorant you fancy that you know them?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I fear that you are right.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And now see what has happened to you, Alcibiades! I hardly like
      to speak of your evil case, but as we are alone I will: My good friend,
      you are wedded to ignorance of the most disgraceful kind, and of this you
      are convicted, not by me, but out of your own mouth and by your own
      argument; wherefore also you rush into politics before you are educated.
      Neither is your case to be deemed singular. For I might say the same of
      almost all our statesmen, with the exception, perhaps of your guardian,
      Pericles.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes, Socrates; and Pericles is said not to have got his wisdom
      by the light of nature, but to have associated with several of the
      philosophers; with Pythocleides, for example, and with Anaxagoras, and now
      in advanced life with Damon, in the hope of gaining wisdom.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Very good; but did you ever know a man wise in anything who was
      unable to impart his particular wisdom? For example, he who taught you
      letters was not only wise, but he made you and any others whom he liked
      wise.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And you, whom he taught, can do the same?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And in like manner the harper and gymnastic-master?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: When a person is enabled to impart knowledge to another, he
      thereby gives an excellent proof of his own understanding of any matter.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I agree.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Well, and did Pericles make any one wise; did he begin by making
      his sons wise?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: But, Socrates, if the two sons of Pericles were simpletons,
      what has that to do with the matter?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Well, but did he make your brother, Cleinias, wise?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Cleinias is a madman; there is no use in talking of him.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But if Cleinias is a madman and the two sons of Pericles were
      simpletons, what reason can be given why he neglects you, and lets you be
      as you are?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I believe that I am to blame for not listening to him.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But did you ever hear of any other Athenian or foreigner, bond
      or free, who was deemed to have grown wiser in the society of Pericles,—as
      I might cite Pythodorus, the son of Isolochus, and Callias, the son of
      Calliades, who have grown wiser in the society of Zeno, for which
      privilege they have each of them paid him the sum of a hundred minae
      (about 406 pounds sterling) to the increase of their wisdom and fame.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I certainly never did hear of any one.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Well, and in reference to your own case, do you mean to remain
      as you are, or will you take some pains about yourself?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: With your aid, Socrates, I will. And indeed, when I hear you
      speak, the truth of what you are saying strikes home to me, and I agree
      with you, for our statesmen, all but a few, do appear to be quite
      uneducated.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: What is the inference?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Why, that if they were educated they would be trained
      athletes, and he who means to rival them ought to have knowledge and
      experience when he attacks them; but now, as they have become politicians
      without any special training, why should I have the trouble of learning
      and practising? For I know well that by the light of nature I shall get
      the better of them.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: My dear friend, what a sentiment! And how unworthy of your noble
      form and your high estate!
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: What do you mean, Socrates; why do you say so?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: I am grieved when I think of our mutual love.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: At what?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: At your fancying that the contest on which you are entering is
      with people here.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Why, what others are there?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Is that a question which a magnanimous soul should ask?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Do you mean to say that the contest is not with these?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And suppose that you were going to steer a ship into action,
      would you only aim at being the best pilot on board? Would you not, while
      acknowledging that you must possess this degree of excellence, rather look
      to your antagonists, and not, as you are now doing, to your fellow
      combatants? You ought to be so far above these latter, that they will not
      even dare to be your rivals; and, being regarded by you as inferiors, will
      do battle for you against the enemy; this is the kind of superiority which
      you must establish over them, if you mean to accomplish any noble action
      really worthy of yourself and of the state.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That would certainly be my aim.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Verily, then, you have good reason to be satisfied, if you are
      better than the soldiers; and you need not, when you are their superior
      and have your thoughts and actions fixed upon them, look away to the
      generals of the enemy.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Of whom are you speaking, Socrates?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Why, you surely know that our city goes to war now and then with
      the Lacedaemonians and with the great king?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True enough.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And if you meant to be the ruler of this city, would you not be
      right in considering that the Lacedaemonian and Persian king were your
      true rivals?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I believe that you are right.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Oh no, my friend, I am quite wrong, and I think that you ought
      rather to turn your attention to Midias the quail-breeder and others like
      him, who manage our politics; in whom, as the women would remark, you may
      still see the slaves' cut of hair, cropping out in their minds as well as
      on their pates; and they come with their barbarous lingo to flatter us and
      not to rule us. To these, I say, you should look, and then you need not
      trouble yourself about your own fitness to contend in such a noble arena:
      there is no reason why you should either learn what has to be learned, or
      practise what has to be practised, and only when thoroughly prepared enter
      on a political career.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: There, I think, Socrates, that you are right; I do not
      suppose, however, that the Spartan generals or the great king are really
      different from anybody else.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But, my dear friend, do consider what you are saying.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: What am I to consider?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: In the first place, will you be more likely to take care of
      yourself, if you are in a wholesome fear and dread of them, or if you are
      not?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Clearly, if I have such a fear of them.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And do you think that you will sustain any injury if you take
      care of yourself?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No, I shall be greatly benefited.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And this is one very important respect in which that notion of
      yours is bad.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: In the next place, consider that what you say is probably false.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: How so?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Let me ask you whether better natures are likely to be found in
      noble races or not in noble races?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Clearly in noble races.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Are not those who are well born and well bred most likely to be
      perfect in virtue?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then let us compare our antecedents with those of the
      Lacedaemonian and Persian kings; are they inferior to us in descent? Have
      we not heard that the former are sprung from Heracles, and the latter from
      Achaemenes, and that the race of Heracles and the race of Achaemenes go
      back to Perseus, son of Zeus?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Why, so does mine go back to Eurysaces, and he to Zeus!
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And mine, noble Alcibiades, to Daedalus, and he to Hephaestus,
      son of Zeus. But, for all that, we are far inferior to them. For they are
      descended 'from Zeus,' through a line of kings—either kings of Argos
      and Lacedaemon, or kings of Persia, a country which the descendants of
      Achaemenes have always possessed, besides being at various times
      sovereigns of Asia, as they now are; whereas, we and our fathers were but
      private persons. How ridiculous would you be thought if you were to make a
      display of your ancestors and of Salamis the island of Eurysaces, or of
      Aegina, the habitation of the still more ancient Aeacus, before
      Artaxerxes, son of Xerxes. You should consider how inferior we are to them
      both in the derivation of our birth and in other particulars. Did you
      never observe how great is the property of the Spartan kings? And their
      wives are under the guardianship of the Ephori, who are public officers
      and watch over them, in order to preserve as far as possible the purity of
      the Heracleid blood. Still greater is the difference among the Persians;
      for no one entertains a suspicion that the father of a prince of Persia
      can be any one but the king. Such is the awe which invests the person of
      the queen, that any other guard is needless. And when the heir of the
      kingdom is born, all the subjects of the king feast; and the day of his
      birth is for ever afterwards kept as a holiday and time of sacrifice by
      all Asia; whereas, when you and I were born, Alcibiades, as the comic poet
      says, the neighbours hardly knew of the important event. After the birth
      of the royal child, he is tended, not by a good-for-nothing woman-nurse,
      but by the best of the royal eunuchs, who are charged with the care of
      him, and especially with the fashioning and right formation of his limbs,
      in order that he may be as shapely as possible; which being their calling,
      they are held in great honour. And when the young prince is seven years
      old he is put upon a horse and taken to the riding-masters, and begins to
      go out hunting. And at fourteen years of age he is handed over to the
      royal schoolmasters, as they are termed: these are four chosen men,
      reputed to be the best among the Persians of a certain age; and one of
      them is the wisest, another the justest, a third the most temperate, and a
      fourth the most valiant. The first instructs him in the magianism of
      Zoroaster, the son of Oromasus, which is the worship of the Gods, and
      teaches him also the duties of his royal office; the second, who is the
      justest, teaches him always to speak the truth; the third, or most
      temperate, forbids him to allow any pleasure to be lord over him, that he
      may be accustomed to be a freeman and king indeed,—lord of himself
      first, and not a slave; the most valiant trains him to be bold and
      fearless, telling him that if he fears he is to deem himself a slave;
      whereas Pericles gave you, Alcibiades, for a tutor Zopyrus the Thracian, a
      slave of his who was past all other work. I might enlarge on the nurture
      and education of your rivals, but that would be tedious; and what I have
      said is a sufficient sample of what remains to be said. I have only to
      remark, by way of contrast, that no one cares about your birth or nurture
      or education, or, I may say, about that of any other Athenian, unless he
      has a lover who looks after him. And if you cast an eye on the wealth, the
      luxury, the garments with their flowing trains, the anointings with myrrh,
      the multitudes of attendants, and all the other bravery of the Persians,
      you will be ashamed when you discern your own inferiority; or if you look
      at the temperance and orderliness and ease and grace and magnanimity and
      courage and endurance and love of toil and desire of glory and ambition of
      the Lacedaemonians—in all these respects you will see that you are
      but a child in comparison of them. Even in the matter of wealth, if you
      value yourself upon that, I must reveal to you how you stand; for if you
      form an estimate of the wealth of the Lacedaemonians, you will see that
      our possessions fall far short of theirs. For no one here can compete with
      them either in the extent and fertility of their own and the Messenian
      territory, or in the number of their slaves, and especially of the Helots,
      or of their horses, or of the animals which feed on the Messenian
      pastures. But I have said enough of this: and as to gold and silver, there
      is more of them in Lacedaemon than in all the rest of Hellas, for during
      many generations gold has been always flowing in to them from the whole
      Hellenic world, and often from the barbarian also, and never going out, as
      in the fable of Aesop the fox said to the lion, 'The prints of the feet of
      those going in are distinct enough;' but who ever saw the trace of money
      going out of Lacedaemon? And therefore you may safely infer that the
      inhabitants are the richest of the Hellenes in gold and silver, and that
      their kings are the richest of them, for they have a larger share of these
      things, and they have also a tribute paid to them which is very
      considerable. Yet the Spartan wealth, though great in comparison of the
      wealth of the other Hellenes, is as nothing in comparison of that of the
      Persians and their kings. Why, I have been informed by a credible person
      who went up to the king (at Susa), that he passed through a large tract of
      excellent land, extending for nearly a day's journey, which the people of
      the country called the queen's girdle, and another, which they called her
      veil; and several other fair and fertile districts, which were reserved
      for the adornment of the queen, and are named after her several
      habiliments. Now, I cannot help thinking to myself, What if some one were
      to go to Amestris, the wife of Xerxes and mother of Artaxerxes, and say to
      her, There is a certain Dinomache, whose whole wardrobe is not worth fifty
      minae—and that will be more than the value—and she has a son
      who is possessed of a three-hundred acre patch at Erchiae, and he has a
      mind to go to war with your son—would she not wonder to what this
      Alcibiades trusts for success in the conflict? 'He must rely,' she would
      say to herself, 'upon his training and wisdom—these are the things
      which Hellenes value.' And if she heard that this Alcibiades who is making
      the attempt is not as yet twenty years old, and is wholly uneducated, and
      when his lover tells him that he ought to get education and training
      first, and then go and fight the king, he refuses, and says that he is
      well enough as he is, would she not be amazed, and ask 'On what, then,
      does the youth rely?' And if we replied: He relies on his beauty, and
      stature, and birth, and mental endowments, she would think that we were
      mad, Alcibiades, when she compared the advantages which you possess with
      those of her own people. And I believe that even Lampido, the daughter of
      Leotychides, the wife of Archidamus and mother of Agis, all of whom were
      kings, would have the same feeling; if, in your present uneducated state,
      you were to turn your thoughts against her son, she too would be equally
      astonished. But how disgraceful, that we should not have as high a notion
      of what is required in us as our enemies' wives and mothers have of the
      qualities which are required in their assailants! O my friend, be
      persuaded by me, and hear the Delphian inscription, 'Know thyself'—not
      the men whom you think, but these kings are our rivals, and we can only
      overcome them by pains and skill. And if you fail in the required
      qualities, you will fail also in becoming renowned among Hellenes and
      Barbarians, which you seem to desire more than any other man ever desired
      anything.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I entirely believe you; but what are the sort of pains which
      are required, Socrates,—can you tell me?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Yes, I can; but we must take counsel together concerning the
      manner in which both of us may be most improved. For what I am telling you
      of the necessity of education applies to myself as well as to you; and
      there is only one point in which I have an advantage over you.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: What is that?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: I have a guardian who is better and wiser than your guardian,
      Pericles.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Who is he, Socrates?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: God, Alcibiades, who up to this day has not allowed me to
      converse with you; and he inspires in me the faith that I am especially
      designed to bring you to honour.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: You are jesting, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Perhaps, at any rate, I am right in saying that all men greatly
      need pains and care, and you and I above all men.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: You are not far wrong about me.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And certainly not about myself.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: But what can we do?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: There must be no hesitation or cowardice, my friend.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That would not become us, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: No, indeed, and we ought to take counsel together: for do we not
      wish to be as good as possible?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: We do.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: In what sort of virtue?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Plainly, in the virtue of good men.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Who are good in what?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Those, clearly, who are good in the management of affairs.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: What sort of affairs? Equestrian affairs?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You mean that about them we should have recourse to horsemen?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Well, naval affairs?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You mean that we should have recourse to sailors about them?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then what affairs? And who do them?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: The affairs which occupy Athenian gentlemen.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And when you speak of gentlemen, do you mean the wise or the
      unwise?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: The wise.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And a man is good in respect of that in which he is wise?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And evil in respect of that in which he is unwise?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: The shoemaker, for example, is wise in respect of the making of
      shoes?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then he is good in that?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: He is.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But in respect of the making of garments he is unwise?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then in that he is bad?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then upon this view of the matter the same man is good and also
      bad?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But would you say that the good are the same as the bad?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then whom do you call the good?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I mean by the good those who are able to rule in the city.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Not, surely, over horses?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But over men?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: When they are sick?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Or on a voyage?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Or reaping the harvest?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: When they are doing something or nothing?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: When they are doing something, I should say.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: I wish that you would explain to me what this something is.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: When they are having dealings with one another, and using one
      another's services, as we citizens do in our daily life.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Those of whom you speak are ruling over men who are using the
      services of other men?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Are they ruling over the signal-men who give the time to the
      rowers?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No; they are not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: That would be the office of the pilot?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But, perhaps you mean that they rule over flute-players, who
      lead the singers and use the services of the dancers?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: That would be the business of the teacher of the chorus?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then what is the meaning of being able to rule over men who use
      other men?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I mean that they rule over men who have common rights of
      citizenship, and dealings with one another.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And what sort of an art is this? Suppose that I ask you again,
      as I did just now, What art makes men know how to rule over their
      fellow-sailors,—how would you answer?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: The art of the pilot.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And, if I may recur to another old instance, what art enables
      them to rule over their fellow-singers?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: The art of the teacher of the chorus, which you were just now
      mentioning.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And what do you call the art of fellow-citizens?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I should say, good counsel, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And is the art of the pilot evil counsel?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But good counsel?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes, that is what I should say,—good counsel, of which
      the aim is the preservation of the voyagers.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: True. And what is the aim of that other good counsel of which
      you speak?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: The aim is the better order and preservation of the city.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And what is that of which the absence or presence improves and
      preserves the order of the city? Suppose you were to ask me, what is that
      of which the presence or absence improves or preserves the order of the
      body? I should reply, the presence of health and the absence of disease.
      You would say the same?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And if you were to ask me the same question about the eyes, I
      should reply in the same way, 'the presence of sight and the absence of
      blindness;' or about the ears, I should reply, that they were improved and
      were in better case, when deafness was absent, and hearing was present in
      them.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And what would you say of a state? What is that by the presence
      or absence of which the state is improved and better managed and ordered?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I should say, Socrates:—the presence of friendship and
      the absence of hatred and division.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And do you mean by friendship agreement or disagreement?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Agreement.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: What art makes cities agree about numbers?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Arithmetic.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And private individuals?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: The same.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And what art makes each individual agree with himself?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: The same.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And what art makes each of us agree with himself about the
      comparative length of the span and of the cubit? Does not the art of
      measure?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Individuals are agreed with one another about this; and states,
      equally?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And the same holds of the balance?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But what is the other agreement of which you speak, and about
      what? what art can give that agreement? And does that which gives it to
      the state give it also to the individual, so as to make him consistent
      with himself and with another?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I should suppose so.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But what is the nature of the agreement?—answer, and faint
      not.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I mean to say that there should be such friendship and
      agreement as exists between an affectionate father and mother and their
      son, or between brothers, or between husband and wife.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But can a man, Alcibiades, agree with a woman about the spinning
      of wool, which she understands and he does not?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No, truly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Nor has he any need, for spinning is a female accomplishment.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And would a woman agree with a man about the science of arms,
      which she has never learned?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: I suppose that the use of arms would be regarded by you as a
      male accomplishment?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: It would.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then, upon your view, women and men have two sorts of knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then in their knowledge there is no agreement of women and men?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: There is not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Nor can there be friendship, if friendship is agreement?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Plainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then women are not loved by men when they do their own work?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I suppose not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Nor men by women when they do their own work?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: No.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Nor are states well administered, when individuals do their own
      work?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I should rather think, Socrates, that the reverse is the
      truth. (Compare Republic.)
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: What! do you mean to say that states are well administered when
      friendship is absent, the presence of which, as we were saying, alone
      secures their good order?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: But I should say that there is friendship among them, for this
      very reason, that the two parties respectively do their own work.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: That was not what you were saying before; and what do you mean
      now by affirming that friendship exists when there is no agreement? How
      can there be agreement about matters which the one party knows, and of
      which the other is in ignorance?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And when individuals are doing their own work, are they doing
      what is just or unjust?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: What is just, certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And when individuals do what is just in the state, is there no
      friendship among them?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I suppose that there must be, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then what do you mean by this friendship or agreement about
      which we must be wise and discreet in order that we may be good men? I
      cannot make out where it exists or among whom; according to you, the same
      persons may sometimes have it, and sometimes not.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: But, indeed, Socrates, I do not know what I am saying; and I
      have long been, unconsciously to myself, in a most disgraceful state.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Nevertheless, cheer up; at fifty, if you had discovered your
      deficiency, you would have been too old, and the time for taking care of
      yourself would have passed away, but yours is just the age at which the
      discovery should be made.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: And what should he do, Socrates, who would make the discovery?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Answer questions, Alcibiades; and that is a process which, by
      the grace of God, if I may put any faith in my oracle, will be very
      improving to both of us.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: If I can be improved by answering, I will answer.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And first of all, that we may not peradventure be deceived by
      appearances, fancying, perhaps, that we are taking care of ourselves when
      we are not, what is the meaning of a man taking care of himself? and when
      does he take care? Does he take care of himself when he takes care of what
      belongs to him?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I should think so.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: When does a man take care of his feet? Does he not take care of
      them when he takes care of that which belongs to his feet?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I do not understand.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Let me take the hand as an illustration; does not a ring belong
      to the finger, and to the finger only?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And the shoe in like manner to the foot?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And when we take care of our shoes, do we not take care of our
      feet?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I do not comprehend, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But you would admit, Alcibiades, that to take proper care of a
      thing is a correct expression?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And taking proper care means improving?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And what is the art which improves our shoes?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Shoemaking.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then by shoemaking we take care of our shoes?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And do we by shoemaking take care of our feet, or by some other
      art which improves the feet?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: By some other art.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And the same art improves the feet which improves the rest of
      the body?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Which is gymnastic?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then by gymnastic we take care of our feet, and by shoemaking of
      that which belongs to our feet?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And by gymnastic we take care of our hands, and by the art of
      graving rings of that which belongs to our hands?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And by gymnastic we take care of the body, and by the art of
      weaving and the other arts we take care of the things of the body?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then the art which takes care of each thing is different from
      that which takes care of the belongings of each thing?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then in taking care of what belongs to you, you do not take care
      of yourself?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: For the art which takes care of our belongings appears not to be
      the same as that which takes care of ourselves?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Clearly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And now let me ask you what is the art with which we take care
      of ourselves?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I cannot say.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: At any rate, thus much has been admitted, that the art is not
      one which makes any of our possessions, but which makes ourselves better?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But should we ever have known what art makes a shoe better, if
      we did not know a shoe?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Nor should we know what art makes a ring better, if we did not
      know a ring?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And can we ever know what art makes a man better, if we do not
      know what we are ourselves?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And is self-knowledge such an easy thing, and was he to be
      lightly esteemed who inscribed the text on the temple at Delphi? Or is
      self-knowledge a difficult thing, which few are able to attain?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: At times I fancy, Socrates, that anybody can know himself; at
      other times the task appears to be very difficult.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But whether easy or difficult, Alcibiades, still there is no
      other way; knowing what we are, we shall know how to take care of
      ourselves, and if we are ignorant we shall not know.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Well, then, let us see in what way the self-existent can be
      discovered by us; that will give us a chance of discovering our own
      existence, which otherwise we can never know.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: You say truly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Come, now, I beseech you, tell me with whom you are conversing?—with
      whom but with me?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: As I am, with you?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: That is to say, I, Socrates, am talking?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And Alcibiades is my hearer?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And I in talking use words?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And talking and using words have, I suppose, the same meaning?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: To be sure.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And the user is not the same as the thing which he uses?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: What do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: I will explain; the shoemaker, for example, uses a square tool,
      and a circular tool, and other tools for cutting?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But the tool is not the same as the cutter and user of the tool?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Of course not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And in the same way the instrument of the harper is to be
      distinguished from the harper himself?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: It is.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Now the question which I asked was whether you conceive the user
      to be always different from that which he uses?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I do.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then what shall we say of the shoemaker? Does he cut with his
      tools only or with his hands?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: With his hands as well.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: He uses his hands too?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And does he use his eyes in cutting leather?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: He does.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And we admit that the user is not the same with the things which
      he uses?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then the shoemaker and the harper are to be distinguished from
      the hands and feet which they use?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And does not a man use the whole body?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And that which uses is different from that which is used?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then a man is not the same as his own body?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is the inference.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: What is he, then?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I cannot say.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Nay, you can say that he is the user of the body.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And the user of the body is the soul?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes, the soul.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And the soul rules?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Let me make an assertion which will, I think, be universally
      admitted.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: What is it?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: That man is one of three things.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: What are they?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Soul, body, or both together forming a whole.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But did we not say that the actual ruling principle of the body
      is man?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes, we did.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And does the body rule over itself?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: It is subject, as we were saying?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then that is not the principle which we are seeking?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: It would seem not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But may we say that the union of the two rules over the body,
      and consequently that this is man?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Very likely.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: The most unlikely of all things; for if one of the members is
      subject, the two united cannot possibly rule.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But since neither the body, nor the union of the two, is man,
      either man has no real existence, or the soul is man?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Just so.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Is anything more required to prove that the soul is man?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not; the proof is, I think, quite sufficient.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And if the proof, although not perfect, be sufficient, we shall
      be satisfied;—more precise proof will be supplied when we have
      discovered that which we were led to omit, from a fear that the enquiry
      would be too much protracted.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: What was that?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: What I meant, when I said that absolute existence must be first
      considered; but now, instead of absolute existence, we have been
      considering the nature of individual existence, and this may, perhaps, be
      sufficient; for surely there is nothing which may be called more properly
      ourselves than the soul?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: There is nothing.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then we may truly conceive that you and I are conversing with
      one another, soul to soul?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And that is just what I was saying before—that I,
      Socrates, am not arguing or talking with the face of Alcibiades, but with
      the real Alcibiades; or in other words, with his soul.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then he who bids a man know himself, would have him know his
      soul?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That appears to be true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: He whose knowledge only extends to the body, knows the things of
      a man, and not the man himself?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then neither the physician regarded as a physician, nor the
      trainer regarded as a trainer, knows himself?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: He does not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: The husbandmen and the other craftsmen are very far from knowing
      themselves, for they would seem not even to know their own belongings?
      When regarded in relation to the arts which they practise they are even
      further removed from self-knowledge, for they only know the belongings of
      the body, which minister to the body.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then if temperance is the knowledge of self, in respect of his
      art none of them is temperate?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I agree.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And this is the reason why their arts are accounted vulgar, and
      are not such as a good man would practise?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Quite true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Again, he who cherishes his body cherishes not himself, but what
      belongs to him?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But he who cherishes his money, cherishes neither himself nor
      his belongings, but is in a stage yet further removed from himself?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I agree.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then the money-maker has really ceased to be occupied with his
      own concerns?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And if any one has fallen in love with the person of Alcibiades,
      he loves not Alcibiades, but the belongings of Alcibiades?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But he who loves your soul is the true lover?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is the necessary inference.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: The lover of the body goes away when the flower of youth fades?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But he who loves the soul goes not away, as long as the soul
      follows after virtue?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And I am the lover who goes not away, but remains with you, when
      you are no longer young and the rest are gone?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes, Socrates; and therein you do well, and I hope that you
      will remain.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then you must try to look your best.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I will.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: The fact is, that there is only one lover of Alcibiades the son
      of Cleinias; there neither is nor ever has been seemingly any other; and
      he is his darling,—Socrates, the son of Sophroniscus and Phaenarete.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And did you not say, that if I had not spoken first, you were on
      the point of coming to me, and enquiring why I only remained?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: The reason was that I loved you for your own sake, whereas other
      men love what belongs to you; and your beauty, which is not you, is fading
      away, just as your true self is beginning to bloom. And I will never
      desert you, if you are not spoiled and deformed by the Athenian people;
      for the danger which I most fear is that you will become a lover of the
      people and will be spoiled by them. Many a noble Athenian has been ruined
      in this way. For the demus of the great-hearted Erechteus is of a fair
      countenance, but you should see him naked; wherefore observe the caution
      which I give you.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: What caution?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Practise yourself, sweet friend, in learning what you ought to
      know, before you enter on politics; and then you will have an antidote
      which will keep you out of harm's way.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Good advice, Socrates, but I wish that you would explain to me
      in what way I am to take care of myself.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Have we not made an advance? for we are at any rate tolerably
      well agreed as to what we are, and there is no longer any danger, as we
      once feared, that we might be taking care not of ourselves, but of
      something which is not ourselves.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And the next step will be to take care of the soul, and look to
      that?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Leaving the care of our bodies and of our properties to others?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Very good.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But how can we have a perfect knowledge of the things of the
      soul?—For if we know them, then I suppose we shall know ourselves.
      Can we really be ignorant of the excellent meaning of the Delphian
      inscription, of which we were just now speaking?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: What have you in your thoughts, Socrates?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: I will tell you what I suspect to be the meaning and lesson of
      that inscription. Let me take an illustration from sight, which I imagine
      to be the only one suitable to my purpose.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: What do you mean?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Consider; if some one were to say to the eye, 'See thyself,' as
      you might say to a man, 'Know thyself,' what is the nature and meaning of
      this precept? Would not his meaning be:—That the eye should look at
      that in which it would see itself?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And what are the objects in looking at which we see ourselves?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Clearly, Socrates, in looking at mirrors and the like.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Very true; and is there not something of the nature of a mirror
      in our own eyes?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Did you ever observe that the face of the person looking into
      the eye of another is reflected as in a mirror; and in the visual organ
      which is over against him, and which is called the pupil, there is a sort
      of image of the person looking?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is quite true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then the eye, looking at another eye, and at that in the eye
      which is most perfect, and which is the instrument of vision, will there
      see itself?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is evident.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But looking at anything else either in man or in the world, and
      not to what resembles this, it will not see itself?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then if the eye is to see itself, it must look at the eye, and
      at that part of the eye where sight which is the virtue of the eye
      resides?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And if the soul, my dear Alcibiades, is ever to know herself,
      must she not look at the soul; and especially at that part of the soul in
      which her virtue resides, and to any other which is like this?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I agree, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And do we know of any part of our souls more divine than that
      which has to do with wisdom and knowledge?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: There is none.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then this is that part of the soul which resembles the divine;
      and he who looks at this and at the whole class of things divine, will be
      most likely to know himself?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And self-knowledge we agree to be wisdom?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But if we have no self-knowledge and no wisdom, can we ever know
      our own good and evil?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: How can we, Socrates?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You mean, that if you did not know Alcibiades, there would be no
      possibility of your knowing that what belonged to Alcibiades was really
      his?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: It would be quite impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Nor should we know that we were the persons to whom anything
      belonged, if we did not know ourselves?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: How could we?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And if we did not know our own belongings, neither should we
      know the belongings of our belongings?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Clearly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then we were not altogether right in acknowledging just now that
      a man may know what belongs to him and yet not know himself; nay, rather
      he cannot even know the belongings of his belongings; for the discernment
      of the things of self, and of the things which belong to the things of
      self, appear all to be the business of the same man, and of the same art.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: So much may be supposed.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And he who knows not the things which belong to himself, will in
      like manner be ignorant of the things which belong to others?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Very true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And if he knows not the affairs of others, he will not know the
      affairs of states?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then such a man can never be a statesman?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: He cannot.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Nor an economist?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: He cannot.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: He will not know what he is doing?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: He will not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And will not he who is ignorant fall into error?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Assuredly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And if he falls into error will he not fail both in his public
      and private capacity?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes, indeed.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And failing, will he not be miserable?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Very.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And what will become of those for whom he is acting?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: They will be miserable also.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then he who is not wise and good cannot be happy?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: He cannot.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: The bad, then, are miserable?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes, very.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And if so, not he who has riches, but he who has wisdom, is
      delivered from his misery?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Cities, then, if they are to be happy, do not want walls, or
      triremes, or docks, or numbers, or size, Alcibiades, without virtue?
      (Compare Arist. Pol.)
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Indeed they do not.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And you must give the citizens virtue, if you mean to administer
      their affairs rightly or nobly?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But can a man give that which he has not?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then you or any one who means to govern and superintend, not
      only himself and the things of himself, but the state and the things of
      the state, must in the first place acquire virtue.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You have not therefore to obtain power or authority, in order to
      enable you to do what you wish for yourself and the state, but justice and
      wisdom.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Clearly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: You and the state, if you act wisely and justly, will act
      according to the will of God?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: As I was saying before, you will look only at what is bright and
      divine, and act with a view to them?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: In that mirror you will see and know yourselves and your own
      good?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And so you will act rightly and well?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: In which case, I will be security for your happiness.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I accept the security.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: But if you act unrighteously, your eye will turn to the dark and
      godless, and being in darkness and ignorance of yourselves, you will
      probably do deeds of darkness.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Very possibly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: For if a man, my dear Alcibiades, has the power to do what he
      likes, but has no understanding, what is likely to be the result, either
      to him as an individual or to the state—for example, if he be sick
      and is able to do what he likes, not having the mind of a physician—having
      moreover tyrannical power, and no one daring to reprove him, what will
      happen to him? Will he not be likely to have his constitution ruined?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Or again, in a ship, if a man having the power to do what he
      likes, has no intelligence or skill in navigation, do you see what will
      happen to him and to his fellow-sailors?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes; I see that they will all perish.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And in like manner, in a state, and where there is any power and
      authority which is wanting in virtue, will not misfortune, in like manner,
      ensue?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Not tyrannical power, then, my good Alcibiades, should be the
      aim either of individuals or states, if they would be happy, but virtue.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is true.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And before they have virtue, to be commanded by a superior is
      better for men as well as for children? (Compare Arist. Pol.)
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: That is evident.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And that which is better is also nobler?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And what is nobler is more becoming?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then to the bad man slavery is more becoming, because better?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: True.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: Then vice is only suited to a slave?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And virtue to a freeman?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And, O my friend, is not the condition of a slave to be avoided?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Certainly, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And are you now conscious of your own state? And do you know
      whether you are a freeman or not?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I think that I am very conscious indeed of my own state.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And do you know how to escape out of a state which I do not even
      like to name to my beauty?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Yes, I do.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: How?
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: By your help, Socrates.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: That is not well said, Alcibiades.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: What ought I to have said?
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: By the help of God.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: I agree; and I further say, that our relations are likely to
      be reversed. From this day forward, I must and will follow you as you have
      followed me; I will be the disciple, and you shall be my master.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: O that is rare! My love breeds another love: and so like the
      stork I shall be cherished by the bird whom I have hatched.
    </p>
<p>
      ALCIBIADES: Strange, but true; and henceforward I shall begin to think
      about justice.
    </p>
<p>
      SOCRATES: And I hope that you will persist; although I have fears, not
      because I doubt you; but I see the power of the state, which may be too
      much for both of us.

</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
